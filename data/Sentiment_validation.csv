2;Parking was absolutely atrocious,  had to park forever far away and walk. I ordered a shrimp dish and the shrimp was badly over cooked. I had to send it back for the chile verde, which was delicious. Margaritas were great. I think the prices are high for the quality. Nice bathrooms and great service though!
0;Horrible customer service. Ice bar itself is cool but very small. Front desk is disrespectful and does not  care about your experience.\n\nExpensive and not worth it! Save your money!
2;Serves food until 2AM!\n\nSaturday specials: $4 red headed slut shots... I think we are tempted. \n\nToo bad we didn't see the 3rd red head who walked by us as we all agreed to take it on the 3rd one that walks by. :(\n\nI've been eyeing this place for the longest time since I've been seeing my two friends from Arizona checking into this place. Finally got to try it out and....\n\nI only liked the drinks, atmosphere and the pool table. Totally did NOT like the food that night. On their menu, there is a bar snacks and entree section. I decided to eat something small since I know I cannot finish a burger or a taco by myself, so I got the chicken and beef kabobs. Some of you should know how a kabobs look like right? If you don't, they look like this http://yieatn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/kabobs-719954.jpg and what yucca gave me was only meat and no veggies. Disappointed...I wished they at least listed on the menu somewhere 'just meat' When I got the kabobs, my chicken tasted fine, but my beef tasted like it got dipped into salt at least 5x... Ugh. I hope the food only tasted that yucks because of not having enough people in the kitchen. I mean... if you're going to serve bar snacks, it shouldn't take 40-50 mins. Gah....\n\nPool table entertained us the most throughout the night. $1 quarters a game. Plus there's a live band in the other room if you're interested in listening. By the way, there's also another bar in the same room where the band places but only a couple of tables to sit down. \n\nmaybe it's a bad night that we went...I guess we'll have to find out the next time I visit! Until then...this place was OKAY.
1;The locals price is awesome! Food here is pretty decent buffet food. However, I have to say the whole photographer dude asking to take your photo while you wait in line is extremely awkward. I came to the Rio for dinner, not for a photo shoot. What makes it worse is that they're extremely persistent of wanting to take your photo. After you've told them no 10 times (Literally!), then they cop an attitude with you and start talking smack behind your back, just loud enough so you can hear them.
1;"I only went here to have a few drinks, and talk with a friend who wasn't sure if he wanted to eat or not. We were escorted to a table and were cool, the waitress was friendly and tentative since our conversation was rollin'. Long story short we were there for 5 hours, just drinking, and if our waitress could of re-worded her words, our experience wouldn't have been so sour. She came over and stated \""I'm leaving here is the check, if you would like to stay you're more then welcome to order from the bar.\"" So we continued to talk not thinking anything of it, or someone was going to pick up her tip. WELL not two minutes later she comes back to us and says \"" IM LEAVING, I need you to pay your check.\"" At this point me being me, gets a little annoyed, as my friend is looking at me like no she didn't! So he paid as a gentlemen do, and we continued the night, as they dimmed the lights and shut off the music we got the hint we've been talking way to long. If she could have been a tid more polite, it would have been a good experience. The atmosphere was great, the food looked good, but your sour mouth ruined it all."
0;"Want some onions with your Thai food??? I mean seriously, I hope you really, really, really LIKE onions because apparently it's a \""filler\"" for their entrees and a gratuitous one at that. I had a cold so I figured some spicy Tom Ka soup would clear up my head. I order that, my usual which is Pad Woon Sen with Beef and the Special Pumpkin Curry. The total was $32 before tip on the delivery which seemed really high for what I got. Let's start with the soup, the first thing I notice is that there aren't a lot of colors in the container when I take the lid off, just the milky white broth and about, no kidding, 2 whole sliced onions and a few shards of chicken and maybe 3 mushroom slices. This was basically a coconut soup with onions. Horrible. Next the Pad Woon Sen, it's clear bean thread noodles, usually with veggies, fried egg and sauteed meat. I ordered the beef but go the chicken. The noodles were glopped together in a solid mass. I know this is not just a facet of \""delivery\"" because I order this dish from Swaddee Thai delivered all the time and it's not a solid glop of stuck together noodles. It was tasteless and filled with baby corn, again, a cheap canned filler. Lastly the special pumpkin curry. Apparently the only thing special about it is that it costs $10. It was the exact same color sauce as the Tom Ka soup, same flavor too. I dumped it all out in a big bowl and there were only a couple super thin slices of pumpkin, the rest was, you guessed it, white onions. What the heck is with the onions???? It also had green bell pepper that was cooked so much that it melted in your mouth and not in a \""wow this is amazing\"" way but in a cooked to DEATH kind of way. The carrots in BOTH the pad woon sen and the no-pumpkin pumpkin curry were brown around the edges, disgusting. Overall, this was some of the worst Thai food I've ever had. All three dishes had the same lousy note. The quality was low, ie, overcooked veggies, brown veggies, non-existent main ingredients, etc. It was expensive and basically all got dumped down the garbage disposal. I would not recommend that anyone eat here. I'm sorry I lost $32 PLUS tip! Such a shame because there aren't a lot of Thai delivery places around here. Save your money, go to Swaddee, Thai Basil or Yupha's."
4;We go almost every weekend for bloody Mary's and breakfast in the morning. Mary's are good and the food is excellent! OMG omelette and the breakfast club are great! Service is friendly and attentive. Can't wait to go back!
1;"I was so looking forward to the opening of Charr.  Menu was looking great, right down the street from us,, burgers beers and fries.  How could it go wrong?  \n\nSadly, it just all went wrong.  My wife and I just grabbed a spot at the bar early on a Friday afternoon.  Not too busy at all, early dinner and drinks.  Keep in mind, we are sitting right \""In the Middle of the Bar\"".  Took us what seemed like 5+ mins to get our first drink.  Were then waiting another 5+ mins before we were asked if we would like to order food.  Ok, definitely could have flagged a bartender down for attention if I wanted, but for a first visit was just seeing how the service truly was.  So already, we are off to a bad start.\n\nOur order was to split the Sliders on Mini Garlic Knots, the 5-cheese Melt and order of fries.\n\n1) Sliders were dry and very overcooked.  Was missing the Chipotle mayo and the buns seemed not fresh and too dense with absolutely no Garlic flavor.  Sorry, if you are a burger joint and you put sliders on the menu, they better be damn good.\n\n2) Five Cheese Melt was......incredibly flavorless.  We didn't even finish.  I was shocked.  5 cheeses an grilled sourdough!!!  How is it possible that it could be flavoress?  5 CHEESES! \n\n3) French Fries are the only reason it's not a 1 Star review.  They are really good.  Not the best ever or ground breaking, but still very crisp and delicious.  Their is no way in hell they are worth $6, but they are still good.\n\nMy wife and I promised we would give them one more shot and this time be more vocal if needed.  We really want Charr to work out but if the food and service remains the same, our next visit will sadly be our last."
4;If you're sitting at the bar to get a quick bit to eat, I promise you that you won't be disappointed.  My bartender (native Boston) was friendly, conversational and provided great recommendations and service.  Try the bar menu especially the lamb lollipops.  Off of the regular menu, the beef carpaccio with arugula and lemon vinaigrette was simple and clean.  Very refreshing.  But last but not least, cheesecake with berries was a dessert made for two.  It was light and airy...simply heaven.  I look forward to having a full dining experience there.
1;"It's an upscale burger joint with \""fusion\"" alternatives.\n\nBurger, Fries and a \""coke\"" for $20\n\n*Bachi Burger -   It's a fine line between caramelized and charred. My burger came charred. I ordered med-well and was advise it would be pink in the middle. I said,\""perfect\""....well, that wasn't the case when it showed up.\nThe Bun and Veggies were up to par. I ordered an egg with it and it was cooked perfectly. It was the patty that ruined the meal- the flakes of charred matter killed the burger. I couldn't even taste the red onion\n\n*Just Fries -  Over priced ($3.50) for plain skinny fries. \n\n*Root Beer -  Soda machine needs calibration. $2.50 for a flat soda. I asked for another and they cranked up the carbonation mix and it tasted too carbonated.\n\nThe only reason why the place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is the atmosphere and its employees.The manager was very apologetic and asked what she could do to make it up.\n\nSorry Bachi, I can get a decent burger, fries and \""coke\"" for $10 at fuddruckers or fatburger. And for a little over $5 I can get an In-n-out burger.\n\nFor $20 - go to the Eiffel Tower Restaurant inside Paris Hotel and Casino and order a Lamb Burger (5 stars). There's a dress code; so no flip-flops and shorts"
4;Staff is really friendly and the food is good, but standard, Mexican food. The drink specials are probably the best in Charlotte.  A 14oz frozen Margarita for $3 and a 22oz Dos Equis draft for $2.75 is pretty unbeatable.
3;Both times we have been there have been very enjoyable. We knew what to expect, a nice and slightly snooty wine bar. And we were happy! They have beer, and handcrafted cocktails as well. The bar menu is limited  to charcuterie platters, but they are very very good!
2;Some new-opening jitters.  Wait staff isn't really comfortable yet, but this place has all kinds of potential.  It's the second outlet for Chef Charles Schwerd's (Arrowhead Grill) talents.  Our first dinner was a little mixed.  The seven layer salad was very good and Jo-Ann's short ribs were tender and tasty.  But both entrees seemed a bit sweet for her tastes.  The margaritas were just fair and the gimlet was just too watery (too much shaking?)  The wine list was very limited and the wine glasses are just too large for the 5.5 oz pour.\n\nThis new restaurant definitely deserves a go-back.  We need a nice place in this end and Blu Agave could just be it.
3;Excellent food, pricey, great waitress, empty the night we went. It was well worth the money once.
1;Hope you're not in a hurry...2hour wait, have screwed up my records in past visits, no one really seems to know what's going on...doctors are fine, but service is atrocious...if u cannot handle the schedule, you need to reduce how many you see a day
0;The people who gave this place good reviews either had one too many drink special or have no taste buds. This food is bland as all get out. A jar of sauce is preferable, at least then there might be some kind of seasoning and nothing undercooked. This place is the restaurant equivalent of Kraft cheese - yes, it's technically edible, but why would you want to when there are so many better options?
3;You really must go go and try the Hash House A Go Go. It is like a hopped up uberdiner where the food is gourmet and the portions are humongous.\n\nI ordered the smallest breakfast I could find on the menu, eggs, potatoes and toast.  That's it. No bacon, no ham, no sausage...\n\nI could only eat about half of it.  Eggs were great, toast was great, potatoes were great.\n\nMy only criticism is that the coffee was only ok.\n\nI think I figured out the issue.  There is a portal to Idaho in the kitchen.  They have not been able to stop the flow of potatoes from this portal.  The only choice they have to keep the potatoes in check is to send out every order with 2 pounds of chunk potatoes.
3;The owner is usually here and he is very friendly. I had the lentil soup that everyone raves about, it is good but mine is better! The fattoush is fab and the veggie dishes are all great. I always get the Mezza appetizer-  a plate of pure deliciousness!! Their tabbouleh is some of the best I have had. Great little place with good prices.
1;"Driving up Thomas I almost swerved to the side when I saw a Thai restaurant in this part of town! Signs of the old Wendy's or Mexican restaurant that lasted for a month or 2 were nowhere to be seen, instead you had a very modern and inviting sign that even tells you how to pronounce the name of the restaurant. I was hooked, I could not wait to go and check it out. Upon walking in you are greeted by a very modern decor and it screams intimate dinners can be had here. The wood is dark, the tables are black and the lighting is mostly candlelit. The music was soft and contemporary, the only thing that seemed at odd was the flat-screen TV with sports on it. When the waitress handed me the menu, I was SHOCKED at the prices. I was also shocked that there was NO CURRY (besides massaman beef). The food smelled delicious, so I decided it was probably worth it to stay and give them the chance to woo me. After a few awkward moments of looking at the waitress and her trying to figure out if she should come over and take our order or give us more time she finally came over. We decided on 2 Thai iced coffees, crab won-tons as an appetizer and we would share the pad si ew. \n\nIf you've had Thai iced coffee, you can't wait to get the sweet milky goodness all mixed up to drink. This unfortunately was like drinking Folgers with some cream and sugar added, i was beyond disappointed to say the least. I should have had a clue though when I saw it being dispensed from one of those juice machines that you see in the the Mexican places with \""agua frescas\"". \n\nAnyhow, the won-tons come out, and they are possibly the prettiest things I have ever seen on a plate, they tasted amazing, but the filling was cold. \n\nThe pad si ew was nothing to write home about, for the price we did expect the portion to be larger. \n\n\nOverall they did an amazing job in creating an inviting intimate atmosphere, it would definitely be better sans TV. \n\nService was ok. \n\nPrices should definitely reflect location and the demographics of the area, I could just drive to Tempe and get a better meal that is cheaper. \n\n\nHope they adjust accordingly."
1;"I wanted to like this bar; great name, good location, but... the food was nothing special and the service was not good. a \""please seat yourself\"" sign at the door followed by a good 10-15minutes before anyone stopped by the table for drinks and menus. drinks sat unfilled until someone bothered to come by and check up. the place wasn't even busy enough to warrant the poor service. \n\ni'd be willing to give it a second shot, probably."
0;WARNING! KEEP YOUR RECEIPTS AND CHECK YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENTS. I got charged 86 dollars when I only signed for 17. I called and the manager was able to fix it for me. But something like this should not have happened in the first place.
3;You know, at first I was a little skeptical to go to another burger joint.. But after we got in there, our waitress( I forgot your name, sorry blonde lady!!) was very good and she was awesome at what she did! I recommend this place, the food was very good if you like burgers, will be coming back for sure.
1;Only speaking of the club: whenever I go here we get in free and last time we got free drink bands.  But even though we didn't have to drop a dime, we never stay for more than 30 minutes.  The bartenders are rude.  The dance floor is tiny.  The crowd was ok.  Decor is really nice.  But there's nothing about this club to keep you wanting to stay around.  Especially considering all the other clubs in close proximity.  I think they try to lure the hotel guests in order for this place to gain exposure.
2;We went here for Thanksgiving dinner. The only thing impressive about it was our waiter. Alphonso gave us great service and his full attention. It's probably not the best night to dine out. However, I was not impressed by any of the food. We shared porterhouse for two and as the rest was nothing special. I can't say the food was bad, just average and boring. Except the creamed corn My husband thought it was the best thing he's ever eaten. Asparagus was cold and tasteless.Would never go back.
3;I've been to a few other Ruth's Chris's before and this one looked more like a hole in the wall.  If you weren't looking for it, you just might miss it.  Aside from the physical appearance on the outisde, the interior did lack some of the more romantic, dark, fine dining ambiance than other locations.  \n\n I came for a reception this time and found the food still very good.  Our Filet Mignon's came in hot plates.  The meat was tender and smelled delicious in the buttery sauce.  Our sides were mashed potatoes, mushrooms, and cream of spinach.  I did have higher expectations for the cream of spinach because Ruths Chris makes them the best. but this time it wasn't as creamy and it stuck like cheese a little.  in terms of quality, temperature, and taste of my Filet.  It was delicious especailly for a large party for a wedding banquet.  \n\nService was very good and efficient.  Enjoyable.
3;We pulled up to the Rose and Crown, Sara and me looked at each other and shrugged our shoulders and got out of the car. The place is an old house converted into a small restaurant. There is a large inviting porch with seats and heaters. At just inside the door there is a welcome station that doubles as a host area. We ordered our drinks from here and headed out onto the porch. I ordered a beer, a kilt lifter to be precise. Sara asked for the cheapest cabernet and she received a large glass sporting one third of the bottle. We both decided to order the pub platter, half an order of fish and chips and a bowl of New England clam chowder. The service was fast and sitting on the porch felt comfortable. The food was great the portions were good and the price was fabulous. The parking was easy, on Sunday right in front of the pub. Any other day the Rose and Crown will be a little mote difficult to get to. Bill total was less than $30 bucks a bargain for a cozy little hangout next to ASU.
0;Couldn't find this on Yelp so I actually went out of my way to add it so I could post a bad review.\n\nI will usually give a place the 3 strikes rule before vowing never to return, well when you get 3 strikes in one visit, I don't think it even warrants trying for more.\n\nI will say I have been here a few times in the past and although not the best Oyster Bar in town, it was OK and close to home.\n\nWas in the mood for seafood, specifically crab legs...went on the website and low and behold there was special on legs.  Get there at 5:30, no crowd, maybe 4 tables.  No hostess, ok guess that is the norm for mid week.  Printed menu was completely different from what was on the web and changed since past visits - STRIKE ONE\n\nOk let me get a beer to calm the nerves cause I got in-laws in our party of six, I already called out the first strike and where the hell is our waitress.  Guess the party of 6 scared her off.  I proceed to order a micro brew from the menu and was sitting patiently.  After everyone gets their drinks someone I expect to be the sit in F&B manager (he looked the part) came by to tell me the micro brew is no longer served her, was just a temporary thing for football season.  Well shucks here I am watching some Basketball thinking I should have know football season was over and wouldn't have bothered ordering it off the menu you printed and not bothered changing for 2 months now, I know the economy is bad but a $2 sharpie could have save you here - STRIKE TWO\n\nUtterly distraught now I don't even know what to order - settled for the Lobster Fra Diavolo which I hope will recover a meal which in my mind was already headed for a 2 star on Yelp no matter how spectacular the meal would be.\n\nI am no Oyster Bar expert and I would find it a challenge to put together a good gumbo or pan roast but I know seafood.  So when you bring me a bowl of linguine noodles with a can of crushed tomatoes thrown in and toss in some par boiled - not even fully cooked slivers of lobster I'm going to complain.  I can't remember the last time I sent a dish back but I can tell you before the last meal was brought out of the kitchen mine was going to opposite direction.  The waitress was nice enough to offer to have them cook the lobster more but in my mind not even satan himself could bring the Fra Diavolo (brother devil) to an acceptable level - there was no lobster, the sauce was no here near spicy then only thing not messed up was the linguine. -STRIKE THREE AND WE ARE OUTTA HERE.
3;Great food and drinks here. Its a great place to just come and chill if you wanna have a relaxed night. At the end of the night they pulled out karaoke and a ping pong table. It was awesome.\n\nFor my first review, I had to mention this place first. \n\nGood food and good service.
0;This place is priceless,.a big rip! I ordered the thai bbq ribs, well,its a cheap steak thrown on a grill wity thai sauce to dip it, i really need a steak knife to cut this steak,all i had ws a butter knife\n.wht i really needed was a buzz saw,.i would not give this to my dog!!
4;I have got to stay here for new years someday! the cosmo has always been nice to me! the pools are so relaxing and last but not least.... secret pizza! hush. if you don't know...oh well.  dining overall is great! I can walk in and come across someone I know, this place has had good vibes! keep it that way pls!!
1;"I've been coming to this venue for years. I've seen it go through numerous changes and I have to say, it seems to have Improved over the years. \n\nI think they finally have sufficient AC running through this place. It used to be you'd almost die in the audience because it was so hot. They had giant fans to cool the place but they didn't do the job. Glad they finally fixed that issue. \n\nCouple of complaints with this place; bartenders are not friendly. I'm talking about the bartenders in front house upon entrance. Mostly talking the female bartenders I encountered. \n\nAlso, their security staff is verbally abusive and downright misogynstic. I was called an asshole by one of the men in the security staff who was short, bald, and white. Sort of looks like he just got out of prison. I plan to call and complain. He also said some other choice words that I don't wish to share, all because we were having fun and waiting for a band to exit so we could meet them. Apparently they get very annoyed when you do this. \n\n2 stars because I've been to some great shows here. Obviously they could use some work on their staff though."
2;"Great job done as far as the quality of the refinishing of the cabinets. However when they installed the new hinges they used 1/4\"" screws. I had to replace every screw on every hing in my house as the doors started to fall off. Like I said though, very good quality on refinishing."
2;What can I say, my wife loves the days at the spa, so I decided to gift her a massage at Qua after reading all the reviews.\n\nShe did really did enjoy it, but was a bit annoyed with one thing.  Her appointment was at 7:00 and they close at 8.  So she was very rushed and felt a bit jipped.  We would of gladly scheduled earlier if we had been warned.\n\nIf it wasnt for the rushed pressure, Im sure she would of given it all 5 stars.
0;Yeah, no. Bouchon in Vegas was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in the city of sin.  The service was okay, but the food just wasnt there and I'm not even comparing it to Per Se or the Laundry.  It just wasnt good.  But I guess if you're in town and you feel like splurging or you just have to be in a Keller restaurant, go for it.  I'd think twice though.
0;You feel like you're in a used car lot.  The staff is WAY too aggressive with sales, my last Dental office treated patients more like a real Doctor,  not just a customer to see how much money they can get out of every visit.
4;Every morsel we ate caused a party in our mouths. You must try the marscarpone cheesecake. Leave room in your bellies!!
1;Food was delicious, as always but the service was NOT good. Our waitress was named Rachael I think? Something like that, idk. Took 10 minutes to even come to the table. My boyfriend and I side tipped the busser. He did all the work. If I didn't LOVE Firefly, you can bet I'd never go there again.
1;"I feel very conflicted in writing this review, but I think it needs to be written. Our party arrived at 4:30pm in order to get a good view of the TVs for Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Finals.\n\nThe good: Food. Everything we ordered came out cooked well and tasted fantastic. The beer cheese? AMAZING. Pulled Pork? Fantastic. After ordering fries from the happy hour menu (more on this later), it took about 20 minutes to get them. Our server gave us a second order at no charge. That's really where the \""good\"" ends.\n\nThe bad: They didn't have ANY drinks available for happy hour! What kind of bar, new or old, doesn't have drinks available for happy hour?! It's on the menu, but they \""haven't figured out the pricing for it yet.\"" So you still pay Strip prices for alcohol. This was a huge disappointment that they hopefully fix very soon.\n\nThe UGLY: After being there for a couple hours (3 periods, plus intermissions and OT), someone decided to change the channel in the middle of the OT period. We waited for about 2 minutes before we bailed on our check and ran down the way to Yard House who had the game on. We did come back to pay our check and watch the second OT period, but they had split up our table and didn't put the game back on the TV we had been watching. Our server apologized, but the only comment we received from management was \""you should've stayed. They got the game back on,\"" met with a chuckle. As a Kings fan, during the eventual Cup winning game, I felt this was very rude and a little bit disrespectful.\n\nI won't trust Tilted Kilt LV to air any professional sport in its entirety from here out. I understand it could have been a freak incident, but to cause customers and fans to potentially miss the game winning goal and NOT APOLOGIZING is pathetic. They are lucky we were honest people that came back to pay the check. Get your issues hashed out and put booze on the happy hour menu and MAYBE I'll change my star rating. Until then, I won't recommend this place to anyone."
3;Every dish we ordered were very good, especially the wagyu beef tartare.  The service was good, too.  I also like the restaurant setting.  Highly recommended!
2;I like Moe's. This location has some of the nicest employees I have ever seen and the food is usually pretty good. I love the burritos and the bowls. They finally have a couple of good salsa options. The drink machine is the bomb - only place I drink a vanilla coke! \n\nBUT there is a problem:\nI had dinner with a friend here and the constant 'WELCOME TO MOE'S' was just too much. I don't usually mind it but during the dinner hours when someone is always coming thru the door - it is annoying and way too loud! I could not carry on a conversation with my friend so the meal was not very enjoyable.
1;I just don't get all the rave reviews, unfortunately there is no real good breakfast on this side of town. Go to Hash House if you want a real breakfast.  My wife and I ate here, hoping for the best, received salty as heck greasy chicken fried steak. They haven't got a clue how to prepare this American staple... Go to Omelette House  if you want bigger bang for your dollar and tastier food.
0;Service was good. I ordered the jack Daniels burger, which I had before. My wife ordered the basaltmic chicken salad, and my four year old daughter ordered the Mac n cheese. We had the shirmp cocktail as an appetizer. The shirmp cocktail was not good as the shrimps were kinda soggy. My burger was much smaller than my previous visits, flavor was good. When the plate came, I mostly saw empty plate. I mean if they are going to make the burgers smaller, at least fill the rest of the plate with French fries.mi think maybe there were fifteen total fries, maybe a half a potatoe worth.  My daughters Mac n cheese was much smaller than before. About a half of a cup of Mac n cheese. My wife's salad was lettuce and a half breast worth of chicken. After 70 dollars later, we left hungry. First time I didn't take to go boxes home. Don't go to TGIF if your hungry. I understand portion sizes are always too big, but cut the price down, and when I go out to eat I like to feel full.
1;I'm not a huge fan of this store.  I normally only go into Ross Stores to pick up something specific.  Today, my son wanted to get a pair of cheap, throwaway sunglasses.\n\nWe went into the store and found what we were looking for in 3 minutes....unfortunately, it took 20 minutes to check out.  The line was wrapped across the aisle and into the clothing section.  There was only 1 cashier for a long time.  After about 10 minutes, someone finally came to help her.\n\nI don't like how disorganized this store is.  There is always stuff out of place and it never seems to be in good shape.\n\nWill I come back?  Only when I have to.
4;Bellagio buffet vs. the Wynn buffet?  I had dinner at both places on consecutive days and made it a point to go hungry.  The result: Bellagio by tko.\n\nThis place has fresh tuna, moist prime rib, desserts with more depth and character, better ice tea, better french sour dough, and a better salad selection.  By short contrast, the Wynn had no tuna, pathetic desserts that tasted oily rather than rich, dry prime rib, nasty rasberry flavored ice tea, and horrible service.\n\nDon't waste your money anywhere else.  If you're going to binge on food to plump yourself up, be nice to yourself and eat here instead.  \n\nOne negative was the crab.  They started slicing the crab legs in half and as a result, they've become freezer burned with an iodine aftertaste.  Now the legs are dry and salty.  Why fuck up a good thing?  It's the same at the Wynn.\n\nTip: Anticipate a line that runs 1/2 to an hour on busier days.  Sometimes longer.  The wait time on my last visit was only 10 minutes so you never know.
2;"Consider this a 2.5 star.\n\nI wouldn't call this place bad.  They have a nice selection of breakfast options, good service and fair pricing.  But for a place called \""Original Pancake House\"", the pancakes simply aren't that good.  Imagine my surprise :/  \n\nNow, I am not saying the food is bad... I am just saying... not that great.  And the flagship item, pancakes, were the main culprit.  Maybe it was an off day, but my pancakes were not the light, fluffy, buttery goodness, that I would've expected.  Instead, they smelled and tasted of straight up yeast.  I've never had that experience before.  Yeast in my bread?  Yaaaas! Yeasty pancakes?  Not so much.  Plus there was a curious lack of selection in the syrup/honey department.  I mean, it's a pancake house--shouldn't' there be some pouring options?!\n\nMaybe i'll give them another try someday, but for today I remain disappointed."
4;I have been here roughly half a dozen times and my experiences have been consistently good.  I have had everything from eggs and grits to hamburgers and apple pie and it is all delicious.  You just can't go wrong here.\n\nAside from the food, I love the fact that this is a 50's throwback diner.  You would think it has been around for years but in fact it is pretty new.  Despite it being a fairly recent addition to Charlotte, this diner has character that usually comes with age and lends itself as a great haunt for all times of day and night.\n\nA quick tip: Saturday and Sunday get very busy so either be prepared to wait or time your arrival (especially on Sunday - be mindful as to when church services get out).
0;First impression was good.  The place looks nice and the addition to the building was nicely done.\n\nWe stopped for a late lunch.  We ordered a bloody mary and asked for water as well.  We had to remind the waitress twice to bring the water and we were halfway through our meal when it finally arrived.  Not a big deal.\n\nWe didn't want a large meal so ordered appetizers.  The Chips and Salsa were mediocre at best.  The guacamole was definitely not home made---more of the variety that comes in the squeeze tube from Sam's Club.  The menu said the chips were home made.  I'm not saying they were lying, but the tri-colored chips sure seemed like any garden variety you could get at Sam's, Costco or any other grocery store.\n\nThe cheese quesadilla was better, although the guacamole once again was free of any evidence that it was made on site.  \n\nThe drinks were good.  \n\nWhat disappointed me were two things, one of which will guarantee that a return trip to this restaurant will be delayed until they work out the new restaurant kinks.\n\nFirst, I went to the mens room.  As the restaurant had been newly renovated, I was surprised to find a smelly, hot and humid mens room that had obviously not been recently cleaned.  They definitely did not renovate the restroom from it's original incarnation when it was the Gallery.  It is a hot and humid Wisconsin day and there are no air conditioning vents in the restroom.  Instead a window is propped open.  It was a smelly, disgusting, hot and humid room.  A few hundred dollars more to what was obviously a costly renovation and they could have freshened it up and run an AC line into the restroom.\n\nFrankly, I wish I wouldn't have gone to the restroom before I ate since it dampened my appetite significantly.\n\nThe worst thing though, is something I witnessed after we had paid our bill and were getting ready to leave.  We were seated in the bar area and one of the waiters approached the bar and placed an order for drinks for two women who were seated outside.  One of them ordered a draft beer.   \n\nWhen the bartender pours the beer, the glass overflowed.  She then picked up the glass with all five finger wrapped around the top of the glass.  This alone is disgusting, unhygienic and goes against all of the basics of germ control.  What happened next was the topper, though.   As I said the beer overflowed on rim and side of the glass.  In front of the waiter and with any customer within eyesight able to see she took the BAR RAG and wiped off the glass and the rim of the glass.  \n\nThe potential for cross contamination from the bar rag to the rim of the glass (and the customers lips) creates the possibility for incredible pathogen transmission.  While I am sure this was unintentional, it is nonetheless unconscionable and is reason enough for the health department to intervene with severe sanctions.\n\nAs we left, I saw the waiter delivering the tainted glass of beer to an unsuspecting customer.  I couldn't walk by without saying something, so I told the customer what I witnessed.  I hope she demanded a replacement and/or decided to walk down the street to another restaurant.\n\nI hope they get their act together.  It's a good location and has potential.  However, with what I witnessed today and with the disgusting restroom experience, I predict that this recent addition to Middleton's sparse dining scene will be short lived.
0;6:20 pm: Ordered two ridiculously simple pizzas (1 small deep dish pepperoni, 1 small thin crust cheese) online, the confirmation code said we could expect it delivered by 7:11. \nAt 7:45, we called the store and were told the delivery driver was on his way with our order. \n8:05, we called back. Snarky phone guy asked us if we were sure we actually ordered online, then if we were sure we ordered from the Montford location, before retaking our order and telling us that we had to present our confirmation code at the door before getting our pizzas that we'd have to wait ANOTHER 45 minutes for... although our order was supposedly already prepared and out for delivery. We finally got our food around 9:30 pm.\n\nI don't understand what took so long for such a simple order on a Sunday, or why we were met with such suspicion over our order. Did someone at Jet's get a little hungry and hope we wouldn't notice when dinner never came?\nThese questions may never be answered, but one thing is for sure: if there's anything I love more than being hungry, it's having to jump through hoops for the food I've already been charged for! Thanks, Jet's!
1;"Went here on my sister's recommendation, as she adores the Santa Monica Location.  However, even she agreed that this particular place was not up to par.\n\nIn any case, the highlight of the evening was the steak itself.  Cooked as requested, my dry aged NY strip was tasty.  Also, the service was appropriately attentive and friendly.  Outside of that though...little was going right that evening.\n\nThe first issue came up when I scanned the menu.  Cool, you get to choose from a variety of steaks, from traditional corn-fed to \""organic\"" to , uh oh, Kobe.  Intrigued by the organic offering, I kindly ask our waiter if he could tell me about where they get their organic meat, and if he could tell me if it's partially or completely grass fed.  After hemming and hawing for a bit, he says, 'actually, I don't know...let me go check.'  After a couple of minutes, he comes back and tells me that he's unable to find further information about the organic beef, and how it's raised.\n\nRed flag on the play, 10 yard penalty, still first down.  Sounds like there's more marketing on the menu than actual care put into the beef.  Suddenly, the Kobe and Organic offerings don't appeal to me anymore. If they don't care enough to know the origins of their specialty meats, how can I possibly expect them to cook them properly?   To give them the benefit of the doubt, I went with a traditional corn-fed steak-- A good move, as I mentioned earlier.\n\nIt comes with a selection of sauces, and I decided to go with Bernaise...as it's always a favorite accompaniment of mine.  To start with I ordered up the Steak Tartare prepared tableside...I was in a beefy mood, what can I say?\n\nThe tartare came, and it wasn't anything special.  They included a quail egg, which is no big foul, but I've always preferred a good amount of yolk to accompany my chopped beef.  Also, it was doused with olive oil and set on top of bitter greens, and served with toasted baguette.  In the end, the preparation masked the pure beefyness that is the only reason for ordering tartare in the first place.  I still long to find the yummy baseballs of fillet and yolk that I'd get in most any Parisian Bistro.\n\nOn to the NY Strip.  Got it with a side of asparagus....limp and stringy, someone forgot to peel the bottoms.  Got to the Bernaise...but it was just way too buttery and missing the balance of a good Bernaise.  I guess they really must be afraid of egg yolk in this joint.  As a backup I tried their J-1 sauce...hmm, it's just like A-1 except not a sweet.  Okay, never mind then, I'll just skip the sauce and go for the meat.\n\nIn the end, the faux Laguiole steak knife on the table pretty much summed things up.  Most everything looks pretty and sounds good...but there just isn't enough substance and care put into the food or the cooking for me to really enjoy it."
1;"I too am a big Pita Jungle fan, and have been  eagerly awaiting the opening of the new  FLW/Thompson Peak location.   I called today around 3 p.m.  and placed a take-out order for  the lentil fatoush salad, which I've had many, many times at other locations and always thoroughly enjoyed.    Upon arriving,  I was a bit \nsurprised to see how small the restaurant  actually is, based upon the size of their Shea and Tatum locations - I'm sure it has to be difficult getting a table during typical lunch and dinner times.   Also guessing that parking might be an issue; the area right outside the restaurant is not very large.  Obviously the Safeway shopping center has other parking areas to handle the overflow but it could potentially be a hike - not ideal when it gets hot.  Anyways, long story short, my salad was waiting for me, I paid, and brought it home.  Opened it up and discovered they forgot to put in the salad dressing.     Ate it without, consoling myself how many fewer calories I was consuming without the dressing, but it was pretty disappointing - the dressing is a huge component of the salad.  Also disappointing were the onions in it - the carmelized ones were burnt, and the raw chopped red was overwhelmingly  strong.    Even the cucumbers had an odd taste to them.   I think I'll continue to visit the Shea location until this one has been up and running a bit longer - they seem to have some kinks to iron out."
1;It tempted us with unconventional, sunny Mexican style architecture, but amount of time we had to spend inside to get regular coffee added up to about 20 min. And we were almost only ones there! Worst sbux ever.
0;Sad to say but this review won't be a good one. Perhaps if we chose to sit in the normal seating area things would have went different. We sat in the bar & there was only 1 waitress to service the whole area & of course it's super bowl sunday. \nWaters had floaties-yuk. The waitress says it looks like it's from lemons so of course we say we didn't have lemons with our water. So we get some new waters. Next is the appetizer- chips, salsa & bean dip with a side of hair in the beans. The kid's fries came with a complimentary salt like. So much salt on these bad boys you'd think it was a cured prime rib. Chicken came out raw so that went back to the kitchen. \nBut my favorite of all the unpleasantries was the fact that I had to try & enjoy my meal with a stack full of dirty plates in my face the whole entire meal. \nMy girlfriend had a nice friendly chat with the manager & he comped our entire meal. I always feel bad for complaining but there was so much wrong that sometimes you gotta stand up & say something.
0;I usually like Red Robin.  Normally the food is good and portions are huge.  This was my first time at the Happy Valley location.  The service was fine.  This single star rating is for the food.\n\nI got the Prime Rib sandwich and it was incredibly small.  There was almost no meat on it.  The sandwich was over $13.  I don't know if they've decreased their portion size or what, but I would never have expected that from Red Robin.\n\nI would not recommend this place.  However, I might eventually try another Red Robbin.
4;"I came to the Wynn specifically to enjoy SW Steakhouse. I pulled up to the complimentary valet. They work solely on tips. I went to the restaurant and enjoyed one of the best meals of my life for a little under two hours (see my SW Steakhouse review for the delectable details!). The valet was an extremely convenient option versus self parking and walking some distance. The restaurant is really close to the valet entrance.\n\nAfter dinner, I hit the casino floor in hopes of recuperating some of the $300 I had just spent on my meal. I told myself I was going to gamble $100 only, which usually turns out to be a disastrous attempt at self control (one word: ATM).\n\nWynn boasts the latest in slots, video poker, roulette, and table games (blackjack, pai gow, etc). There is a wide selection of games, and friendly staff. Getting a player card is a breeze, and I've never had a machine malfunction on me. Overall a great place to play slots and video poker. Don't forget to indulge in some free drinks while you're playing; just remember to tip your cocktail server.\n\nI put $100 into a roulette machine. I like a system of betting 2 of the 3 grouped number fields, i.e. 1st 12, 2nd 12, or 3rd 12. This way you have a 2/3 chance of winning one unit on every spin. For example bet $20 on 1st 12 and $20 on 2nd 12. If you win, you win $20. If you lose, you lose $40. I've gone on a winning streak of $800 before at the Wynn using this system, betting in $20 increments. That means I won a total of 40 units. Be cognizant of the 0 and 00. These put you at slightly less than 2/3 odds to win. Tonight's session didn't work out so well. After numerous bets, I was down to $60 and decided to cut my losses. I moved on to my favorite casino video poker machine - 100 play draw poker.\n\n*Do not gamble. Gambling typically results in loss of money. (Author assumes no responsibility for anyone ignoring this advice.)\n\nOn previous visits I have noticed about four different 100 play draw poker machines at the Wynn. I saw one and immediately sat down. They're usually pretty popular so I was surprised I found an open one right away. I was only betting $5 per hand in order to try to stick to my $100 limit. So with my remaining $60 I began my 100 play draw poker adventure.\n\nI was getting dealt crap and was down to $15. On the next, magical hand, I was dealt four 8's. So my $15 jumped up to $260. I started with $100 in the roulette machine, and left the draw poker machine with $250. $150 profit. I was a happy camper and got the hell outta there. In essence, my $300 SW Steakhouse meal only cost me $150! That's a win in my book!\n\nAfter having 3 kids, both my desire and resources to gamble have dwindled. I was super happy to replenish $150 and leave. I turned in my valet ticket, and my car resurfaced 5 minutes later. I tipped the driver and was on my way.\n\nAs of 12/24/14, only three restaurants in the U.S. offer certified, authentic Kobe beef. Wynn has two of the three (SW Steakhouse and Mizumi).\n\nI've seen Le Reve at the Wynn and it's a beautiful, skillful show. It's almost as good as any cirque du soleil production.\n\nFor a man who is virtually blind, Steve Wynn has precise, creative vision when it comes to the hotel and gaming industry. His properties are some of the best in the world. I highly respect the man and trust any resort with his name on it.\n\nI've stayed at the Wynn several times before and have always enjoyed myself. The rooms are clean and elegant. My parents have a long standing history with Wynn resorts. This relationship goes back to the Bellagio, Treasure Island, and the Mirage. We must've stayed at the Mirage at least ten or eleven times in the 90s. When Steve Wynn opened up his namesake hotel, my family came here and have enjoyed it ever since. Wynn Las Vegas is classy, professional, and top flight. I highly recommend this or Encore for a stay in Las Vegas."
2;Silver dragon has reopened . Their food is good  but service is a little on the slow side. I tried their wanton soup which h is one of their signature dishes however I wished there was more broth. The wantons are great . I ordered their beef chow fun wet style . A lot of beef but lacking on vegetables . It was tasty but a lille on the small portion. I would have rated  3.5
3;The name of this place sounds a little cheesy, cheap and naff, but this does not give an accurate reflection of the quality of the food and service inside.  The staff inside are friendly, efficient and seem to be constantly smiling.  The menu is what you would expect in most Chinese takeaways with plenty to choose from in the way of soups, curries, szechuan and sweet and sour dishes.  I went for the chicken Kung Po which didn't take long at all to be prepared and had an interesting combination of mushrooms, chillies and even peanuts.  It was delicious and I would have it again any day of the week.  This, along with a portion of special fried rice and a can of Irn-Bru, came to about \u00a37 which was certainly reasonable considering the quality of the food.  \nIf you're on Leith Walk, or even fancy a delivery, then Capital Chinese Take Away is well worth a shot.
4;I'm definitely giving a 5 star review due to the service. \n\nWe had our 1 cheat day and I was dead set on a greasy burger. So, we decided to try The Stand and get drive thru. \n\nHowever, when we got home, the bag broke open, spilling all of the food on the concrete parking spot. We were so bummed! I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager, Ron. This is where I'm floored. \n\nRon drove all the way to where we live just to deliver a new set of burgers!! Are you kidding?!? That is AMAZING customer service and REALLY going above and beyond!!!!\n\nThank you so much for turning our night around!! \n\nOh! And you really have to try these shakes. Wow.
2;"You know, this place kind of let me down. I love few things more than breakfast/brunch, and Sugar Factory didn't do it for me. I ordered the eggs Benedict (prepared hard because runny eggs creep me out) over ham and scalloped potatoes. It tasted it fine, but not great. The ham almost seemed deli quality, so that cheapened the meal. I will say the potatoes were really good, and I had a decent mimosa.\n\nAfter my meal I bought hot chocolate and an oatmeal raisin cookie from the adjoining sweet shop. I especially loved that this place was playing R. Kelly's \""Chocolate Factory\"" while I was inside. They followed that up with Soul For Real,'s \""Candy Rain\"" so whoever picks the music has a friend in me.\n\nThis place has cool, fun decor, but just mediocre food and service. I wouldn't mind going back to be proven wrong, but I don't expect fireworks. Maybe breakfast at a sweets shop is not the best idea."
0;Okay please tell me why it took literally 20 minutes to go through three people ahead of me in the deli department? I'm not one to leave bad reviews but walmart- get it together. They are so focused on cutting costs that they don't even have enough he employees to staff the deli. Also, most of the express u scan lanes were closed? Why? They should have more open- saves them money in labor. Stick to target.
0;Never again from.nor do I reccomend Monarch apartments on Coolidge street...or any M.E.B property ....
3;I bought a Groupon for 2 adults for the Arizona Science Center. It was my first visit and I was eager to see the Lost Egypt exhibit. We paid for our son separately. I was a little disappointed with the Lost Egypt exhibit but overall, we had a really great time. My son has been before. He is 10 and loved it. There is an additional fee for IMAX and the Planetarium... Plus, you'll have to pay for parking. However, the parking can be discounted with validation AND the food in The Lab Cafe was reasonably priced. This is a great place for kids. I
2;Sichuan is a region in China known for hot babes. If you know a thing or two about what brings the heat you know that you need the whole package. Pretty and smart gets it done. Taking one without the other you're either shallow or a chump.\n\nYou'll see a ton of these yelp reviews deride the decor or the service or the atmosphere. These are the kinds of kids that like places like Imperial Garden. Who likes that place? (I do. Kind of a lot. I think?). You'll also see a ton of these yelp reviews glow over Sichuan food and eating stuff like oxtail and tripe or pickled soup. I am a big fan, and their spicy crispy chicken is my jam. The only thing I got here that I didn't like was the Kung Pao chicken - it didn't pack much heat and the sauce was thick and sweet. I think they thought I was getting something from the Americanized menu.\n\nSo what kind of babe is Ichiban? Obviously she's the brainy one that doesn't care what you think. I kinda wish she did, though.
1;Food is sub-par/prices average. But hey, I'm from Ca.
3;The staff here are awesome. They know my drink . They have great out door and indoor seating area. The store is very clean and organized. I have had some experiment with bad Starbucks coffee at other Starbucks but not this one.
2;"It wasn't \""A-Ok\"", but I am not a huge fan either. Macaroni grill deserves a little more than an A-okay. It's for sure better than Olive Garden and great for a fast Italian chain. The food was actually decent and reasonably priced.  I will come back again."
3;"I sacrificed myself for this Yelp review. \n\nThe fusion style dogs are different in a good way.  The Banh Mi Dog was great with the sirracha mayo and slaw but the Angry Dog; what did I do to you?  The sausage is spicy and delicious but add the hot sauce and jalapenos and my mouth was on fire.  Add more heat with the angry kimchi fries; OMG! (OK so I did add a side of jalapenos so this is kinda my fault).\n\nThe fries (what I could taste) were overly sweet if eaten on their own.  Break the egg yolk and make a gooey mess out of the whole thing,  the heat abates and you have good eats. \n\nNote:  Unlike most of my reviews, this review is based on a single visit.\n\nWorth a try."
1;I'm not sure how this place has so many good reviews because it seems like the exact sort of place that would be on a TV restaurant fix show. The menu is really eclectic in a confusing sort of way. There is asian food, mexican food, cajun food, greek food, bbq, american, etc. The inside of the restaurant is unspectacular and had an awful odor when we visited. We sat outside in the patio area, which is definitely charming. The outside area is the only reason this place is 2 stars instead of 1.\n\nPrices on the menu are high, for drinks and for food. This would be okay if the drinks and food were better. My $12ish margarita was pretty much all sweet & sour mix. The cheese enchiladas were average and I didn't care too much for the sauce (really spicy without much else flavor). \n\nThe outside area is really cute and adorable. If the drinks were cheaper it'd be a great spot to sit out & relax (and then eat food somewhere else).
0;This review is based ONLY on the incredibly RUDE receptionist. She was rude from the minute we walked in the door and had it not been for other employees would have lost our business instantly! She was only concerned on closing the store within the minute of it's reported closing time. She didn't even want to show us to a salesperson so that she could close exactly on time.
2;Wine list is ok, not what I would have expected for a Wine Spectator award winner, and the markup is ENORMOUS. Generally the fish menu is sustainable but when I commented to the waitress about the CRITICALLY ENDANGERED Chilean sea bass she didn't even know the difference between farmed and wild caught fish let alone what sustainable meant - wait staff needs to be trained on that. Quality and flavor of the dinners was great overall, but the risotto side dish had zero flavor - where's the salt?? Beautiful view but in my opinion NOT totally worth $100 per person for dinner...and that didn't even include an appetizer or dessert!
0;"I'm not sure how people could enjoy food that gets you, your loved ones & friends sick.. Worst food experience of my life~!\n\nOur friends ate here, and told us it was horrible. My boyfriend wanted to try, so what the heck, let's not be biased & try it out right? Well, I am greatly regretting it.\n\nWe ordered korokke to start, which tasted like they just took flour, cooked it, and then served it to us. Worst korokke in my life, which I'm sad about because I love korokke. :(\n\nNext, my boyfriend ordered the Miso Ramen, while I ordered Shoyu Ramen. His Miso Ramen smelled funny, and I thought maybe it's okay, taste it first. So, he tried it, said it tasted sour & weird, then I tried it afterward. He was correct, it tasted nothing like Miso Ramen, it tasted as weird as it smelled. My boyfriend and I hate to complain at restaurants, but his food was not even edible, so we let them know & he had it switched to Shoyu. When his Shoyu came, he tried it & told me his soup spoon smelled funny. He handed it to me & I knew the smell, being a former server at another restaurant. It reeked of bleach, not the amount that you should use for sanitizing, greater than that. As if they poured an entire cup of bleach & just gave it to us. I gave my boyfriend my soup spoon instead, since I didn't really need it.\n\nMy Shoyu Ramen, on the other hand, tasted OK.. There was something about it that tasted weird, but I couldn't figure it out. Not the best Shoyu, and it's usually my favorite. The noodles were aldente on the inside, but gooey/slimy on the outside. From two to three bites, I got really sick for some reason.. So I stopped eating, took it to-go, then tossed it when I got home. :/\n\nMy boyfriend also got really sick, so our friends were right about this place. I don't want anyone else getting sick; one of my friends wants to try it as well, even after our warning. Something has to be done, either figure out what you're doing wrong & fix it, or just close the place down."
0;This place is the biggest rip off! They should be ashamed wanting to charge $29 to change a battery on a cheap Timex watch. I could not stop laughing. They would not tell me how much the battery cost. I took the watch to Victoria at Wall-Mart who charged me the price of the battery which was about $4 and she replaced it at no cost in about 3 minutes. Thanks Victoria!  I also got 2 batteries for the price of one. Screw the warranty at Fast-Fix. Ha-ha.
4;Check it! Oyshi is in the 'hood!  Yeah buddy couldn't wait till they opened got so tired of The Sushi and driving out to Rainbow got to be too much.  Thanks guys for opening up by the Lakes and Sumerlin.
2;A few disappointments. We had to send back a steak because it was overcooked. Ordered asparagus and got string beans instead. I got the bone in rib eye with fois gras. Very good. The cream corn was excellent. Also the beef carpaccio was very good. There were 7 of us this night and most thought it was great. The house bread was a big hit with those that tried it. They have a great sound system with a DJ spinning good stuff but for dinner a bit too loud IMHO. Our waiter though ok just lacked the finesse you would expect at a fine dinning establishment.
3;Great lunch specials! Good wings and pizza!
2;I tried the chiles rellenos again and the covering and sauces were both normal this time.  Since chiles rellenos are my favorite, and they've learned how to make them right in the past 7 months, they get an extra star.  However, they jacked up the prices and 2 chiles rellenos with rice and beans now costs an absurd $14.50.  The food's good but entirely too expensive.
1;I have mixed feelings about this place because I think it has potential, and because I think heavy meat-eaters might like it. I'll start with the good stuff to counter my low stars . . .\n\nThe place is big with a large airy open space in the middle. They have live music on some nights and the space would be good for dancing, though I didn't get the feeling that dancing will be happening here -- maybe I'm wrong? The music that was playing while I was there was definitely not conducive to dancing -- VERY subdued, not that great. \n\nThere are separate (but fairly open) large areas at the sides and backs of the restaurant. These are great spaces for large parties.\n\nThe service was good, the meat-eaters in my group liked the meat (I'm vegan), and the owners spent a nice amount of time chatting with us and answering our questions. They're really trying to do something unique and serve high-quality food. They get their produce from a local farm -- One Windmill Farms -- which is awesome.\n\nBut that's the weird part -- I buy my own produce from that same farm, so I was really surprised to find that the vegetarian food my husband and I ordered was really bland. I don't know if it's the way they prepared the food, or if the produce they got that day just happened to be flavorless, but I have no interest in going back to find out.\n\nSo what did I get? The Angel Hair Pasta and the Bruscetta. It was the most bland pasta dish I've ever eaten. The bruscetta wasn't 100% flavorless -- it was drowning in garlic. I normally love a lot of garlic, but this was definitely overkill, and the tomato and basil were flavorless, just like on the pasta. The bread was too soggy for me, too, but my husband liked it.\n\nThere is an impression that Il Vinaio is a wine bar. It's not. Go to D'Vine if you want a Wine Bar. The wine list at Il Vinaio is limited. I had the Malbec and found it no better quality than any Malbec I can get at a typical restaurant -- just o.k. \n\nOverall, it was the most flavorless food I can remember getting at a restaurant, but it was priced high. \n\n\nBTW, there isn't much for a vegetarian to eat here. That didn't affect my star rating, but since I yelp for vegetarians, I wanted to mention it.
3;I live down the street from Scratch Pastries and LOVE their food.  I haven't sampled everything on their menu but recommend the Quiches, which size wise are big enough to share.  Their mushroom soup is awesome too, just make sure you aren't in a hurry if you order it because it does take some time as they make it as ordered.  Their house dressing is very tasty too.  Usually I avoid a vinaigrette like the plague but this one has a nice flavor without coming across too strong.  The color and consistency is a little weird but once you get past that, you are in salad heaven.  \n\nTheir pastries are amazing and so is their tea selection.  Their Eros tea blend is amazing for you tea lovers out there.  Their desserts? O...M...G!!!  I've died and gone to heaven.\n\nI would have given 5 stars but there are a couple of gripes.  Their hours are kind of random and have changed from the ones they have posted on their window, not sure if the ones on the website are correct?  My other gripe is the only side they have for all of their entrees is a mixed green salad.  I have health issues that make it difficult to eat lettuce/Mixed greens so unless I want to be miserable, I can't eat the side salad.  I even asked my server, explained my dilemma and he said they didn't have anything to substitute.  Oh well, you win some you lose some.
2;"I had a great time. I hate that Ashley A. had a bad first experience, and truly hope that she will give this place a second chance. They might have had a rough start, but they definitely had their stuff together for the dinner rush. \n\nWe got there and saw a couple of chairs open at the bar and decided to head over there. As soon as we sat down the bartender came over, introduced herself and asked what we would like to drink and if we needed menus. \n\nWe ordered our appetizer while we sipped on our first beer - they have a nice selection to choose from by the way. When we got The Rusty Onion, we dug right in. It was a GREAT start to our meal. The caramelized onions, pita chips and sauce are a perfect combination, with just the right amount of spice. Shortly after getting our appetizer, we decided to go ahead and put in our dinner order.\n\nWe couldn't choose just one pie, so we got two personal sized (10\"") pies - The Eye-talian Stallion and the Cheeseburger Dy-no-mite. I have been thinking of coming up with my own Italian sub-style pizza, before I really had the chance to do it on my own, BOOM! I find it at The Rusty Onion. The Eye-talian Stallion is exactly what I had in mind, plus some. The Kalamata olives and artichokes really make this pizza pop. The Cheeseburger Dy-no-mite is the perfect compromise if you can't decide whether you want a pizza or a burger, and it even comes complete with their special sauce drizzled over freshly-shredded lettuce. We couldn't have been happier with the choices we made.\n\nThe food all came out hot and timely. Our bartender was very attentive, without being intrusive to our evening, and we ended up staying for a few more rounds than we had planned.  This place is a must to put on your list of places to try. I am looking forward to trying out more items from their menu."
1;if you find yourself UNABLE to escape the inevitable fate of coming here, DEFINITELY get a pizza. we had the mushroom + caramelized onions white pizza and it was pretty good. \n\nalso, the mints at the hostess desk are pretty good.\n\nhere is where the goodness ends.\n\nNOT GOOD: $60 for average pasta and chicken parmigiana \n\nNOT GOOD: trying to PUSH extra random stuff under the guise that it was complimentary. i understand the need for waiters to SELL the menu with logical pairings but O RLY??\n\nNOT GOOD: hostess sitting us by the door and ALLEGING that it was the only seat available despite the OBVIOUS lack of other similarly numbered parties and empty tables in the premises. we assumed it was because they were waiting for other 4-people parties with reservations but NO ONE CAME IN. our table by the door allowed us to verify our suspicious. IRONY... you taste like mediocre Italian cuisine.\n\nNOT GOOD: perhaps i have been spoiled by the excesses of i dunno, REALITY but i thought it was rather sneaky that they charged one of us $5.00 for a soda. then i realized it was because they charged us for the refill. note that the glasses were those artsy oblong glasses filled to the brim with ice.\n\nTWO STARS for the pizza. that is all.
3;One of the best in overall selection that I've ever experienced.
3;"Une excellente trouvaille \u00e0 Las Vegas! Le restaurant se trouve dans le Mirage, et comme c'est l\u00e0 que je logeais, on a choisit la solution de facilit\u00e9 :)\n\nLes hamburger sont ultra bons, il en existe de nombreux diff\u00e9rents, y compris un hamburger fallafel pour les v\u00e9g\u00e9tariens, o\u00f9 ceux qui font attention \u00e0 leur ligne ;)\nLe tout servi avec des frites en suffisance.  \n\nLa cuisine est en cercle au fond du resaurant, \u00e0 la vue de tout le monde. Trois-quatre cuistots y sont en permanence et il y des grosses flammes qui s'\u00e9chappent des cuisini\u00e8res... Un show en soi !\n\nIl est d'ailleurs possible de prendre plusieurs formules, notamment avec boissons \u00e0 volont\u00e9 :) ou bien avec milkshake (un peu lourd pour manger en m\u00eame temps...)\n\nL'endroit est souvent bien rempli et il y a toujours une file d'attente devant la porte... Mais en y regardant mieux, il y a toujours des tables libres aussi... donc la bonne vieille technique de r\u00e9duire l'offre pour augmenter la demande fonctionne toujours aussi bien... Sacr\u00e9 Steve Jobs  ;-)"
4;Very nice little place. It sort of reminded me of The Place before it became bigger and lost a bit of quality. Great portion sizes and even better prices.
1;The beef, bean and cheese burrito was OK, it was not worth the $8.00 they charged me for it, I could have got two larger one from somewhere else. I will not be going back to this location the prices have increased and the bakery has almost dissappeared, they need to changed the name of this place. One thumb up and one thumb down!
2;Much to my dismay, the BF and I stopped in for a gelato fix and there was a new guy behind the counter, the gelato looked different and all the decor was gone. I asked and the surfer dude who was wearing a chef's coat and a knit skull cap while working behind the counter confirmed that the ownership had changed.  Yikes!  He claims the gelato master sold him all the recipes, but I am skeptical. The gelato I had was okay, but nothing like before. I worry that the magic is gone.
2;I think my boyfriends dreams were crushed lol.\n\nSo I know my boyfriend has had his heart set on a Tiffany's engagement ring for me. He's been looking at the online website, ALOT. He loves surprising me with a gift from there, he thinks the place is the best. Me on the other hand, it's nice but I don't need such a label ! \n\nWe decided to go look what he thought I might like. It's always a cold feeling walking in, ( they need to calm down they just sell jewelry ) But a salesman decided to help us.He was nice enough, but you can tell he was very new or just a very awkward person. I kinda felt bad for him.. Perhaps he just knows the silver area a little better? \nHe wasn't personable, and very non informational. He seemed to be just as nervous or more than my boyfriend!\nI had to get out of there, needed a cocktail watching them lol\n\nWell, I didn't care for the styles that were shown to me, just wasn't my style. If I did I would really wanna have my engagement ring experience to be less tense and more informational!
0;We stopped ordering Dominoes after noticing that their coupon codes are a scam. Pay close attention when you put the code in, many times, while the overall order's price goes down a little, individual items' prices go up. If a business is going to offer coupon codes they shouldn't practice shady, deceptive practices. The pizza itself was ok but not great. Out of the 3 times we've ordered from Dominoes (online), we've experienced problems 2 times. \n\nThe first time, the order went through online, then no pizza almost 1.5 hours later. Calls to the store = no answer (8-10 times) and then one answer in which the individual lied and told us it was on the way. We ended up having to contact their regional management office to get the situation sorted out. They gave us a $30 credit to our account that we were hesitant to use because of the crappy service. \n\nWhen we did use the coupon, the next order was ok although the pizza was definitely nothing to brag about. \n\nThe second issue that we had was when we ordered online again and had no pizza 2 hours later. We called the store and cancelled the order. Then we drove and got some Chinese food. Upon returning from getting Chinese food, a Dominos driver pulled up to our house (a total of almost 3 hours after we had ordered.) Needless to say, after our 2 bad experiences, we'll never order food from Dominos Pizza again.
3;First the great review. My second visit here and this one the food was awesome. We had chips and guacamole which was tasty and well made.\nWe had shrimp tacos and yucatan pork tacos both on corn. The shrimp had a nice smoky flavor with some heat and fruit flavor, the pork tacos were cooked well and I could have eaten them all day.  But the tacos are small and loaded with taste so you leave feeling sated by taste but not in pain form over eating.\n\nNow the bad. As we sat on the balcony a large loud group of hotel media people crowded onto the balcony all around our table talking about lining up shots and ignoring all the customers. Not a warning from the restaurant management or apology from the rude camera crew and snotty on camera people. \nFood - 100\nManagement for allowing Thai circus -zero
4;We've been to this location three times and have always had a positive experience.  The staff is very friendly, knowledgeable, and patient.  The gelato is awesome and the place has always been clean, which I particularly appreciate.  I also appreciate that they allow you to sample as many flavors as necessary to help you make your decision.
4;Very, very nice atmosphere.  Worth the drive from S. Phx to head west for really nice people to take such good care of me and make me feel like a pampered VIP.
3;One of my favorite bars in Vegas. Such an awesome concept with the old school classic board games such as rockem sockem robots, and jenga! Oh yea and the Wii upstairs, so fun!. Love the black and white decor and the upstairs overlooks the bar. Very cool. The prices aren't bad and they serve Illy coffee, my favorite!\nIts usually pretty busy on weekends so i would suggest showing up early to grab a table or the upstairs part for the fun games.\nDef a fun bar to check out when your in the Green Valley area. Ive never tried the food but it always looks delish.
3;Pretty good place over all.  Husband had the nachos and I had the asada torta.  Only suggestion is please clean up the place a little.  The outside of the trash receptacle was disgusting.  I didn't even want to touch it to throw away my trash.  Looked like it has never been cleaned.
0;Its really not recommended to go there. But if you're desperate for o'clock in the morning to place to eat at Aria.. Its just like like ani hop or a Waffle House..\n\nWhen there for lunch, 15 minutes to get water.. I asked the manager for help, did not do much. Another 20 minutes for the food to arrive, so spent practically 40 minutes to get water and food. The food quality is awful, terrible, poor, and disgusting..\n\nI ordered a lemon chicken and chicken fried rice.. The lemon chicken arrived with the chicken cold and Christy on the outside, Anna gelatin like material surrounding it.. Chicken fried rice was not edible at all,... When the menu set at chicken for more dollars literally that's what they do they just add chicken. It doesn't seem like the chicken was cooked with the rice or vice a versa. Chicken was cold and chewy and very dry, the vegetables definitely from a can.. So all together the meal is not worth it, the service was definitely not right the only good thing about the place that it is in Aria hotel which brings in a lot of customers, but I suspect  don't come back
4;We were in Vegas for vacation and looking for something out of the norm to do, and came across Trapeze Las Vegas. I was nervously excited to go but could not be happier with my time there. The staff is really friendly, welcoming and encouraging. The instructors do a great job of actually teaching you the proper technique and showing you your video replay to help you improve. It is a little ways off the strip, about $15-20 cab each way, it is well worth the cab fare, I would highly recommend and hope to return on my next trip to Vegas!
4;Cute little place i just found by my house, great food and the coffee was ok.
3;Stopped in to get my pupusas fix. I got the combo of 3 pupusas with rice and beans for $7.95. They had about 10 different pupusas to choose from. I chose: revuelta (cheese, beans & chicharron), steak and cheese and a pork and cheese. I ordered mines to go, and it took a while. Definitely not a place if you're in hurry. I had to wait at least 15 minutes but that's understandable, pupusas usually takes a while to cook. \n\nThe pupusas were pretty large. Honestly I made 3 seperate meals out of this one combo. They are served with salvadorean slaw and curtido (a red salsa). The slaw here is fresh and crunchy. It's tasty and great with the pupusas. It also had a distinct oregano flavor that I haven't tasted in other slaws. My favorite of the 3 was the revuelta. The three ingredient filling worked really well together. The sides were good, as well. The rice was nice and fluffy and the beans were pretty awesome. It was a little thinner in consistency than normal refried beans but the flavor was pretty damn good. Maybe thats what made the revuelta pupusa my favorite of the 3, the awesome beans they use.\n\nThis restaurant would probably rank 3 stars on my pupusas radar but giving the limited el salvadorean restaurants in Phx, it makes it 4 stars.\n\n*If you never had a pupusas I'd probably describe it as a stuffed sope that's crisp up on both sides like a quesadilla.
4;This place is super yummy. It kinda looks like a dive from the front, but it is really good. Their breakfast is so dang good... if you are going for dinner, I would recommend the Linguine Princepessa. It is fabuloso! Their bread is amazing, but the service... its either hit or miss. Seems to be a fave place for the locals!
4;Great food as usual, their dipping sauces are some of the best, all with unique flavors that please the palette. Service was excellent and our server Aldo was outstanding. I would highly recommend Sala Thai.
4;What a wonderful evening to start out with happy hour and mike I or ( my guy ) excellent food from grilled shrimp to creme burlee fun friend, tequila ... Had a great time mike was on top of it at least we were one of few customers on the patio .
2;Nice Resort steakhouse. Food is good. I wouldn't rate this say on a Mastro's level although it seemed to be our waiter was trying to make us think we were there, but in general the place is just ok.
0;Horrible company, don't waste your time. Amateur employees and management that doesn't know how to schedule.... Glenn the GM is a joke to talk to.... Worst investment I have ever made... Oh and all the good comments are from people that work there.. Not one good comment is from an actual customer.... Seriously
3;Where's the beef?\n\nI've been eating Capriottis for years, when the only store was on Sahara.  My two faves are the mushroom cheesesteak and the meatball with provolone.  \n\nOn my last two visits, I was disappointed to find far less meat than I had been accustomed to.  Cost cutting?  Bad economy?  Oversight?  I'm knocking a star off for that.  Whatever the reason, the sandwiches were still tasty as ever.  Hopefully they won't skimp next time.
4;"Mmmmmm Mmmmmmmm good.\n\nI read about Lotus of Siam on Yelp before we went and had noted some of the favourite dishes.  We ordered the CRISPY DUCK with PANANG - Crispy duck topped with Thai style red cream curry sauce with cognac. - 20.95 (under \""Chefs Choice\"") and drunken noodle with sea bass which the table beside us was enjoying.  \n\nWe also ordered a spicy rice dish and it was SPICY!!!  The food was incredible and even the wine recommendation was great.  Their wine selection is extensive but I think the wine is really kept in a cellar - our red wine was very very cool.  It was not a cheap meal for Thai food but was a great price for an incredible meal.\n\nThe place does look sketchy from the outside and is apparently not in a great neighbourhood but it was $15 in a cab from The Wynn.  We asked them to call a cab for us when we were ready to leave so we didn't have to wait outside.  \n\nI would definitely recommend Lotus of Siam.  Bring your friends, try something different, maybe even something a bit spicy.  You won't regret it.  And if you have tried Thai food before you will not be disappointed - I promise."
4;55 degrees is one of the best wine shops I have ever visited.  Great selection, fantastic service and knowledgeable people working there.  \n\nFYI ... 55 degrees comes from the optimum temperature to chill wine to (55 degrees Fahrenheit).
4;Lets make this simple....the breakfast type food was excellent!   The hash browns is the best I have ever eatten and the breakfast burrito....the bomb!  Sure beats Denny's or IHOP!
2;Not my favorite yogurt place in Charlotte, but a solid addition. They have more variety of flavors than some other yogurt shops, and more toppings, too. Unlike other fro-yo shops, the flavors and toppings tend more toward the dessert side of things, so if you're looking for a lower-sugar indulgence, this may not be the place.
4;After a few nights of 4 AM, post-drinking room service meals, my boyfriend and I decided we wanted to go somewhere good for dinner. We chose Mon Ami Gabi and we were sooooo glad we did! We had reservations on a Tuesday night at 10. We were seated right away in the front room and had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains. \n\nOur waitress was great and gave us some great suggestions.  For appetizers, we had pate, escargot and scallops. All three were amazing. Escargot has always been a little scary to me, but I sucked it up and tried one and it was SO delicious. The scallops were perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. I'm not a huge fan of pate but I had a little and I had to admit it was pretty tasty. For entrees we both had filets-- merlot for me, Roquefort for him. Mine was awesome. Perfectly cooked and drenched in butter and a red wine reduction--how can you go wrong with that??? The filet Roquefort was also good but I'd definitely pick the filet merlot again. The frites were more like potato chips than I was expecting but I enjoyed them nonetheless. After all that food, we were pretty stuffed but the butterscotch pot de creme was screaming our names, so we gave in and ordered it. I think that might be my new favorite dessert. It was rich but not too heavy, like butterscotch pudding only a gajillion times better. \n\nThe prices are very reasonable, especially for what you get. It was very busy the night we were there (and I'm assuming it's like that pretty much every night) but our food still came out very quickly. Other than feeling like elephants when we were done, it was one of the best meals either of us has had in a long time and definitely the best one we had in Vegas!
3;We discovered this place on our last day of boating on Lake Mead.  It did look closed & deserted. But we persisted. We loved the ambience, and the food was the best we had during our trip.  Our waiter was John and he was very gracious and attentive.  Hope this place is still there when we go back.
0;These people will give credit to anyone, EVEN YOUR EX!  They never do their due-diligence to ask if this is your EX's account or not.  When your double-crossing EX stops paying his bill, they come after you like vultures.  It's been a nightmare to straighten them out.  Won't listen, they just want their money.  Will need the courts to get involved in this fiasco.
1;Although Yogis are found around the valley the first one I went to was the one in Phone on Camelback road and 16th street. \nThe one on Happy Valley is ok but I wasn't impressed. As a comparison to the one in Phoenix on Camelback I have to say that this one is not as generous with their portions. I think they should be equally as good but did not feel that way. I though this may have been a one off but I returned a second time and they were consistent with their same portions which did not compare to the one on Camelback. I was disappointed with the portion size and the quality of the chicken which I found to be cold and a not dry. I had the chicken teriyaki bowl and ordered the large one at that. \nI will keep going to the one on Camelback.
4;If you want THE BEST BURGER in town, look no further.  A very cool burger joint...
0;This restaurant kicked out a veteran Pittsburgh Police Officer because an employee noticed he may have been carrying a concealed firearm. This is absurd I will tell everyone I possibly can not to spend a dime is this restaurant.
4;Coca Cafe is my favorite brunch at Pittsburgh!\nThe special menu for Sunday brunch is worthy to try.\nI will suggest my friends try savory meals, because it's really awesome!
0;1st, don't open at 6, open at 7:00\nI waited to buy a fresh baked scone, 7:10, not one item available for sale, \n3 people working, had a rack blocking the entrance, said the baker was late. \nSeem more interested in lunch and opening until 11:00pm than in providing bakery items.
0;We live in the neighborhood near Gus's and we like to support local businesses. When we first started ordering food from them it was pretty darn good. We thought we finally had a good place in our neighborhood that delivered. A few months later and we will never order from them again. Tonight we got a pizza that was just disgusting. The dough was mushy and the pizza was cold. We opened it as soon as it got here and it was cold and gross. We live, no kidding, a quarter mile from them and the pizza was COLD!!! This isn't our first time with getting bad food from them though. We have ordered different sandwiches and one day it will be great and the next time it will be terrible. There is absolutely no consistency and you seriously never know what you are going to get. We have ordered sandwiches one night and the next time we order it, it doesn't even look like the same sandwich. We're done with this place.
0;This is my third attempt to get services set up.  I received a referral through another utility.  Granted, it will save me about $100/month over my current provider but I am beginning to think it's not worth it.  Each time I am told my services and install date have been set only to be told by the next person it has not happened.  Of course each new person can not tell me why I was told it was done.
4;It was my 2 year wedding anniversary and I picked Koi and certainly it didn't disappoint at all. They were really on it with confirming the reservation a day before and left me feeling valued and looking forward to spending money there.\n\nWe arrived early and they came to get us when the restaurant opened which was great service as well. It certainly seems more personal then a buzzer like I get back home. Ha-ha!\n\nOur waiter Eduardo (I believe was his name) was by far the best I have experienced in quite some time dining out and really created an enjoyable mood for myself and my wife. He took time to explain the menu, give recommendations, and even attempted to teach my wife how to learn to use chopsticks. Also he even took it upon himself to give us a free mochi desert at the end of the meal as a courtesy to picking up on it being our anniversary dinner.\n\nBetween us we had the baked lobster, roll, dragon roll, shrimp tempura, and some tiger roll for Japan relief. The fact they had a themed menu to have proceeds to go to Japan relief was another sign that the care was there. \n\nWe also indulged in $4 sake (TWICE) which was infused with fruit and that certainly was out of this world. It literally washed down easily because it tasted like a fruit cocktail. Was a refreshing toast to a very good cause for sure!\n\nThe baked lobster was the best I have ever had and I tend to order that everywhere here in California. With most I get very little lobster and Koi had very generous portions (actually TASTED what I was paying for), what a concept! \n\nWhenever I'm in Vegas and want some great sushi and excellent customer service I certainly will not hesitate to hit up Koi time and time again!
4;It's hard to find words to describe the food & sushi of Antonio Park: SUBLIME, GORGEOUS, DIVINE all come to mind. It's very expensive at dinner (worth every penny) but lunch is way more affordable and no less incredible, try the bim bop!\nTreat yourself to Omakase dinner selected by Park himself and you'll be talking about this place for weeks.
2;"After hearing such amazing rants and reviews about how utterly amazing this place was, I finally took a stab at it. I don't know what it is about expectations, but when the bar is set above and beyond reach, expectations transcend into a delusional dream; a state of nirvana that's almost unreachable and rarely lived up to. For me personally, it sets off a trigger that causes me to excessively critical. I think Megan C put it best, I should have gone in with zero expectations. \n\nThe burgers are eclectic and designed with ingenuity. They're made with high quality ingredients and a good list of add-ons are also offered. For a noob, deciding on the right burger was a pretty daunting task. They all sounded incredibly tasty, but I ended up opting for the bacon cheeseburger on 'Roids. Choosing a complimenting beer was just as hard, but in the end, I ended up shaking hands with Rogue's ever so familiar Dead Guy. \n\nBeing it was my first visit, no subs; I wanted to try the burger exactly as they intended. This bad boy is huge. The patty was good, great quality and cooked to order (medium), but a tad too cold in the center. Bacon: good bacon, but with the sprinkling of bacon salt, the overall burger became too salty and I had to pick out some bacon bits. \n\nLayering: The order in which the ingredients are stacked makes a big difference and is of the utmost importance. The bottom ingredient is the first thing you taste, the first thing to tickle the taste buds. I prefer the cheese on bottom, and in this case, the veggies were on the bottom. Double tomato, pickles, lettuce etc. Bad idea, 'cause all it did was make the bottom bun soggy. With a massively messy burger of this magnitude, I had trouble keeping it all together. \n\nThe lil' lady had the western burger and I took liberty in sampling it, of course. Actually, more like gorging. While it was also good, I can't really say it was memorable. Sweet potato fries are good, but same consensus - nothing memorable and nothing you can't get anywhere else. The chips though, I really liked. Much more crispier than other places. \n\nOverall, while my burger was good, I think the price tag it came with was more memorable than the actual burger itself. I won't write it off though, I actually do like Big Daddy's. I also appreciate and respect what they're doing. It's a pretty hip spot that I would frequent and show off to others. I think I'll just need to give them a few more attempts to satisfy my uberly critical palate before the stars start shining. Hey, we're all critics in our own rights, right? =)"
4;Wow!!! What an awesome place. Service and food are incredible!! \nBest BBQ chicken and ribs I've had!! Sides were great too. Can't wait to go back to Vegas!!
2;Pas impressionn\u00e9e par le service et la nourriture. J'ai choisi un plat de riz sauce vierge, assez simple \u00e0 faire mais manque de go\u00fbt et le texture laisse \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer. Point positif, le concept avec la librairie adjacente est tr\u00e8s original et pour Cotes des Neiges, une belle place ou arr\u00eater.
4;Fantastic venue! Provides members with opulence and importance and staff knows what I want as soon as I walk through the door. The rich history of this Country Club and its members complements the past and future of the best Phoenix has to offer.\n\nEverything is perfect, all the grills, bars, fine dining, golf, swimming,tennis, and the events that are offered to members are top notch!
1;"It's my first time here and the only thing I was impressed about what that the establishment is located in an old gas station. \n\nThe people working here are not too personable when talking with customers. I understand they might get tired of doing that for 5 hours, but if their friends come in leaning and hanging out on the counter while talking to the employees for half hour or more. Then it's time to get re-train some of these workers to be more customer oriented because they're losing focus. They're talking loud on the phone while on shift - pretty much everyone in the place could hear her business.\n\nThe coffee was \""ok\"" nothing too special - I like that bitter/sweet taste in my drink, but that wasn't present. \n\nThe custom art on the walls are neat and makes the atmosphere of the place more welcoming, but there's a disconnect between that and the worker's attitude. I wouldn't mind coming back to this place and giving them another try... I'll re-review until then."
0;Went there yesterday for their Seafood Feast which includes a lobster tail.  With all the food I asked for a box to take the xtra home.  Had not yet eaten all of the lobster.  When I scooped it into the box it smelled kind of fishy.  When I opened it up today, the odor almost bowled me over. I showed it  to my neighbor who is from the coast and eats a lot of seafood.  She said it was definitely off, not just fishy. I was going to save it to take it back to them, but it stunk up my fridge so bad I just threw it away.  My advice, IF you go and anything has even a slightly fishy smell, send it back. YUCK!!!
2;All I can say about this place is that its OK..there didn't seem to be anything about this place to make me want to come back. The food was alright but not big enough..pretty much the only thing I like about it is that its open 24/7
4;Loved the setting, the ambiance was inviting and the staff was great. Excellent coffee and cappuccino. The croissant was very good. The bagel with cream cheese was delicious ...
2;After coming back from a couple dry days of hiking in the havasu indian reservation, their happy hour came to rescue! \n\nWe loved the cute decor and neighbourhood this place is in, the service was good. \n\nOur friend took us here for early dinner, which happened to coincide with their happy hour offering, a buck for an arancini, polenta fries, gnocchi....all my faves...but other than the polenta fries, those dishes aren't much flavours....the house wines on the happy hour menu def good, either that, or we were just too dehydrated... :P\n\npizzas were good here, the thin dough was tasty...but maybe i am used to the Chicago's heavier flavouring on the thin crusts, i found their pizzas on the bland side..the sausages toppings are good though...\n\nAll in all, we still had a good fun time here.
2;"To be clear: the movie I saw was half filled with patrons. With that said--Love the theater but the service was awful. The building and the decor are gorgeous; Immaculately clean and no old popcorn smell. The premium plus seating was so inviting and comfy it makes you feel like you were at home( recliner, blanket and pillow).   That's pretty much where the wow factor ends for me. The \""complimentary\"" popcorn was cold and tasteless but that was expected. The waiters took really long to even acknowledge us although people who entered after were treated with all sorts of pomp and circumstance. When we finally got the waiter's attention the guy did not get my order correct ( or the kitchen decided medium is the same as a well done steak) and took half the movie to bring a single glass of wine. I felt completely ignored and disregarded at the end. For what they charge, I expected better service to go with such a nice environment. My advice: order before and take your food /drink in; those waiters will just let you down."
4;Freakin loved this place. I've been living in Vegas for about three years now, and when I first heard about this place about a year ago I knew I had to go. Anyway, I finally got to go two weeks ago to celebrate my 24th birthday. The ribs are wonderful, and you can choose from three different sauces to put on your ribs: Old Fashioned Barbeque, Memphis Barbeque, and a spicy barbeque sauce. The biscuits were soft, warm, and the cinnamon butter was an added bonus. The service was friendly and attentive. The day I went which was a Saturday, their was a live band playing the blues. In order to be fair, I do highly recommend this estabilishment, but be prepared to have up to a 90 minute wait, and Lucille's does not take reservations.
2;So I've been to three of these (downtown Phoenix, Scottsdale and this one in Tempe).  It's basically Irish Hooters without the pantyhose.  The food is decent, if you're there get the Irish nachos because they're always a hit (fresh potato chips + ground sausage / cheese sauce / fresh tomatoes).  I just feel like here, more so than any Hooters or Twin Peaks I've been to, the girls aren't particularly friendly or attentive.  Of course there are exceptions to the rule, but let's just be honest - most of the time when a group decides to come here it's for the scenery.  Flirty and friendly behavior will almost always equal bigger tips - but I feel like here more than the other boobie themed joints the girls / management don't get that concept.  If you're here for a sporting event, you can get a giant tower of beer that they bring to the table and that's actually pretty cool.  I suppose what I am saying is, I don't like it when places half ass their concept.  If you're going to have scantily clad ladies serving food and drink, they should make an effort to entice you to come back - rather than remind you that they're all aware how attractive and unattainable they are.
2;Spending Mother's Day in Vegas, and being one of those weirdos who'd rather be face deep in my sketchbook than in the casinos or some booby bar, I was relieved to find an art supply store which was just as loaded as the mom n' pop I patronize on my home turf.  Actually, in some ways, I found myself jealous.  These guys stock some gear here that my primary art store stopped selling and want me to special order.  NeeHaw.  The strike though is in the markups.  I know for a fact at my other store, I could've gotten the same gear for roughly $12 less.  I've been shopping there that much.  I think the NV sales tax might have been the primary influence on that score though.
4;"Three or more months I've wanted to go here. Now I wish I hadn't because all other more conveniently located(for me) ice cream shops will never do it for me again.\n\nI was having a hard enough time choosing a flavor when I noticed there was an additional case of flavors on the other side of the counter. How the heck was I going to choose without trying everything? For some reason I always feel guilty trying samples at these types of places.\n\nI felt rushed and it had nothing to do with the great staff. Had to do with the 5+ person line that stayed constant the entire time we were at the parlor. I could feel them breathing down the back of my neck waiting for their fix.\n\nI tried:\nAvocado Jalapeno:\nSweet rich creamy avocado flavor. I've now tried this in ice cream and gellato form and I gotta say its an amazing flavor. At first I was disappointed because all I had was a sweet/fat/avocado flavor but then at the very last minute I caught the spice and very green/chlorophyll flavor from the jalapeno. In hindsight this was probably a bad choice for my first taste since its a stronger flavor. Think I fried the taste buds.\n\nHoney Lavender:\nHad I tried this first I probably would have enjoyed it more. I got the sweetness from the honey but the lavender was lost on me. Probably due to the avocado/jalapeno I tried before.\n\nIrish Cream + Jameson:\nBy this point I was so lost as to what I actually wanted I went with the standby of asking the lady at the counter what her favor was. Expecting her to tell me everything she said nope.. avocado/jalapeno and \""Irish Cream/Jameson\"" now the flavor tag only said Irish cream. My brain was trying to crunch what irish car bomb ice cream would be like. It was delicious caught both flavors and neither was overpowering.\n\nThey had peanut butter and coconut which would normally be what I would get but I felt I already stole enough counter time and went with the avocado/jalapeno and Irish cream/Jameson. Of course now I remember seeing a chocolate/Guinness which would have been perfect with the irish cream/Jameson that really would have been an ice cream irish car bomb. Next time!\n\nI knew they had bacon brittle and there was no way I wasn't getting a bag of that. I would recommend eating this last because again its very strong and I think overpowered the taste buds and the rest of the ice cream lost some of its flavors after that. If your smart just have your ice cream BEFORE you even get the bacon brittle because there's no way you wont tare into it if its in your hands. I don't even think I made it to the register before I was into my bag.\n\nThis stuff was amazing. Large chunks of smokey bacon in perfectly caramelized sugar. Thank god for this new bacon craze because it really does make everything better.\n\nLocally sourced all natural ingredients. Everything made in house from the brownie toppings to the whipped cream.Thanks a lot sweet republic.. you ruined all other ice cream for me. *shakes his fist*"
1;"What can I say? Just not impressed. For all the hype I've heard about this place and numerous good reviews I was just disappointed. \n\nLet me start with the good. I went here for a friend's birthday dinner. My friend and I showed up early before the rest of our group. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks. Here's the good: our bartender was incredibly attentive and funny. My friend doesn't drink much so he gave her a hard time (but it was all in good fun). He was very inquisitive about our tastes in alcohol, and eventually he made me a very tasty cocktail which I enjoyed. He also made some shots for myself and my friend (didn't charge us, very nice of him!). I also asked him to make a drink that was \""purple\"". Based on the fact that my friend who was having the birthday's favorite color is indeed, purple. He obliged. So basically the two stars in this review is all for that particular bartender. Wish I remembered his name.\n\nLet's get on to the BAD. This place is supposed to be Americanized Tapas I guess. When we were sat for our party the waiter took awhile to come around. He took drink orders, but then took FOREVER to come back to take our food order. Also, there was a hub-bub about the all you can eat special. Some people at our table wanted to do the all you can eat, and some did not. The waiter refused to let us do that. RIDICULOUS. Just because my friend wants to do all-you-can-eat and I do not does not mean you should refuse someone. They acted like we were going to take off the plates of the other people who were having all-you-can-eat. We even explained that we were locals, and we felt it was kinda unfair treatment. We all ended up just ordering without the all you can eat.\n\nI had the fish tacos which were bland and boring. They came with shredded lettuce and a small bit of pico de gallo. Nothing else, not even a hot sauce or sour cream. I also had the PB&J which I felt was okay, but nothing to rave over. I think the best thing there was the bread they offered before we got our meals.\n\nIf you want tapas in Las Vegas go to Firefly. At lest you'll get REAL tapas with decent portions, and you won't be made to follow their silly rules, which I think are probably made up there because they know tourists will abide and probably just decide that everyone will do the AYCE, even if someone in the party doesn't want to.\n\nIf you're looking for good cocktails and you'd like to see a bit of a show (they do flare) than JS may be good, but go somewhere else for tapas!! You will be happy you did."
2;If you looking to remember college days gone by or still here, I suppose this is the spot, pools overcrowded, but collegiate atmosphere, non smoking but everyone smoking on patios, cigar and cigarettes- pet friendly? Long hallways - set up in a square design. Free coffee and free wifi if you sign up for the Kimpton rewards ( free) , showing signs of wear for a seven year old resort. Overall, it's adequate for loud parties, want to relive college days - special rates if you search, restaurant pricey - though many choices for less a short ride or shuttle away. I was just at Amara -Sedona - and this place will give you culture shock after that. I suppose Kimpton has an eclectic collection.
1;I dont know if it's because I'm from philly and things are made different or what but I dont like the pizza. My husband loves it because the sauce is sweet. I've given them chances and even tried the calazone. In philly they are made with cheeses, sauce on the side, with anything in the inside.  Here they make it like a sandwich with butter melted. Just messy to me. Its hard to find a good pizza.
3;"I visited Lisa G's some weeks ago with a couple of cool chicks. I was excited to finally be going to have dinner there as I had heard so much about the place, I had been dying to try it myself. We arrived to Lisa's \""house\"" and I was surprised at the simple but elegant decor. We waved a hello to Lisa who was behind the bar and were greeted by our waitress. Ah.. our waitress. I usually like to engage whomever is serving us and get their thoughts on food and wine. Our waitress seemed disinterested in any of that. In fact when we asked what a certain red table wine was a blend of she just replied \""I don't know.\"" She should have said \""Let me go find out.\"" Oh well, minor detail, but that stuff irritates me. \nWe perused the simple and small menu. OF COURSE I had to have a bowl of balls! Oh my gosh... the balls...were just....so tasty! The dish came covered with PLENTY of sauce on top, a slice of bread, and a slice of parm that just crumbled over the balls. Want to make me wag my imaginary tail? Make a simple dish, but make it VERY well. I was delighted that such a seemingly simple dish such as the bowl of balls brought so much flavor to the table with good quality ingredients. The fantastic food made me forget out lackluster waitress. That's key! \n\nI will definitely be back to Lisa G's to try her other dishes....or maybe just have another bowl of balls!"
1;Don't go for breakfast. Everything was bland. The line was too long for the ONE omelet bar and the muffins were from costco I think.\nMaybe lunch and dinner are better. Also, the holograms are way creepy.
4;Amazing as usual , just picked up a dozen rellenos for Christmas !!! Love this place !
0;"07/09/2008  \nJust went there last week for the first, and last, time.  I read the good reviews, so I was expecting much more.  I am a first generation American; both my parents were German and came over in their 20's.  I lived there for a few years, have eaten German food all my life, and have been to many German restaurants in many different states over the years.  I really wanted to like this place, as there are not many German establishments around here, but this place was terrible!  We were the only people in the place at 2pm, and still had horrible service.  ???  We were ignored much of the time and then when the waitress did come, she would forget things we had asked her for.  The waitress didn't understand German, as in the German MENU options, so I ordered from the menu using the English translations, and she was still confused. I had to POINT at the options.  YES, there really is CUCUMBER salad on the menu.  The bread was stale, the schnitzel was hard, there was a hair in my cucumber salad and my potato pancakes were just ...disgusting.  They also gave me fries instead of the usual sides????  I am guessing that they just reheated leftovers from the dinner the night before, because that is exactly what it tasted like.  Plus, I actually got charged the wrong prices - like lunch salad was 3.50, but showed up on my bill as 5.00, etc.  I was too frustrated to even bring it up and just left, disappointed.  Waste of time and money, I will not return.  Maybe at dinner time things are better, but DO NOT EVEN TRY THE LUNCH!  Yuck.\nOh, and the website is outdated- wrong prices and discontinued menu items."
3;I stopped in Harvey's American House on Saturday while my wife was shopping across the street at Koles.  As soon as I sat down a very energetic young lady sticks out her hand and asked my name.  Her name is Fianna, enthusiasm and great outgoing personality is a great asset to the owner of this place a lot of beers on hand, no Guiness to my surprise had Murphy's Stout.  Food looked appetizing and can't wait to go back for a meal. I hope Fianna will be working, she lights the place up.
0;"Changing one's name does not change the fact that the establishment still exists. I've experienced the WORST service with \""The Sushi Room\"" now Rock Lobster. I purchased a Groupon a few months back to eat sushi with my daughter and that is where the horrible service saga began.\n\nMaking reservations is an absolute joke! When I first purchased the Groupon, we made the reservation as required in the fine print. We arrived 15 mins early and sat outside. 15 mins later our drink orders were taken. Another 10, the drinks arrive and we order. We sat outside for 45 mins with NO food and no real service. The restaurant was NOT crowded! When I requested to cancel the order and pay for the drink I drank, I was told my food was almost ready. Not quite, I'm leaving! We were offered the food for free, but by this time I was quite upset because I was hungry and irritated. Stuck with the Groupon, I was forced to use it before it expired. Thanks for nothing Chase Bank!\n\nToday, I had my mother call and make a reservation for 5:30 pm and she was told they only had a 5:45 pm open. Upon arrival at 5:35 pm we were told that we had no reservation. Hmmm. Really?! Why is this the same girl who provided no service the last visit? And why does the sign on the wall state that Teppan ressy's start at 5 pm? Could the night get any worse? Hmmm, let's see:\n\n- With the addition of the Teppan, the waitress should ask whether or not a guest wants a regular or Teppan seat. Don't automatically walk me to a tray table (too small for 2 people). I made a reservation for the Teppan table that apparently NEVER made it to the book\n- You have happy hour, but I could only get HH drinks at the Teppanyaki table. Suggestion: Make a special \""Teppan HH Menu\"". This might serve your business well\n- No real Vodka or decent beer options; at least not for me. Absolute Vodka and Bud Light are low budget. Step up your game\n- While it is restaurant week, I had to request the RW menu. No bueno\n- We were told we could sit anywhere at the Teppan table however, should more people arrive we'd have to move down. Great! Right when my a$$ has warmed the seat. Though Benihana's has gone downhill, this place could learn something. Seat people correctly the first time. I'M NOT GETTING UP ONCE I'M COMFORTABLE!\n\nNOTE: I actually saw her ask a family with a disabled child to move once others arrived. Rude and unprofessional. The family was there first and shouldn't have been asked to move. If anything, the incoming family of six should've been sat at the Teppan table in the back.\n\n- The waitress barely came to inquire if we were ok or if we needed anything. And being the nice person I am, still left a tip. Shame on me.\n- And last but not least, when I showed her the Groupon she went to touch my phone. (Excuse me! You're in my personal space and attempting to touch my personal property! No bueno!) I will mark the Groupon as redeemed. Don't ever touch a customer's phone. \n\nBUYER BEWARE! NEW NAME SAME OWNERS (APPARENTLY) AND SAME WAITRESSES, WHICH IS HARD TO TELL WITHOUT THE CHANGE IN SERVER ATTIRE (FROM BOOTY SHORTS TO BLACK PANTS AND A BLACK UNIFORM T-SHIRT)....THE ONLY THING THIS PLACE DID RIGHT. NEVER AGAIN!"
0;The decor is contempory Mexican and it was packed when my wife and I got there just before the end of Happy Hour.  Ordered 2 Chile Rellinos on a dinner serving, a Chicken enchilladsa, and a green chile burro.  After a LONG wait, one a la carte chile rellino arrived with some chicken tostados andno burro.  The server disappeared and after 5 minutes came back and noticed we weren't eating our meal...and we told him they had delivered  the wrong things.  He check his order and took them away.  About 10 minutes later the correct things arrived.  While the portions are generous...the food is VERY BLAND.  Probably the worst Mexican food I've ever had.  Oh...the salsa and chips before the meal were good and the small older busboy was very hard working and pleasant.  There are many places better than this place.  Very disappointing.
0;"I've never seen my girlfriend as angry as she was upon leaving the office of Dr. Leo Biglaiser. We arrived to no office staff other than the doctor himself who asked her name 6 times prior to the exam. His equipment was antiquated and his process slower than kicking a bowling ball up a sand dune.\n\nThe worst of it was, when it came to getting the prescription, he began to ask what frames she wanted and she politely requested to just have the prescription. She said she would purchase frames online. He became irate, raised his voice and began asking why she would do that and argued with her about the decision. After half an hour of her repeating her request and him making comments like, \""I'm not calling you an idiot or anything...\"" and \""well, how do you know they'll get the right lenses?\"" she finally threatened to walk out if he didn't write the prescription and let her leave. He finally did after a few more of his rude quips.\n\nThe prescription went right into the garbage. His equipment was so poor, she was afraid to trust it. Dr. Biglaiser was incredibly rude and provided atrocious customer service. I would recommend Edward Scissorhands as an optometrist over this doctor."
2;"You had better like meat to truly enjoy Via Brasil.  The atmosphere is lovely and the staff is quite attentive (more on this later).  If you are not familar with the concept these brazilian steakhouses are an all you eat motif with a salad bar and then meats on long skewers are brought to the table and you can have as much of them as you desire.\n\nMost of the meats were hot (not all) and flavorful.  There was prime rib, steak, chicken, sausage and some I am probably forgetting.  They also include in the price all of the side dishes you want, served in a family style fashion, meaning enough for the whole table.  The sides were OK but not that special.\n\nI actually found while the salad bar had many choices along with soup that making an old fashion salad was not an option.  But if the salad bar is your thing you are going here for the wrong reason and paying way too much.\n\nWe were celebrating a 60 year anniversary for my girlfriend's parent and they made us feel special and catered to the 80 year olds well.\n\nMy biggest complaint and one which really lasted with me was that the servers and our waiter while seeming polite were actually rude when it came to interrupting on-going conversations at the table.  None of the servers or the waiters seemed even remotely aware that when they come to the table with questions or food to say \""excuse me\"" or wait until they were noticed and instead they proceeded to talk at us with no regard to what was going on at the table.  In some ways I am betting they see this as being attentive but if the same thing happened any other place it would have been classified as what it was, rude.\n\nIn my opinion and this is what Yelp is all about, the staff was poorly trained in this one area.  They were otherwise quite gracious.\n\nOne last issue and while it was only $7, we had purchased a restaurant.com certificate for $3 which was to cover the first $25 of the bill.  They informed us they were no longer accepting the certificates and offered us a $15 discount. How you can decide to cancel an offer we already paid for is beyond me and they tried to appease us but ended up cheating us out of a few dollars, just not cool.\n\nFor those who love beef and who can afford over $40 for dinner this place is still a great experience and be aware as others have written that unless you want to pay dearly for water be specific and ask for tap water."
0;This is a terrible doctors office. The PA that I saw misdiagnosed me on the first visit. I saw the Dr on the second visit and I was misdiagnosed again. I ended up having to use the internet to figure out what I had. They will not listen to anything you have to say and will jump to their own conclusions even if your health history does not match their diagnostic. Stay away from this place for your own health.
4;I might be too generous considering I've only consumed vodka tonics here, but man! I love this place.\n\nIt's quite simple, really. Starting a Friday or Saturday night off right to me, means coming to Drift for beverages, eye candy, booth dancing, and giggles. \n\nI love the layout. Its very cool and classy. The lighting is just sexy too. Luckily, when I've been here it hasn't been over crowded and there was a live dj who i wanted to give a big fat kiss on the lips. Amazing place to start prior to a night of dancing your ass off in old town Scottsdale.
0;The place has a great atmosphere but don't expect quick service for breakfast. It's almost like the staff have never worked in a restaurant before or could care less about refilling drinks or taking our order. We had to walk up to the server numerous times to ask for refills of our drinks. Such a shame the staff is not customer focused
1;Totally disappointed. \n\nUnless you're making a visit at the weeee hours of the morning after a late night at the bar, and you're taste buds are non existent and you're a.d.d. and don't mind waiting forever for food - this place was just horrible from taste to service. \n\nFYI if you ever order a grilled cheese keep in mind they slap a tomato on it. UGH! I was disgusted. First of all I gag at the sight of tomatoes let alone the taste.Grilled cheese is not on the menu, but I figured when I asked for a grilled cheese it was just that. Bread with grilled cheese. Sorry I to vent but i was livid. I waited 45min for that and had to send it back. \n\ntwo thumbs down
2;Black Pepper: Good riddance! \nXing Asian Bistro has moved in to the old Black Pepper location a The Village at Lake Las Vegas. Xing is a welcome change of pace from the usual dinning fare we have had in the village for 5 years. The price point is a little lower than the other restaurants with most entrees being under $10. They have a nice selection of Saki to choose from. Currently Xing only has a beer and wine license but i am told a full liquor license is on its way, which is good.  I would hate to see that beautiful bar go to waste.\n\nMy only suggestion to Xing would be to get a plate warmer or warmer for the plated food. My friend and I ordered 3 entrees and the Mongolian Beef entree was cold when we got it, which I suspect was because it was plated first and set there until Kung Pao chicken and Orange chicken was ready.\n\nIt was their grand opening so I didn't expect it to be perfect, but I'll be back in a couple weeks to see how things still are.
4;Came for the World Cup insanity, so I don't think I got an accurate representation of what this bar normally is like. The bar girls have outfits that would make Hooters girls blush, and the male waitstaff wear kilts, presumably for easy access with the aforementioned ladies, since creating even a shadow of authenticity to some old-world standard is clearly not the goal here.\n\nThis definitely was the place to watch the game though, and five stars to Tilted Kilt for playing host to the ridiculous, over-the-top passion that the American Outlaws bring to a soccer party. There was a guy with a drum leading chants, lots of bros decked out in whatever spandex they owned in red, white and blue, and a few founding fathers that presumably belong to those with dual memberships in American Outlaws and the Tea Party. Generally I had a jolly good time, and I couldn't ask for a better place to watch the USMNT kick ass.
3;Duck hash, oatmeal and coffee were all good. Not a bad place for some nice brunch.
3;So great! The home style New Mexico chili was awesome on top of the cheese enchiladas.  Definitely going back for more!
2;Monday night I was craving carne asada so I stopped by Eribertos drive thru, since it has been at least a year since I last came here. They really need to fix the lil speaker you order through, I can never understand what they're saying! Any way, I ordered a quesadilla & a #8 for my hubby, which is carne asada tacos w/rice & beans, & myself a carne asada burrito w/rice & beans added inside of it. When I pull up to pay I notice a sign w/all their dessert choices. The tres leche cake looks yummy so I order 1 of those & pay w/cash since I already paid for our dinner w/my card. After I paid, the girl working the window informs me the only dessert they have left is cheesecake. I really don't want it but I already paid so I say it's fine. I am waiting almost 10 minutes for my food, which is a tad annoying, but honestly at least it's fresh. My burrito was good & not too big of a portion like some places. Hubby enjoyed his quesadilla, tacos & rice & beans as well, definitely made 2 meals out of it. The cheesecake was not very good & I only ate about half & tossed the rest. Not sure how soon I will be back b/c they are way overpriced for what it is, I spent over $21!
2;The Buffet at the ARIA is not too shabby. I admit, compared to the numerous buffets in Las Vegas, the Buffet doesn't stand out, however, there are a definitely things that one will love about this buffet.\n\nNow this review was during Saturday Brunch on Valentine's Day/President's Day weekend. The regular brunch price is $29.99 per person but they decided to increase the price to $35.99 due to the holiday weekend. This was sneaky on their part to raise prices just for the weekend, but I realized $5 wasn't a big deal in Vegas (especially when you have a $50 room credit). It's also convenient for those staying at the ARIA. The line was nonexistent at 9:30a but grew after we left. Still, the line was not ridiculously long.\n\nThe Buffet is modern as you would expect walking into the ARIA. There are windows all around so it's quite bright. The d\u00e9cor & furniture also help make the entire restaurant bright. The waiter service was just okay. My orange juice order was forgotten but plates were removed at a reasonable amount of time. I do love that they give you a large pitcher of coffee instead of having to flag the waiter down for a refill.\n\nOverall, they have a good selection of foods. You can find Chinese, Indian, Korean, American, Mexican, Italian, French, and even Filipino food here. Their Asian foods were probably my favorite as they had Filipino longanisa (sausage) and their kimchi fried rice was delicious! They also have a legit tandoori oven to bake the naan. I really appreciate the gluten free options but I did find those dishes to be a bit bland. Most will appreciate that their snow crab legs are already cut in half. Although this saves the mess and time, I definitely feel more satisfied cracking open a crab leg myself. I also think that this dries out the crab meat. Speaking of dry, I found that a lot of their dishes were a bit dry possibly due to overcooking. Their desserts are quite good. I especially loved their revolving gelato machine. Other desserts one should try are their pecan pie and flan.\n\nThe Buffet at the ARIA met my expectation and was decent enough with the room credit. I do wish that some of their dishes were more flavorful and less dry. I don't see myself going out of my way to eat at this particular buffet though.
3;Had the saveur lamb burger, onion rings and a bloody Mary. It was delicious. The bloody Mary was very savory and tasty, definitely unlike any I have ever had.
4;So, yes it's hard to find a bad steak in Vegas, but this place is more than a good steak... It's a phenomenal dining experience with the finest quality foods molded into divine creations with superb drinks and wonderful service. Props to Ashley!  I exclude the attitude of the hostess as her stilettos clearly were shoved too tightly up into her backside. \n\nThe beef is incredibly tender and succulent, the crab and lobster meat are fresh and delicious, the heartiness of the short rib appetizer is overwhelming balanced well with a slightly sweet butternut squash risotto.  You can tailor your meat to perfect your taste including toppings like crab, lobster, foie gras, etc but I loved the jalape\u00f1o onion. Sauces are only $2 but you don't need them, the meat is juicy and delicious on its own. Definitely get the corn pudding as a side. \n\nThe ladies enjoyed many fine cocktails and my friend (total wine snob) and I had four different glasses of wine to complement our meals and tasted about 10 in between. \n\nWe dined early at 6 on a Friday because we had show reservations at 930 and we left just around 845. I definitely recommend eating earlier because its less crowded and then as you're dining and drinking it gets packed with fantastic trendy music. It's on the louder side but definitely not too loud. We had a total blast. \n\nOverall, yea I dropped a $G at this place but the supreme dining experience that my guests and I totally loved made it totally worth it. \n\nYea. Amazeballs!
1;I've been here twice now and both times I experienced a long long long wait. I expected the first visit to have a long wait as they would have to add me as a new patient and communicate with my insurance, but it turns out that my second visit had a SIGNIFICANTLY longer wait. I waited 45 minutes. In the waiting room and then about another 35 minutes waiting to be seen in the room. My primary insurance isn't accepted by them, so I am technically not supposed to have my secondary insurance billed, and I have told the staff this multiple times, yet they still haven't recorded that anywhere. I am supposed to pay as for a cash visit and they still try to charge me only my copy every time, which could cause trouble with my insurance company. The staff isn't organized at all. They couldn't even find the sign in sheet. All of your measurements are written down on sticky notes, which I'm assuming isn't always transferred where intended considering that the woman who was weighing me asked me what my weight was at the time of my last visit. They are friendly for the most part but that's not all it takes to run a doctor's office. The professionalism just isn't there.\n\nDr. Adams herself is awesome, which is the only reason I gave 2 stars. She is a busy doctor with lots of patients but still makes you feel remembered and spends time talking with you until any and all questions have been answered. I intend to continue to see her but it sure would be nice if the staff worked on their organization and professional skills.
0;30 minute wait in a drive thru lane is completely redicolus. There were only 2 cars ahead of us! Way to many taco shops in town to even give this place a 2nd chance
0;Absolutely disgusted by how this place made no attempt on their website or elsewhere besides a piece of paper on the door saying they are closed. Staying on the strip getting a taxi to this place was not cheap expecting it to be open to find it isn't. Service has been horrible on many occasions.
4;Awesome FREE ( well donations accepted) thing to do in Vegas!! Very interesting history!!! Must see!!!!
4;"I love this place!  The owner is as sweet as can be and really great with her customers both human and furry ;)  The groomer is awesome!  I have two Yorkie boys and every time I take them there they come home looking so adorable and most importantly they are not stressed out.  Great store with with really cute items for your fur baby and an amazing groomer!"
0;The first time we ate there was so good. we planned next trip especially to eat there. However, the second time the food was gross. It was so bad we never ate there again. It's true, it depends on the chef. I have little to say about this place, I was disappointed.
1;"Let me say that I like waffles.  Until somewhat recently - namely when I have to make them for the kids - I really prefer them over pancakes by a wide margin.  While you can pull waffles out of the freezer, it is just so much easier (and tastier) to make pancakes from scratch.  Sure, you can make waffles at home, but they are so messy.  And who has time to go to Waffle House every day?  But I digress.\n\nThe waffles at Cast Iron are different from just about any other waffle.  However, to have them, you have to find them, and that is a bit of a challenge.  The address does not help much.  It gets you in the area.  Their directions tell you they are \""across from the bank\"", but in reality, they are in little shop in the base of a townhome (or that is what it looks like) - while all the other businesses are at the other end of the center.  So you are nowhere near where you would think they should be.  Keep that in mind.\n\nShould you actually find the place, you may find yourself disappointed if you go at the wrong time.  While they sell their waffles to go (so you can enjoy them at home later), apparently if you go outside of busy hours, they actually make waffles during this time even for serving at non-busy hours.  So if you are are there at, say, dinner time - a nice, non-busy time where you might want a waffle for a treat - then you are likely to get a previously made, perhaps refrigerated or frozen waffle rather than a freshly prepared one.  Still tasty, but not great.\n\nAnd there is not a ton of selection - not that that is a bad thing.  Waffles and some toppings (which you can customize).  Everything else is drinks.  Just so long as you are not expecting a version of the Belgium House of Waffles or the Waffle House of Belgium, you should be fine.  This is more the Belgium Kiosk of Waffles.  With beverages."
4;How can you not love this place. I'm the kind of person that will rather go buy a carton of ice cream at Fry's over getting my sweet fix at an ice cream shop since you get much more for the same price, but this is the exception.\n\nYou can taste the freshness in the ice cream. It's like driving a Ford Taurus vs a Lamborghini. I always, always get the Birthday Cake ice cream, well except for tonight (it's all good Casey!). Today I got Chocolate Cake (need to stick with the extremely sugary stuff I guess) and Cookies N Cream. Equally amazing. So now I'll have to get 3 scoops every time I go. \n\nThere is a lovely inside where you can sit with friends, draw fun stuff on their chalkboard tables. They also have pints you can take home, they make really good cakes and they also make amazing butter. This is just one of those places where you feel good supporting a local business and you get a great treat in return. Also, the owner Casey is in quite often and very friendly. Today when I went in he was super excited to show off the Superstition Farm's new website. \n\nProtip: Check in with the Yelp app and get your loyalty card punched. I've already gone through 2 and they hook it up with I think $5 worth of free treats when you get enough check-ins and/or hole punches.
2;Soup was good...shrimp salad was good.\nPrice is always more than nearby competitors, but it's a little better suited for business luncheons.\n\nI think they're cutting back on the shrimp count in those salads....maybe trying to increase profit margin a little?\n\nAlways good service and a clean, quality atmosphere.
2;The decor of this Serendipity is nothing like the one in NYC.  When I walked in, I thought I was in a vintage boutique.  I expected to see Jimmy Choo shoes and Machesa dresses on display.  Instead, I saw sandwiches and foot long hot dogs.  It did look pretty good though.\n\nWe stopped for dessert.  My in-laws wanted to try their famous frozen hot chocolate ($8.50).  To me, it tasted like Carnation hot chocolate made with milk.  Throw in some shaved ice, add a mound of whip cream and chocolate shavings...vuala...Alan's famous frozen hot chocolate!  Nothing ground breaking at all.  I like to go back and try the food but considering all the great places to dine in Vegas, I doubt I'll ever go back.
4;"Situated at its original location inside the former Bill's Gamblin' Hall and Saloon.  Just a heads-up, this isn't the same as the rooftop club especially since they have separate means of entry.  This one's underground which can be a little daunting to walk out of afterwards due to the bright sunlight beaming right at you.  \n\nNo line so people are usually chaotically scattered around the entrance.  This is one of those places where actually knowing someone will help you get behind the ropes.  You can, however, get your Benjamins do the talking and get the bouncers' attention.  If you think that'll get you straight through the dance floor, then you're mistaken as everybody, even locals, has to pay for cover charge: $20/ladies and $30/gentlemen.\n\nThis place is usually packed mostly with the crowd from the club upstairs as they desperately survey the dance floor to see who they can persuade to take home for the night.  After that, it gets really weird so make sure you're somewhat inebriated before walking in.  Drinks are actually quite stiff but priced like any others along the strip.  If you need more than liquor to keep the night going, there are usually people going around selling \""illicit substances.\""  With that being said, DO NOT LEAVE YOUR DRINK UNATTENDED as I've seen shady people drop things on random people's booze.\n\nOverall, Drai's After Hours is definitely the best lounge in the valley to keep the party going.  This is a must especially for those visiting Las Vegas for the weekend.  Two different rooms with house in one and hip-hop at the other.  Remember to be safe and enjoy the great ambiance."
3;"I've got to give Oregano's credit, the food was significantly better than I was expecting.  I've long avoided this restaurant as given it's popularity, it is always slammed with customers.   I figured that while the food was probably good, it wasn't THAT good.   We did arrive early (around 4:00 PM) to get our name in the hat and ended up enjoying a two hour wait.  In fairness to Oregano's, we were a party of 13 and they couldn't seat us until at least half the group had arrived.  No one objected to that and in this instance, I didn't mind the wait.   \n\nThe outside staff was courteous and it was nice to get full drink service while we were out there.   Their beers on tap aren't outstanding, though they do have some microbrew stuff as well as the typical range of garbage beers and slightly less garbage beers so at least the liquor was drinkable.  I couldn't get a Bloody Mary though because they were \""out of Bloody Mary Mix\"" (note to self, never order a Bloody Mary at Oregano's).   The free pizza samples were quite nice as well.   \n\nFrom the time we finally did get seated, to getting our food, to paying our bill, was two and half hours so in all our large group ended up spending around 4 1/2 hours at the restaurant with long waits to be seated and a long wait between ordering our food and getting our food.  \n\nWas it worth it? Ahh, the million dollar question.   As I said in the beginning of the review, I was overall pretty surprised by the quality of the food.  It was quite delicious.  I ordered an alfredo dish with shredded chicken and it was very good.  The sauce had a strong flavor without being overwhelming and Oregano's use of southwest peppers wins a gold star from me.   They get a little carried away with the herbs (to much Oregano? yes!) which gives some of the food a gritty aftertaste but overall it was excellent.   \n\nI also decided to order a full-size pizza to take home with me.  After waiting four hours, I figured it wasn't going to be anytime soon that I would venture these crowds again.  The pizza, a southwestern creation with carne asade and more poblanos was also quite good.  I love thin crust pizza so for me they have a real winner here with their basic design.   Again the use of herbs was somewhat overpowering but the taste of the pizza was fairly rock solid.   The larger pizzas are only $1-$2 more expensive than the small pizzas (though the pizzas themselves are fairly expensive overall) so after going with an 18'' I ended up with enough food to get me through the next several days.  I was quite happy about that.\n\nOverall the experience was very positive but it was mainly made so by having a great group of friends to hang with.  Going in we knew the wait was going to be long (especially because of the size of our party) so we took it in stride and tried to enjoy the atmosphere.   The food was definitely good and the service was decent but the food was not good enough that I would be willing to brave the wait times on a regular basis.  I'm fairly sure Oregano's will go on the list of (very) infrequent special occasions.      I strongly recommend you avoid the restaraunt if you are looking for something small or intimate.   \n\nPart of the issue with this location is that they built in an old fast food joint (long-time residents of the area will recognize it as the building that used to house a Fazolli's) and the building simply isn't large enough for the crowds the food draws.  That's a shame because the restaurant easily draws enough business to support a larger building and larger staff.   Oregano's, I love you but either open more West Side locations or relocate to a larger building, until then you won't be seeing me regularly.\n\nThough, with the business they draw, they won't be missing my money either.   Ahh well, at least the food is delicious."
1;Not my favorite.  A friend had seen the food-tv visit and thought it looked interesting.  Although there were some good ideas, the overall impression from three people's food was - salty.  I got a salad with the weird jam-dressing.  Meh.  We got a couple of the mason jars full of stuff, and they were difficult to eat both logistically (hello - iced tea spoon?-deep jars and short spoons make a mess) and in terms of flavor (salt).  The closest to good was the chocolate and icecream mason jar, but it suffered from many logistical problems (hello - cover the outside with chocolate?-what-short spoon with everything covered in chocolate and supposedly layers of stuff in the jar?-what) despite being quite tasty.  The fried mac and cheese appetizer was good, but not better than you get anywhere else.  Don't know that I'll need to go back any time soon.
0;I got the boneless wings which were obviously frozen.  Freaking Terrible!
2;Had classic sweet crepe and the polish tea (which is  black tea with honey and lemon piece) there. Not much seats in there, looks like about 4 or 5 table. Good place for drop by and have some drinks.
2;Pho is fine but the soup is not even close to 'warm'. I would give this place 4 stars if soup would be hotter.
4;Been coming here for 5+ years now. I always have Wendy cut my hair. She is great! I trust her as a hairstylist to do whatever she wants, and she never disappoints. I moved to California almost a year ago, and drove out to Vegas just to get a haircut from her. Friends that I have recommended also only go to her now. I have had my hair highlighted by her as well in the past and it came out great.
0;Not up to LA Fitness standards, or worth your money. I only go here because I live within walking  distance, and I usually regret it.  The facility is old, machines are old, and half the time it's dirty.  And tonight I noticed ants crawling all over the locker room.  \n\nDo yourself a favor, drive to one of the two on camelback.
0;We ate here once and the food was good, but expensive. We got takeout for a special occasion last weekend, and the food was tasteless. We were all disappointed in the entrees we ordered. The Shanghai Noodles, my friend's favorite, were very dry with no sauce, and definitely no spices added.The Kung Pow Chicken and Mandarin Beef literally had no taste and not even soy sauce or salt and pepper would bring them up to par. We all enjoy spicy food and we found only two chiles between the two dishes, that were definitely not hot the way we like or have had at other Chinese restaurants. The only dish that resembled what we expected were the Walnut Prawns. This place is more expensive than any other Chinese takeout we have used over the years, and not worth the extra money--so you don't always get what you pay for. Our bill at Nee House was $54 [and we even tipped $6 bucks] compared to a recent similar order from Bamboo China, which was $34 and excellent! Last time we will order from here.
2;I have been here a few times and I think it is pretty good, it isn't amazing or anything. It is almost like an expensive Olive Garden but a little more classy. They have a cool way of waitering though the waiters and waitresses write their names upside down (upright) to the customers and its great. Anyways, not really the greatest place in town but definitely a nice getaway.
0;"As a consumer should I lower my personal expectations or view of what customer service is? A reoccurring thought I have every time I shop at the local  Walmart. Plagued by filth, incompetence,  lack of customer service,  and friendliness I always hope my experience is better than the last time i was there but unfortunately I'm always disappointed. I was out of shower gel and went to Walmart.com looking for a great deal which i found and printed the coupons from their website. I was excited because I was going to save several dollars due to the coupons which was the only reason I decided on Walmart. Found everything I was looking for despite the rude employee who violated my personal space trying to restock items. She was so close I could have kissed her if I turned my head and never heard excuse me sir so I said it instead. Then during checkout the cashier seemed irritated as soon as I pulled out the coupons I printed. She asked a supervisor close by if they accepted the coupon who replied \""only if they scan\"". Uhmmm they're your coupons off your website,  if they don't work then it's not my fault and you should still give me the discount. She huffed and puffed as she was scanning them and seemed annoyed, then one coupon didn't scan and she said I guess it doesn't work but at least the other ones worked. Yes then others worked but that's not then point - don't offer coupons if you won't accept them. Don't get an attitude or get frustrated when people use coupons because that was the only reason I was at your store in the first place. Remember they were Wal-mart coupons from Wal-Mart.com. They're a fortune 500 company who profits millions every year. Maybe they should spend more money on training because the Customer Service sucks!!!!!!! Their business model sucks : low prices and crappy service doesn't equal more money it equals less customers like me. I work hard for my money and why spend it at places who truly could care less how they treat people. Dear Wal-Mart the only way you'll ever get my money is because other places don't have what I need. I'm done!!!!!!!!"
0;Blond manager has run this place into the ground. They screw up every single time I place an order.
0;"Wow, the staff here is incredibly rude, we arrived and the receptionist was very unfriendly, then the girl that took us back started asking my daughter questions without introducing herself, I had to ask her if she was the doctor.  My daugter was then seen and her father was meeting us there (he was at work, but coming late), but  they would not allow him in the room \""because the Dr. was uncomfortable\"" having more than one person back there...REALLY???  Then they changed their story saying that we were almost done and so they would not let him come back to the room.  He should have been allowed back so that he could hear the doctor's final commments.  AVOID THIS PLACE at all costs.  I would have rather sat in an ER for 2 hours.  At least they are nice and allow fathers to hear their children's diagnosis."
4;Been seeing Chiropractors since before they were allowed to hang their sign up. Dr. Vu is what chiropractic care was meant to be. No lengthy and expensive programs. He was able to treat me one time and take care of the problem without x-rays. I will go back one more time for another look and to thank him. There may be Chiropractors as good in the area, but none better.
1;I've eaten here many times, mainly because we liked the restaurant prior to it becoming the Attic.  I will admit the food is really good, the beers are great, and the decor is my style.  \n\nSo why the two stars then?   \n\nThe biggest problem this place has is customer service.  It is poor, at best.  The two times we have been there the staff were either rude or they ignored their tables.  Very well could have been understaffed but it happened twice.  This is a real shame because the food is excellent and I love the location.  The only thing keeping me from coming back is the poor service I've experienced both times I've been there.
4;I've been ignoring this sushi place coz of the mexican word in its name. Why a sushi place got a mexican name? But I found it in yelp and it got a good reviews. So, I gave it a try. The sushi looks good, I love sushi place that makes presentable looking sushi (it means to me that they hire knowledge sushi maker). Not only the sushi looks good, the sushi are fresh and taste good as well. They have reasonable prices. I would recommend this place.
3;"\""It's was pretty cool! There were gogo dancers!!!\""\n\nmy boyfriend seems to like it."
0;No se merecen ni una estrella. Lastima que tienen a puras viejas vale madre trabajando como meseras. Lo primero que se hace antes de sentar alguien en una mesa, es LIMPIAR la mesa, luego cuando se entregan los menus, se le pregunta al cliente que gustan tomar? De cuando aca este pinche lugar se volvio Las Palmas? No estoy en contra de chirrines, pero se pasan la verdad al dejar a musiquillos traer bocinas.
4;Great food n staff! Good reasonable prices n delicious just like home breakfast food! Best place for brunch/breakfast in Az. I don't even like breakfast food but I luv this place so much that I changed n I luv it now! Best place to eat with friends n fam. Or even alone!
1;just had lunch here today and boy this is a sad excuse for Mexican restaurant.  in fact it really fails on both fronts..no real mexican flavors and the service is earnest at times but overall weak..big green pond big deal, who cares!! It is an old and tired spot that does have really good chips and salsa..it's a long way to drive for way average food and bad service
1;I was in the area saw it had 4 starts and decided to give it a shot.\nReality the food is alright, however very bland. It does come out very fast which makes you wonder. The price is very cheap with a good amount of food for only $5.95 for lunch though. I probably wouldn't eat here again, but it was better option than Rally's, McDonald's or my work cafeteria.
1;My family attended a wedding in Tonto Basin this past weekend (Congratulations Sarah and G.W.) and we were guests at the Tonto Basin Inn. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, Carol Duke and her husband were so incredibly rude and after speaking with other guests, it seems neither of them are people persons!  \n     The room was not the worst thing in the world but the sink leaked and soaked everything once the water was turned on. The shower was a hit and miss where some showers had decent pressure and others, hardly any at all. Mid shower for my husband, all water pressure went away and started dripping only out of the bathtub nozzle rather than the shower head. That's never a good thing! Don't expect many toiletries here, other than a little packet of conditioning shampoo and the smallest bar of soap ever! Don't bother trying to get any kind of service either because it's a help-yourself-to-the-maid's-cart which is left out all day and night. I did like the hard mattress and the air conditioner in our room was the best A/C, especially since it was just a window unit.  WiFi didn't work for anyone in our room but probably because everyone in the other 15 rooms were probably trying to use it, too. \n     Although the owners lacked any kind of personality and were rude and unfriendly, the inn itself was not that bad. If you're planning on staying here, just keep in mind what you're in for when it comes to the Dukes. (Killing them with kindness doesn't work either!)
1;I am not a big fan of Rachael Ray, but she doesn't get on my nerves nearly as much as she did when she was all unfiltered perkiness. Now that she has been homogenized and Oprah-sized and puts on make-up like Jack Nicholson as the Joker, I am somewhat sympathetic to her insatiable need to be the people's home cook, the pint-sized Paula Deen. Maybe that's why I was rather turned off by one of her Tasty Travels recommendations, the Egg & I on the corner of a strip mall out on Sahara Drive in Vegas. \n\nEven though it doesn't have the A-frame roof, it's really an IHOP with a country kitchen vibe that seems to draw the who's who of the Convoy-and-trailer-park set. Rachael was giving her thumbs up to this place for all the egg dishes they offer. That I won't argue as the menu went on with variations of omelettes and skillet breakfasts that span the globe and stretch the pocketbook. Jamie W. was being very good and ordered the Original Breakfast Burrito (see photo). However, it was quite a log that came out with a flour tortilla stuffed with four eggs, diced bacon, bell peppers onions, potatoes, cheddar and jack cheese. It came on top of a plate of cubed ranch potatoes and some salsa. \n\nIt honestly tasted like any breakfast burrito, just more of it to justify the entree-level price. I went all self-indulgent and ordered the Blackened Prime Rib Benny, an Eggs Benedict variation which had little cubes of prime rib (whether it was blackened or even prime rib was quite arguable), sauteed spinach, roasted red bell peppers all chopped over what looked like a slice of Texas toast. Two poached eggs lay on top, and I asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side (see photo). Thank goodness since it was the congealed variety that clogs arteries faster than Drano cleans them out. It was on the meh side with nothing hofbrau-ish about the meat at all.\n\nThe dish came with the same cubed, packaged-looking potatoes Jamie got, and neither of us had any desire to finish them out. When you order coffee here, you actually get a little pot so they can charge $2.25 for it. Jamie had a glass of milk but it was $2 for just six ounces. Hell, I would have lactated myself for that price. Service was efficient, and even though they have a little egg sign you can flip over to get a waitress' attention, there was no need for it since they seemed interested in turning over tables lightning fast. I'm afraid I will need to second-guess Rachael Ray's judgments on what amounts to good eats on her travels, or else I may be doomed to high-calorie intakes of mediocrity. \n\nFOOD - 2.5 stars....just thought the dishes were just too generic despite the abundance...it didn't seem human hands touched those ranch potatoes \nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...country kitchen quaint if that's your idea of charming \nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...efficient if rather impersonal, no need to flip that egg sign over on a busy morning \nTOTAL - 2 stars....right on the border between 2 and 3 stars, but I need to go with my bulbous, post-benny gut on this one
1;Food is good but staff/service is HORRENDOUS. Every single time I go there they mess up my order, in my opinion they need to hire all new staff. And when I complained, I got attitude from the manager. Worst McDonald's.
4;I originally went to Movement Restoration for the first time with a Groupon deal. I had the reflexology with Trisha last year (2012) and it was wonderful!\n\nSo much so that I went back again yesterday (2/21/13). This time I had reflexology with Justin. He was friendly, respectful, and I could tell he really love his job. His passion for what he does shows through and consequently, I had one of the best reflexology treatments I've ever experienced. This is saying a lot since I have been getting reflexology treatments for years!\n\nI was very impressed with his knowledge of the foot areas and the body connections associated with them.\n\nI highly recommend Movement Restoration. I can't wait to go back again soon!
2;This is Moe's so you know what to expect.  I usually only go on Mondays for the $6 burrito, chips, and drink deal.  I find it to be way overpriced at the regular menu prices.  For example, a fountain drink and a burrito with steak and guacamole is about $10 before tax.  Most of the food is good but the steak is very chewy so go with the beef or chicken.  I am not a fan of the help yourself salsa.  I love salsa and I have not found one here that I like.\n\nThe layout of this place is also confusing.  When you open the door, you will be right in the middle of the line.  The parking is also limited and with at least another business or two opening in the same building,that's going to get worse.
4;Great Resturant for lunch or diner. Salsa and chips are so good I can just eat that and I'm happy. Taco, enchilada and chile relleno plater is very good. It's loaded with yummy cheese.
1;Crappy store in a crappy run-down part of a crappy run-down area. This is one of the depressing parts of town where the junkies and hookers live.\n\nScratch that - even the hookers are probably too classy for this area.
2;"So I love the eggs benedict here but I think the buck stops there. \n\nI had acquired a voucher for 5\u00a3 off a main so me and another mama ventured to browns with our toddlers and a baby in tow. It was a good deal cause we both had vouchers which (depending on your main)  could mean lunch for 2 pounds! Not bad! \n\nWe both got the chicken and avocado sandwiches (possibly cause we are both Cali girls). The chips are thin and very yummy but the sandwich was a mess and the chicken was dry and hardened at places. Kind of a let down. The seasoning was fine but the actual ingredients didn't seem to work well. The focaccia bread wasn't adequate and broke apart. The sandwich just didn't work for me. I was bummed but not too bummed cause I ended up spending about 3\u00a3 on lunch, which is quite alright!\n\nIf I had paid full price I would have been pissed and not in the drunken sense if you catch my drift ;)\n\nAlso, the kids meals/portions are HUGE!!! If you are dining with a toddler or smaller child probably best sharing your meal and adding a veggie side."
2;"If I were to base this review on Las Vegas restaurants, it would get 4 stars.  But since I live in the greatest city in the world, it gets 3.  \n\nWe had an 8:30 reservation on a Saturday night.  The restaurant was not full, which gave me a little bit of a nervous feeling.  This was \""the restaurant\"" at Mandalay bay.  \n\nThe food was ok, nothing to brag about, but nothing disgusting either.  The service was bad until they gave us some free deserts (so averages out to \""A-ok\"").  \n\nI had a great time because of the company, but next time I am in Vegas, not going to come here."
3;I've been to the Forth Floor Restaurant many a time, courtesy of my mother's preference for Harvey Nick's browsing and kind invitations to lunch on a fairly regular basis. I've enthusiastically consumed both lunch and dinner here, so can attest to the fact the food is ace, along with the cocktail menu, which is pretty snazz too.\n\nFishcakes, always good. Caesar salad, the classic lunchtime favourite, also never a letdown. The rib-eye steak and frites, also the target of a good wolfing down in the past. Nothing on the menu here has ever offended me, or has really ever been bad, in simple terms. One of the biggest pulls of the Forth Floor Restaurant, and certainly one of its most striking points, is its top floor location overlooking St Andrew Square, plus you even manage to get a wee peep at Fife as well. On a good, clear, sunny day, when you've got time for a leisurely lunch (whether liquid or not), who wouldn't be keen for an outdoor seat on a balcony, from which you can gaze at the awesomeness that is the Edinburgh skyline? You know you would.
2;Ambiance is exceptional, just wished the food matched.  Food is underwhelming.
0;A five star restaurant for me is a place firing on all cylinders, with great food and flawless friendly service. Each star down usually involves some sacrifice in these areas, with one star being bad at both. This is the first time I'm writing a review that is one star entirely because of service, because the food itself isn't bad. But the service was awful to the point that it is worth my time to warn people away after my experience there this event. I went in with a few friends for some drinks and snacks at the bar. I'm not sure what his problem was but the bartender was a complete jerk. Service was slow for us food wise and that normally isn't an issue but someone tending bar should be friendly and accommodating not snappy and rude for no reason. We weren't the only ones with an issue, as the bartender decided to yell across the restaurant at another party, making rude remarks about a patron and ordering her to leave. It was like being transported into the soup Nazi episode of Seinfeld and completely shocked us. This place must be doing great if they can afford to have an employee ordering clearly sober and not disorderly customers to leave and put off other customers in the process. It's rare to see a place throw money away like that but after seeing how that lady was treated and after the attitude my group got, they won't be having me back even if their food isn't bad. I can cook at home, I go out to eat for the experience and the service, and Cantina proved that they don't need customers or don't want them, I'm not sure which. I won't be recommending then to anyone now, and after putting on this type of display, I doubt I'm the only person who was put off.
3;Grabbed a few things from here to go and everything was pretty tasty!  The Vegetarian Spring Rolls were yummy with fried carmelized onion threads instead of shredded pork... the dipping sauce tangy and sweet.  We also got some tiny sea snails cooked in a coconut sauce with a hint of yellow curry.  Basically they're so small you have to suck them out and along with that come the tasty juices!  We also got some larger sea snails which were steamed and served with a simple fish sauce.  I actually preferred dipping these big boys in the coconut sauce from the mini-snails.  All in a all a good take-out experience and the crawfish Austin C. mentioned sounds tempting since there are not really any good places to go for this in Phoenix.
0;"SHAME ON EXCALIBUR HOTEL/CASINO.\n my fianc\u00e9 and I checked into this hotel on Saturday for the first time ever. We were just starting our vacation, this same night we came back and I placed my purse on the dresser which is 2 ft from the foot of our bed, we went to sleep about 1am. We were woken around 4am-5am to our door being slammed (strange as I ensured our door was closed before bed) as we checked our room everything seemed to be ok, we assumed it was just the neighbor slamming their door, still unsure of why our door was cracked open, we went back to sleep. we woke up in a few hours later and started to get ready and then realized my purse was missing. It all came together, we were robbed in our own hotel room. And to make this worse... the robber was in our room and robbed us as we were sleeping. I'm scared and very disturbed by this situation and I want to make sure as people as I can tell know about this. I reported this to the casino security and they showed us how to properly lock the door that has no dead bolts. they promised follow up the next AM as their \""risk management\"" is not there on weekends. I still have not heard anything. but someone out there stole my purse and my wallet in it. including credit cards/cash/ and my ID's. I will be taking this up with an attorney. as I came home to research this incident, on many travel sites including yelp have reviews from many other people that this exact thing happen to them and the hotel did nothing, and they are still pending a response on their incident. PLEASE BEWARE OF THIS CASINO. ROBBER ON PREMISE, AND CASINO DOES NOTHING."
3;"Excellent food, beverages and service in a decidedly French Restaurant atmosphere. We had a wonderful time with a party of 4, the service was superb. the food was tasty and excellent quality. I ordered what the menu described as a Ribeye Steak, but it looked and tasted like a particularly tender and flavorful Filet Mignon.  The souffle and sorbets for desert were superb.  I recommend this restaurant and would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that the server misrepresented the size of the deserts, insisting they were small single serve portions not suitable for sharing, when in fact the desserts were very large servings very much suitable for sharing... The sorbets were three full scoops! This made us feel like we had been \""sold\"" on ordering extra desserts, which was quite \""tacky\"" for such an otherwise superior example of a French Restaurant."
4;"I had a groupon for this place and had to use it before it expired. My jaw literally dropped when I set foot at this establishment. This place is an oasis in this desert. It was very clean and the staff was very cordial and they showed me around the place. They even have this arcade that played the classic 80's games! Kim was my stylist and she was great! In addition to my great cut; my hands were treated with a soaking in paraffin wax and had a scalp massage and facial. I'll definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a great cut or an overall pampering. Thanks Kim and the American Male staff!"
4;I decided to check this place out, because I wanted to see the UFC and not pay for it. I am glad I did, great place. I did not eat anything, just had some drinks while I sat at the bar and watched the fights. The bartenders were awesome. I think I will come back and check out the food some time.
2;I've tried:\nKobe Slider Trio (BLT/BBQ Onion/Blue Cheese): Very Juicy and Flavorful! Its small, but quite meaty!\nAmerican Kobe Burger: Very Juicy as above. \nSome special of the day (reminded me of the umami burger LA with the crispy Parmesan): Not bad, but i probably prefer umami burger\nCreamsicle Milkshake: goes well w/ the burgers, too much whipcream...\nKrispy Kreme Doughnut Bread Pudding: very very sweet...makes me feel guilty...ill probably pass on this next time\n\nNothing special about the service, but i love the modern diner like interior...
2;"A birthday dinner bought us to Ichiza recently.  We had a reservation, but they still weren't able to seat us for 20 minutes or so after we arrived. We got seats at the end of the sushi bar, a fine spot, though a bit cramped. The little house appetizer they brought out was fair, but nothing extraordinary. The menu was decent, but the specials (all over the walls and above the bar) seemed to offer much more variety and interest. Unfortunately, there didn't seem to be rhyme or reason as to where to find anything on the walls. I read some Japanese, but from where we sat we could only make out a fraction of the offerings, and it was much too crowded to get up and walk around, hanging over others' plates to get a better look.\n\nWe ordered tako wasabi, though we never found it listed. It was average. The grilled squid was good, if a bit tough. Fried oysters were good, but we would have liked the spicy mustard that belongs with them. The crazy roll was fine, but pretty much available anywhere.\n\nWe felt the set-up of the place was a bit too compartmentalized to call it a true izakaya. There was none of that \""shared space\"" feel. All in all a fine meal, but a bit of a disappointment for a special occasion."
4;WHAT!? First off, why have I not left a review for this place. After all, it was Yelp that helped me find this supa-dupa-awesome office. Secondly, if you are looking for a new dentist, I HIGHLY suggest this award winning (litterally) dental office!\n\nMy history: My experience with the dentist hasn't been bad. I don't have many-to-any dental problems besides the fact that, like everyone else, I don't floss enough. I come from Ohio, where the waiting list always seems long to get in. Maybe, that was just one office.\n\nIn the middle of the Summer of 2011 I started having bleeding gums. Not just when brushing, but just gushing out (I know, graphic). I tried to tough it out, especially since I had an appointment with them about a week later. I woke up with massive blood clots in my mouth and so I called them at like 2am asking them to see if they could fit me in that same day.\n\nThey called me back as soon as they got into the office and said they had a cancelation for later that day to which I agreed to. I went in and it was quick and easy. I remember my mother filing out tons of paperwork but this was easy. Maybe times have changed a lot since then?\n\nIn any case, they got me in, and out, quickly when I arrived. They did a smal little clean for the area (I had a popcorn hull that had seriously impaled my gums) and signed me back up for a deeper and more extensive clean a few weeks after that. I did that, and even though they did a deep clean, they did a normal clean because I didn't need a deep clean.\n\nSince then I've had one other routine cleaning and I love it here. It is effortless.\n\nBonuses - they give you nice little shades to wear so that you're not blinded by the lights. Secondly, if there is an issue, they will take pictures of it and show you on the TV screen in full glory. You REALLY get the message then.\n\nI've dealth with Amber, Mary, Kathy, Kaysie, and Dr. Tom.
3;The coffee is pretty good and the place is always busy. There are always pretty girls here, but it can have the pretentious vibe too. The food isnt bad either, but i can only speak for breakfast.
2;"went here on august   eighth  2008  get it ? 8-8-o8\nto bring me luck ! \nhad the cashew chicken   it was fairly good \n\ni did also see a table full of partrons get bounced  from the table they were sitting at  for a group that came just befor them  and waited  a long time ....  what is it with  888 and people sitting at tables &amp;gt;?\n\ni had a four seat table all to myself .... i cannot complain"
3;A new frozen yogurt shop has opened in San Tan Valley/Queen Creek! It is conveniently located next to the Dance Matrix studio I visit, so after dazzling my partner on the dance floor, I could go for FroYo. \n\nThis is basically like all the frozen yogurt places out there, except it is on my side of QC! The flavors were good - I saw a pistachio I wanted to try, but then I saw coffee (which is my favorite ice cream), banana - which I would be good to try and mix with something...but then I was swayed by thin mint and cake batter.\n\nThe prices here are the same as most others - 39 cents per ounce. They have a loyalty program as do the others - but they take your phone number so you don't have to worry about losing the little punch card then ultimately having multiple cards. Good seating, nice lighting, and a comfortable atmosphere.
1;"Very pushy staff - tried a sample and ended up spending almost $40 on tea. The tea was wonderful, but the price was not mentioned to me until I was standing at the counter and my salesman was trying to tell me I needed to keep my tea in a \""very special\"" container that he was going to fill for me. During that sales pitch I noticed the price for the tea on the container he was holding - 24.95 for 2 oz! I immediately mentioned the price and he acted like it was no big deal. I do take some responsibility for not stopping him right there and walking out but I honestly couldn't get a word in and the next thing I knew was walking out with the most expensive tea I will ever own. Never ever walking past their entrance again!"
0;I love Mexican food but customer service is horrible so I tend to avoid it now. I hate being ignored especially when you only have a few minutes to eat. The staff is plain rude, we went to Blondie's accross the street, service was still slow but the waitresses are quite friendly.
2;A friend and I came here today, as we were craving Syrian food. Damas (a few blocks away) is another Syrian place that he had been to before but it is only open for dinner so we decided to try something new.\n\nFood - the menu has quite a good selection of appetizers and entrees. We decided to start with a fattoush (Mediterranean salad with toasted pita chips) and a kibbe nayyeh which is essentially a Lebanese/Syrian version of beef tartare. The portions were both quite large considering we got the smaller versions of both appetizers. The salad was delicious (probably the peak of our meal) and the kibbe was alright. It lacked depth and complexity of flavor - probably needed to sit a bit longer with spices. For the mains, I am a big fan of kefta (lamb) and tart/sweet fruit sauces so I got the one that was cooked in a sour cherry sauce. There was also a pomegranate tahini sauce. It was very good. The meat was tender and it was paired perfectly with the side of rice that accompanied it. The flavours could have been a bit more complex and it felt like nutmeg overpowered the meat a bit, but overall it was very good. My friend got the braised lamb shank with friki (wheat) and while the meat was well cooked and tender, it was completely devoid of flavour. It had no seasoning or herbs and even the yogurt dipping sauce that came with it didn't help much. For being what seemed to be a special of the restaurant, it was quite disappointing. \n\nService/Ambiance - We came in on a Sunday early afternoon and the restaurant was pretty much empty - there was only a family having lunch so we were seated quite promptly. The service was below average to average. Basically it seemed like he just really didn't care. He did answer our questions about the menu but that was the extent of our interaction. No one came by to check how things were tasting and it was a bit slow at the end to pay. The restaurant is pretty bare bones. It's a pleasant atmosphere but nothing extraordinary. It is a good casual place to grab food. It is a decent size so probably good for groups.\n\nOverall, we were left full and relatively satisfied with our meals. From what I have heard, Damas would have been a much better option, albeit at a higher price point. I don't think I would come back here but it was not an unpleasant experience. It is just that for what we paid, we could have had something much better elsewhere, considering the extensive choice of food from this area in Montreal.
4;Still one of my favorite places to stay. I was a little worried at first when I had to sign an agreement upon check in. Something new. No parties, no outside alcohol, no smoking in the room. But that's what we came for! Soooo I was pleasantly surprised when I didn't get any additional charges on my bill. :) We did have to get security on our floor due to guys that kept hitting on us and leaving a note on our door. Not the W's fault though. They got security up there right away and gave us free breakfast. Also the pool is amazing. Drinks are a little expensive, I only know because I bought a round of birthday shots. But who buys their own drinks anyway when you're in a bikini?
1;"So you're from outta town and you want some peace and quite without all the noise. You're not interested in paying any premium. Massage with happy ending is not on your mind. You just want to lay back soak your dam feet and get a rub down. This is the place.\n\nPros:\n- No appointment needed. Just pop in and say, \""I like a foot massage\""\n- Nice Asian lady who doesn't speak English, so no worries about her asking you if you wanted a happy ending.\n- Small snack plate provided so you feel like a king.;P\n- Private room for you and your bf/gf. I brought an imagery gf with me so she was chilling ... naaa, the next chair was empty so I have the private room to me self, what sup playa! Living large in Las Vegas!!! Hahhahahaha!\n-Boba shop right next door, so after an hour of rub down go next door for some milk green tea boba, what up playa! Living large in Las Vegas!!! Hahahaha j/k again :)\n\nCons:\n\n-Massage was decent but I was spoiled by foot massage back home.\n\n- It's $40/hr so I guess it was cheap in LV. Back at home it was $15/hr. Yeah China products are cheap so are the imported immigrants. \""What?\"" What I say? \""They're people Joe, and they're working hard!\"" yeah? I don't give a **** just kidding. Dude these comedians are bad influences. I'll write anything for a laugh. I heard this China lady came to US with nothing now she's has a house and a business. So stop tripping. \""No one is tripping, Joe.\"" Oh. Ok then.\n\n- No happy ending, hahahahha j/k wasn't expecting it. Don't want some unless you got butts hons. Oh man, what's going with me must be the sugar from the rice crispy treat I made.\n\nGet an hour of quite and decent foot massage here. It's not like I travel to LV by myself to get a foot massage. My entourage are busy gambling plus I can use time away they drive me crazy!"
2;Stopped in for a quick lunch.... \n\nThe first time I ate here I tried the seaweed salad... Delicious.. so I wanted to order it again... \nI had asked one of the wait staff if I could have the salmon lunch special but change out the regular salad for seaweed, he said ok... \nAfter being served the seaweed, and began eating it.. I was told I would have to pay full price that they could not subsitute it. $6 \n (tasted just as good as I remembered)\n\nWith that being said, I now had to change my lunch, so I tried the Sunkissed roll.. \nGood choice,  and they used brown rice and put the sauce on the side. \n\nAlong with an iced tea, it was a great meal... However with tax and tip it came out to $23, not what you would expect for 1 roll, cup size of salad and drink.
3;"I had some really cool conversations in this hostel.\nAnd it has excellent amenities.\nFirst hostel with nice countertops I've ever seen.\nIt is probably physically the nicest hostel I've ever stayed in. \n\nPhoenix seems like a pretty laid back place. \nAs one of the hostel workers put it \""We hang out a lot here.\""\nI didn't really talk with Amber but her and her friends were around and definitely very social and friendly. \n\nThis hostel would totally work for you if you like chilling out in the sun and/or drinking. Actually, it would probably even be cool for a hostelling staycation. \n\nThings relatively near here:\n-A gas station\n-A Chipotle(burritos, etc.)\n-Zoe's (grilled pimento cheese, spinach rolls-- this stuff was good)\n-The little bar the hostel peeps seem to like  hanging out at. \n\nThings near but sort of far unless you have a car:\n-Safeway (groceries)\n-CVS (pharmacy things)\n\nThings I did while I was here:\n-Desert Botantical Garden (gorgeous!)\n-Musical Instrument Museum (coolest museum I've been to in my life!)\n-Shopped at Mercado Mexico (Mexican imports)\n-Shopped at House of Rice (Japanese imports, origami paper and pan-asian food supplies)\n\nThings I can't comment on:\n-Public transport; I didn't take it and rented a car at my friend's suggestion, since I wanted to visit the PHX suburbs. \n\nThings I can comment on:\n-I didn't fall off the top bunk. And generally prefer them since, idk, didn't everyone want top bunk as a kid? But, these bunks have no guard rails.\n\nWeird shit that isn't really directly relate to the hostel:\n-There were a *lot* of guys here. Maybe it was just my week or whatever. But, seriously backpacking ladies come and even this dynamic out!\n\n Guys on backpacking trails are often only looking for two things \""alcohol and easy american women\"" as two guys in this hostel just so happened to tell me quite freely. But, ugh. Bored dudes in the desert, no bueno. \n\nSo, in short, facilities gorgeous. But, probably not the right place or week for me. \nI guess I wonder what the general demographic is that makes it down to Phoenix.\n\n The city itself was a pretty cool sprawling mass though. Definitely growing and \""new\""."
1;"I went into this with an open mind.\n\nI'm not looking for Mexican food- I'm looking for Mexican inspired food. If I want Mexican food- I can go to many other places right down the street for the real thing.\n\nI'm not judging the tacky decor or the awkward Cinco de Mayo celebration. I'm able to ignore these things. I can ignore that the food is not really Mexican (like I said, I'm not going to \""Loco Lime\"" for an authentic experience)\n\nHowever...I cannot tolerate and I cannot ignore bland food. Incredibly dull. All of my friends who hate spicy food seem to like it- so that might be what the big divide is about Loco Lime. I simply think it is too bland. I have tried it 3 times. I want to like it."
1;OVERRATED! I was disappointed with my burger. I mean, it was good, but not worth the price. You have to purchase your fries and drink separately, which runs up a bill of around 20$. That seems a little steep for a fast food joint. I could get a full meal at a&w or Wendy's for half the price. \n\nThey advertise FREE CONDIMENTS! Are you kidding me? I hope the condiments are free, my meal is already 20$!  \n\nOh but wait, they offer free peanuts. YAHOO\n\nI will not be returning. Waste of money
4;Great food! Great service. Fun waitresses and bartenders. Management is friendly, attentive, and grateful for your business. Fun atmosphere. Definitely a place to check out.
4;Walked in no appointment filled out the first time visit paper work then got my adjustment. $19 for first timers includes consultation and adjustment very reasonable monthy deals available $59 or $49 for 4 visits.\n\nLeft feeling a lot better then when I arrived ive been to other chiropractors here they take their time and find out what the problem is and go about fixing you up.
1;Buffet line wayyyy too long to even thing about getting into.  (seniors eat for five dollars monday nights)  So we walked to the next restaurant over which was Mi Casa.  The food is worse than chilli's, and its more expensive.  I got a carnitas chimmi, it tasted fine, but way too much salt for my liking (and I really like salt).  \n\nTwo stars because it was clean, service was ok, and the iced tea was a step above average.  Probably wont ever eat here again.
3;"I was excited to learn about a new place near work, though it is unlikely I would eat there for lunch due to crazy parking limitations (at work getting a spot upon return).  However, I can always stop by for dinner.  Eric R. and I went here this past weekend prior to my dropping him off at the airport.  We were seated at the bar in front of Chef Sai and also Chef Dragon (truly a cool name!) - the service and interaction with the sushi chefs was remarkable.  Our server was on the quiet/shy side, but she was certainly nice and refilled our drinks as needed.  The only app I ordered was the shishito peppers, which were teeny tiny but tasty and covered with bonito flakes.\n\nWe had a lot of sushi options.  I nearly passed out when I saw the specials board read \""YUZU YELLOWTAIL BELLY\"" but alas, no belly in stock.  Instead, we got salmon belly so that is a fine swap.  There is a delicious yuzu sauce similar to Monta Chaya's drizzled on sushi like tai.  We got whole scallop that was slightly seared via blowtorch also.  Eric R. was happy because he could order half rolls of many kinds of rolls to try.  I got a salmon skin handroll which was delicious.  I did not see handrolls on the menu but Chef Sai happily obliged.  I got amaebi which did not come with heads initially but were happily given upon request.  We also got the cocaine which is a super spicy sauced sashimi salad.  The sauce has habanero oil and gave my nose a nice run hehehe.  Saba is house cured and very tasty. \n\nChef Dragon gave us an assortment of the freshest of the day for us to try, including, sake, escolar, maguro, and hamachi.  I also got tako with lemon (asked for sesame oil but it may have been misheard).  I ended with the super rich dessert uni with quail egg.  The quality was quite good.  The ambiance is very different from its predecessor Kabuki, and it is painted dark and is a bit funky behind the sushi bar, with pictures and written menu like Ichiza's walls.  Great conversation with sushi chefs.  I will return."
2;I feel like the owner has ADD. There is clearly an identity crisis going on in the Duce. Is it a restaruant? Bar? Thrift Store? Gym? Rec Room? Who knows, why are the bathrooms so small? I'm so confused, but my gimlet was tasty and made the experience so much better. Would I go back? Maybe
4;"My roommate and I are doing an informal burger tour of Madison. We've been to a handful of dive bars and a couple of nicer restaurants. This was BY FAR the best burger we've had. The meat was excellently cooked; the bun was absolutely fantastic (is that something you can even say was fantastic!?); the bacon was melt in your mouth. Oh my gosh. Go here and get a burger! You won't regret it."
4;$40 a month for unlimited tanning beds & spray tan? Sign me right on up! Great staff, always nice! Definitely a regular now
4;I can't believe of all the years I lived near here I never stepped foot into it - glad we did.  We were looking for somewhere to eat and we just couldn't come up with any ideas and I thought lets try it out.  We walk in and I fell in love with the restaurant which is like a big sports bar with TVs everywhere.  We were seated in a booth and asked if we wanted to play the trivia game they have going on, so we each were giving a little device that was connected to a computer that kept track of everyone playing.  We had so much fun playing including my 6 year old daughter.  Fun entertainment.  Service was excellent.  Our waiter was very personable and knew the menu.  I went for the salad with chicken and watermelon which was very good.  My daughter had the macaroni cheese from the kid's menu and loved it and my husband had some big burger with onion rings (can't think of the name) and loved it as well.  Our waiter stopped by several times to fill our cups.  What I really liked was the menus which included for every item how many calories they had which is perfect for those like me who are dieting.  We will come back again.  My daughter loved it so much (mostly the game) and asked if we can go there every night for dinner - too cute.  We will be back.
2;The main thing is it's cool to have a local place to eat downtown that's not in a casino. \nOther than that, it's overpriced ($12-15 for traditional Thai entrees), and the food is solid, but not special. \nI like what they did with the back patio - the good things about sitting outside without the ugly view of nearby buildings and air conditioners. The front patio is kinda lame since they just put tables outside, literally right on Fremont. \nMy main complaint is the seating. We weeee originally seated at a bar top, only it doesn't look at a bar, it looks at a wall. Plus the dishwasher or something is on the other side, so the bar shakes like crazy. Constantly. Luckily, they honored our request to move to a table because it seems pretty annoying to have to eat there!\nProbably won't be back...too many other options!
4;On my way to my room at The Hotel, I walked by The Cafe several times.  It's an upscale cafe with modern decor.  It's a great place for breakfast.  After working for few days, I was looking for my husband to join me in Vegas so we could come here over the weekend.\n\nThe service is great, the seats are very comfortable, decor is relaxing and the food is superb!\n\nWe ordered...\nCrab Benedict - INCREDIBLE!  Lots of clumps of crab.\nHuevos Rancheros - Delicious!  My husband rarely empties his place and his plate was empty.\nCoffee was perfect!\n\nOne of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  Looking forward to coming back!
1;"Spent north of $1200 for simple food in one of their boxes last week. After charging me a %20 \""service fee\"" on the food, they ask for a %15 tip as well. Going to the ball park next time."
3;Holy crap huge portions.\nBiscuits and gravy were tasty.  Biscuits are a bit dry.  More a baking powder type.\nGravy had great flavor.\nEggs were done to perfection.\n\nIts a bit pricey for a Vegas Breakfast but worth it.\n\nWaiters all seem to be guys.  Very friendly, very attentive and working hard.\nGave us good recommendations.\n\nIf your on the strip looking for a good breakfast its worth the trip.\n\nPlace is a bit loud, lots of people and the decor has metal table tops and metal panels\non the wall so that makes it loud.\n\nWe'll be back.
4;I was recently in Vegas for a Bachelorette Party and I was reunited with Earls. Still as good as I remember it! We stayed at Aria so it was a bit of a walk to Planet Hollywood (most of thru the Crystals Mall Plaza) but it was totally worth it! \n\nI had to get my favorite Cannonballs! and it was delicious. Meatballs were delicious, the sauce was sweet and flavorful, and the cheese was melted nicely on top. I also tried the Earl's Club, Italian, and their Tomato Soup. Everything was oh so yummy. Their ingredients are so fresh and you cannot beat their prices! The long line that is always present should be a strong indication of how amazing this place is. \n\nNYC LOCATION OPEN UP ALREADY PLS!!!!!
4;This place is the best - fantastic / cheap sandwiches and friendly managers who really care about making sure your order is done right. A welcome addition to the downtown lunch rotation.
3;Yum! We visited the buffet for lunch. It was perfect for our group. There was no line, the only time we waited was for them to get our table together. They had a good selection of food, I personally was happy. I could have eaten a lot more prime rib and ribs, but didn't. I agree with some of the other Yelpers though, I wish they had a little bigger selection on desserts. 0ur waitress was cool, she even brought two cheesecakes over with candles in them for our two friends who were celebrating their birthdays. I'll be sure to visit the Bellagio buffet again in the future.
3;"Clearances are the way to go here. \n\nShoes on clearance are on the far wall; farthest from the entrance, and, shirts, bags, and other accessories are on the racks one must pass by before getting to shoe displays.  \n\nOther than the clearance items, and the twenty percent off discount found on receipts (offered for filling out survey), the prices for Converse at Premium Outlet Shops North are not that outlety at all.  \n\nPro Tips: \n+ One can stack the offer of 20% on the purchase of clearance items. \n- If you are looking for superhero Converses, like Superman, Spidey, whatever, if they do not have them here, try Journey's as they might be carrying them (also, not at \""outlet\"" pricepoints though). \n- They ask for your email to be put on an email list, but I have never received anything from Converse to date. I do receive spam from a plethora of sources though, although there is no telling if they are specifically guilty of any of it. \n\nI try to check out if they have anything I can live with, on clearance,  whenever I walk by. Very nice quality socks -- with nothing seemingly wrong with them -- for a buck or so, great quality shoes for next to nothing as well (~25$), and a staff that is helpful and seems genuinely happy to work there. This is one of my favourite stores at the outlet.  - E"
1;"I came with with an uncle- and cousin-in-law to watch UFC 141.  \n\nIt was a relatively busy night, but the service was very lackluster.  The drink girl came by twice, technically... once to take my order, and once to deliver it.  Even though I kept an open tab, I only had one drink since she never came by again to ask me for another one.  Bad move, since I would have purchased more drinks if she had come around.  \n\nThis place has NO food offerings at all -- no snacks, appetizers, etc.  No outside food is permitted, either.  The guy at the door said something about it, that they couldn't allow food since they allow smoking.  Whatever.  Bad business decision, since it would be wiser to have your patrons PAY for food and drink instead of paying only for drinks and smoke for free.  \n\nThe projector used to broadcast the show was slightly \""fuzzy.\""  I would have expected a better projector or TV setup, and the sound system showed significant signs of use... it's about time for them to either replace some equipment or maybe tune up what they've already got.  \n\nFor a $10 cover, it's not too bad of a place to watch sporting events, but I'd rather find a better place to watch the next event."
3;Great club. Great DJ.  The cover is $4 and coat check is $3. The place was a decent size but  I enjoy how the air actually circulates so it was not wicked hot like other clubs I've been to.  The best about this room was the DJ.  Otherwise it would have been just another club.  I do have to say cranberry vodka was on the weak side.
3;I have three favorite donut shops and I already reviewed the other two so I won't mention them here. This place has awesome donuts! In my opinion it's shop like these that put the chains to shame. The only thing dunkins has is their coffee... that is it. Good stuff... come here and get some donuts, then drop them off at my work!
3;Everything I have tried here has been great!  Tuna sandwich, jello, desserts, salads..
3;This place was bookmarked on my Yelp for a long time before we finally made the time to stop by. Man, I am so glad we did! We came on a Saturday about noon and there wasn't really a crowd so luckily we didn't really have to wait in line. I got a veggie dog combo with fries. One dog I got with rocket sauce and slaw and one with the cilantro lime crema and grilled onions and peppers. Both were amazing but the crema with onions and peppers was my favorite! My husband also got a veggie dog combo with fries. We were so shocked with how they looked and tasted that we went back in to make sure they were veggie, they were! We couldn't hardly believe it! We also got a free onion ring with our order because we used the yelp deal! The onion rings were ok but nothing I would probably order again, they were very greasy and the breading didn't stay on super well. \nThey had a good beer selection and we were able to get drafts for $2 each! Luckily on the day we went the weather was nice and we sat up on the deck to enjoy our food. We can't wait to go back! \nAlso, make sure if you live in Charlotte or frequent it often that you get a rewards card. If you get 50 points then you get $5 off anything, 1 point = $1... in two trips you could easily get enough points!
1;Pretty darn bad food. Most of it was cold. Wokee express is much better.  Not recommended.  BTW... bring your jacket,  cold as a meat locker in here.
0;"It makes me sad to have to write this update... Almost.  Let me just start by saying that I am not all that difficult to please, although my bf may disagree.  But seriously, I waitressed and cocktailed my way through college, both in bars and fine dining restaurants which makes me almost TOO forgiving when it comes to poor service since I know how many things can go wrong that aren't particularly the wait staff's fault.  This was not the case here.    \n\nWe arrived on a Monday evening to meet some friends for dinner and drinks.  We chose the spot expressly for the fact that both my friend and I had purchased Care Cards that benefit charity while giving you a 20% discount at participating retailers during Oct 14 - 23.  The Vig claimed to be one of these businesses.  Our party turned into about 7, and I had been seated for 15 minutes before our server came over to ask if I was thirsty.  I ordered a bottle of beer.  I see her next about 10 min later when she is delivering food to the table, although my beer is no where in sight.  She asks my companion if they want another, I politely let her know that I still had not received my first.  ANOTHER 10 minutes goes by, and my beer is finally delivered to the table.  In the meantime, my food had arrived.  They changed the menu and took my beloved seared sea scallops off and replaced them with Pad Thai (WTF?! there is no shortage of Thai offerings in the neighborhood) but they did add a few more healthy salads which is nice so I ordered a deconstructed fish taco salad.  This was the standout of the evening, and the reason for the 2nd star.  It is one of the best salads (healthy) I have had in recent memory.  Huge piece of perfectly grilled fish, crunchy salad with cilantro, salsa, guac, and black beans and cute little hot corn tortillas on the side.  \n\nAs the evening winds down, we ask for the check.  My friend had presented her Care Card when she first arrived with her husband, yet when the waitress brought the bill, there was no discount taken off.  Fine.  We see her about 5 min later and remind her.  10 min later she comes back with a revised bill with a whole $4.20 taken off.  Our check was $200.  I was no math major, but come now. After another 5 minute wait, I asked her why only $4 was taken off, she informed me bc only what the Care Card holder ordered had been discounted.  This was also bullsh!t because my friend ordered more indeed.  I asked to speak to the manager, and informed her that I also had a card.  Nowhere on the exclusions did it say: will only discount on the items the card holder orders (the nerve!).  We are all one party, with one check - and if you are participating in a charity benefit- effing do so!  They are providing you with free advertising and 7 customers you would not have had otherwise on a Monday night!  I have to use the restroom, so my friend says she will speak to the manager.  I walk back to the table to see a brown haired dude (the manager) rolling his eyes as he walks away assuring my friend he will \""take some more off\"".  We wait another 10 minutes.  I wish I was joking.  She comes back and presents the bill with $15 taken off the total.  I have never experienced such poor service and attitudes.  Sadly, this was not the first time this has happened in the year that I have lived down the street and probably frequented this place 2-3 times a week at my peak infatuation with the Vig.  But just like most relationships, what starts out all champagne and roses eventually turns into complacency and laziness which is why I am dumping the Vig.  It's not me, it's you.  You may look cute on the outside, but your personality sucks and I certainly won't introduce you to anymore of my friends.  I will never date you again, and I vow the only time I will ever contact you  in the future is if I'm already drunk and decide to meet up with you late night, but it won't mean anything."
2;Rocket burger has been on my bookmark/bucket list of places to try and this was my first time here today.  I got the cheese burger special for 4.99 includes fries and a drink , plus the 10% off if you check in through yelp . The cheeseburger had really good flavor it was dressed with the usual and what made it so special was the burger sauce. The sauce had a little bit of a kick , not too much but enough to make you want more. The only negative is the bun was too thick for my taste, but I ripped the inside of the bun and enjoyed the burger . The fries seems to be hand cut and I think they are cooked in some kind of veggie oil like Crisco.  They looked better than they tasted. Then again everyone has their own preference in what they think is a good French fry. Who knows it might be your cup of tea. Oh and by the way they had a crazy cool collection of soda pop.
4;A Hidden Gem! We had searched high and low for a floral designer with a more modern/current aesthetic in the area and finally found that with Urban Gypsy. The owner Paulette has an incredible spirit and kindness--you will simply enjoy just talking to her as you plan your wedding flowers. She truly customized our wedding day floral design and executed it fully. I couldn't be more pleased with the look of my wedding bouquets, decor, and centerpieces. She has a truly modern vision and thinks outside of the box. Stop into her store too, she has an amazing array of vintage jewelry and other items. I will definitely work with her again if given the opportunity.
3;We tried this restaurant for the first time last night and really enjoyed it. Our friends live close by to it and they eat there often, so we decided to give it a try. We weren't disappointed...\n\nI started off with a nice, steaming plate of Mongolian BBQ that I got to put together myself with what veggies and meat I wanted. I ended up getting noodles, beef, chicken, shrimp, sprouts, onions, mushrooms, bell pepper, and broccoli. I didn't add any sauce because when it was cooked, it came out perfectly seasoned from whatever the guy poured on the grill. The meats tasted very fresh and the beef was especially tender. A+ on the Mongolian BBQ!\n\nI had one of each of several of the sushi choices. They had a nice array of different rolls to choose from. Very nice selection. The only thing about the sushi I can say is that a lot of them tasted the same, so they seemed to use a lot of the same ingredients (imitation crab, mainly). However, they did have a very good selection of sashimi, so you could try all the different types of meats that way.\n\nThe hot food section didn't have quite as much variety as other, bigger Asian buffets have, but what they had was delicious. I especially enjoyed the Sea Bass and cream cheese rangoons. The rangoons were perfectly bite-sized and had wonderful, rich flavor. They could have used a little more crab in the rangoons, but they were delicious the way they were.\n\nWe did have to wait quite a while for our check, but the server kept our drinks refilled pretty well overall. The people working the front counter and behind the sushi/Mongolian sections were more friendly than the servers, but the servers seemed polite enough. The restaurant on the whole seemed very clean. The restroom smelled actually wonderful (weird, I know, lol) and was clean. They offer a gigantic bottle of hand sanitizer at the door, which is a nice perk. (If only they could make each person use it as they walk in! But then again, you can lead a horse to water...)\n\nSo, overall, a good restaurant-going experience!
3;"Las Vegas und \""walking on the strip\"" ist eins. Allerdings untersch\u00e4tzt man in der Regel die Distanzen zwischen den Attraktionen und holt sich platte F\u00fc\u00dfe.\n\nDoch warum alles ablaufen? Es gibt das gut funktionierende RTC-Bussystem. Die Busse fahren auf dem Strip und bis nach Downtown (Fremont) in ca. 10 Minuten Abst\u00e4nden. Die Haltestellen sind allerdings gelegentlich sehr unscheinbar und schwer zu finden.\n\nTickets k\u00f6nnen an den meisten Haltestellen an Automaten erstanden werden. Mit Kreditkarte ganz einfach. Ansonsten beim Fahrer in cash, allerdings genau abgez\u00e4hlt, denn es gibt kein Wechselgeld.\n\nMan kann Einzelfahrkarten l\u00f6sen (lohnt nicht) oder gleich ein 24-Stunden-Ticket bzw. ein Drei-Tage-Ticket.\n\nDas 24-Stunden-Ticket kosten $ 8 (Stand April 2013) und gilt auf die Minute exakt 24 Stunden. Es ist nicht personengebunden, kann also weitergereicht und damit von mehreren Personen im Laufe des Tages genutzt werden.\n\nDie Busse sind Doppeldecker, wer oben einen Platz erwischt, hat sehr gute Aussicht auf den Strip.\n\nAlso - F\u00fc\u00dfe schonen f\u00fcr die ohnehin langen Laufwege innerhalb der Attraktionen."
3;Always a great time.  I really like this chain and frequent it in many cities.  \n\nThis one is only a 4 star because the Chef was very poor.  The food quality was excellent but his showmanship was not there.\n\nDefinitely a good place to take out of town guests and groups.\n\nJT
1;Alot of parking and easy access in the afternoon.\nService was good and staff all very friendly to make the experience better.\nFood quality was medium nothing to Yelp about. Looked better than it tasted. Had jerk chicken that was just broiled chicken breasts and a light carribean dipping sauce (whatever). Doors were open and the animal kingdom came in. Birds flying around and pesky flies and knats NASTY!\nDrinks tasty and presented well. Overall mediocre event . Probably won't do it again as there's lots of options here.
2;So, let me say I think this is a great place for drinks with friends.  If you want a superb dinner with excellent food, start at the Henry and move on to one of the terrific restaurants in the Arcadia corridor.  My friend and I ordered the cheddar popovers and were disappointed as there were was hardly a trace of cheddar.  For my entree I had the Mediterranean Branzino.  It was tasty, however I found it a tad too buttery (if that's possible) and thought it a bit rich.  Worth $28?  Nah, don't think so.  For dessert we had a peanut butter banana concoction which was good.  I had a mixed cocktail and it was really great and my friend ordered the Riesling which she loved.   I do love the ambience with the bakery/cafe in the front and the booth we sat at was comfortable and spacious.  Again, wonderful place for a happy hour, or as some other reviewers have had great experiences with brunch, maybe that's an option. I would go back with friends for a few cocktails, but leave the food to another place.
2;Descent.
1;The happy hour every one speaks of is only available in the bar which is not the way it is in my home town. Everything I would have ordered in my home town also would have been covered for a bill of about $20 instead only 1 of the four was covered and after taking 1 item off it was still just under $40. Service was fine and so was the food. I usually tip at twice the bill since I'm getting it at half price and they still do the same work that's only fair. Oh I also ordered exactly the same last week at a different one here in Vegas and all of it was half off so ya low rating because I feel a little taken advantage of.
1;Needless to say.... my dining expierence was a little disappointing at the Keg last night. Below is a quick run down of all things Kopper Keg:\n\n-Very dimly lit inside.... granted this one seemed more dim then most. Maybe I am to used to Remedy's across the way?\n\n-Service was pretty good albeit a little slow at times. \n\n-My San Francisco burger was good but nothing to write home about. However, my friends chicken fingers tasted like they left it in the deep frier a little to long with extra breading on it. Kind of like a jawbreaker if you will but with chicken strips. \n\nOverall, no plans to head back to this place any time soon unless friends are just dying to go or I am starving and happen to be in their parking lot.
2;Most of the prices at these stores are still high, even for outlets. I went into Under Armour, Polo, Nike, Pacific Sunwear, Nautica and The Columbia Store. I found the best prices at Pac Sun and The Columbia Store. That is most likely due to the season change and I happened to catch a few good deals. I wouldn't go in the Polo store again because of the insane tags on clearance and regular priced items . Too bad because my boyfriend LOVES Polo. Lucky for me, I found some great hiking boots for 70 percent off and a cute beanie for under $10 at The Columbia Store. I was very happy with these purchases. I would not make a special trip to come shopping here, but if you happen to pass by the Outlets at Anthem, it might be worth your time. If you like Coach, which I do, but can't afford it LOL- they have a Coach store, too.
2;Ate here last night.  Not bad - but our choices were limited since it was 1) 10pm and 2) it ws hovering in the mid 30s and my buddy's apartment is nearby so it was a matter of walking.  I was in a mere t-shirt, jeans, and flip-flops.... I don't know what my deal was yesterday - I think it was my want for warmer weather to come back.\n\nAnyways... on to East Blvd Bar & Grill.  The menu wasn't too extensive, but I had a bowl of chili and everyone else got sandwiches or burgers.  I think the prices could be  a couple $$s less... but it could be the location and convenience of the place.\n\nI've come here to drink before and it's not bad.  There are tvs to watch football games and the staff is super friendly.
4;I heard a review on the local NPR station that said this was 1 of top 10 restaurants in Charlotte. I agree !  The chicken skewers were some of the best I've ever had.    The gyro's were pretty good too.  I definitely recommend Zeitouni's for casual food.
0;I used to love this place. Affordable, tasty and serving size is generous. Today I came in to order their infamous fried tofu and fried egg rolls to go. While driving I could smell the aroma and im just dying to have a bite! Once I got home and had a bite of the tofu first, it was dry and had no flavor what so ever then I tried the egg rolls it tasted horrible like a rotten fried fish. Thats not the only disappointing part of it I only ordered appetizers and was charhed $23.62!!! Wow!! I could have gone to a kbbq and ate AYCE with that price!!! I'm soooo dissatisfied with this order. I'm never coming back unless they change how they cook their food and lower their charges its too expensive!!
2;1st time here. Signed up for membership after years of not having one. I used to shop at costcos and sams all the time. I went on a Sunday morning. I know it's not the best day but it was a complete cluster fcuk. I will never go on a Sunday again. After not being a member for many years I was definitely disappointed in the selections at the costco. I will try the other store to see if they have better selections next time. This store was very small compared to others I have been in.
2;I don't like the physical layout of this club, it's too claustrophobic. It's definitely worth checking out though, and I did like the outdoor portions of the venue.  The dance floor was way too small at the show I went too.  3 stars because it was fun, but otherwise the crappy ass small dance floor makes me think of giving it 2 stars.  Walking up a ridiculous amount of stairs to get to the show was pretty stupid.
4;Its Taco Bell
3;I thought the food and service here was splendid!  We had sea bass and lamb chops.  The olive tapenade and homemade breadsticks were a nice accompaniment to our meal.  I actually had to use my phone to google some of the menu items, who knew that sea bass is also called Branzini?  \n\nThe food was delicious I just wished we had a more private seating arrangement. The ambiance of our seating was lousy, as there was a table with young children nearby (for 8 pm Saturday dinner), and loud party girls chanting over shots at the nearby bar rail.  Also we were seated next to a corner so lots of people were hurrying around.  Despite that, the service was great and the food was thoroughly enjoyed.
4;My friend and I came out to Vegas for a girls weekend. I had a restaurant.com gift card and this restaurant had some of the best yelp ratings for the restaurant.com options. We were very pleased with the staff and food. My friend has a gluten allergy and the wait-staff was very accommodating and helpful in their options. They were also great about allowing us to split a salad and entree. They even split it before bringing it out to us. \n\nThe New York strip we split was absolutely amazing. It was thick and flavorful. They give you a side of 3-types of seasoned sea salts. The Australian smoked sea salt on the steak was delicious and perfectly complimented the steak. The side order or mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables were awesome. Next time I am in Vegas I will be sure to stop here again!
1;Your general Baja Fresh but way too expensive because its in a casino
1;Poor, slow service. Food that was just okay. A manager who didn't want to make an effort to address either issue. The worst part was when we saw another table's food being brought out, with one plate of food stacked halfway on top of another plate of food. I would have flipped if I'd seen that with my order.\n\nI realize they were busy, I realize that our server was (by his admission) new. Doesn't excuse the fact that we didn't see him from the time we ordered to the time we got our check. Someone else brought our food. And the manager just blew off the mistakes. I wouldn't bother.
4;Great food, great drinks, clean, and good customer service.
0;I love Total Wine, but am disappointed by a rude employee there. John is rude to customers and other employees and he has no clue about customer service. I will not be returning to that store because of him.
2;Nothing like the Mass MOCA or PS1, but a good place to see contemporary art in Pittsburgh on a rainy afternoon. The museum has a number of great permanent installations, but the temporary installations are hit or miss and the curation is chaotic. The light installations are particularly good. Gift shop is ok, but please do not subject yourself to the restaurant.
2;"After stopping in at La Bocca and Z Tejas for a drink and appetizer, my husband, sister (who was in town for the weekend), and I decided to stop at Ra for a few sushi dishes and drinks. We sat at a high table in the bar area. Our server was friendly enough at first, although, as I'll explain below, she turned out to be really rude and unprofessional. The music was definitely loud, but I do think that the atmosphere here is great if you're in the mood to be out and about and around a lot of people. I wouldn't choose it for a romantic, conversation-focused outing, but it's not a bad place to take an out-of-town guest for a night out or to have an energetic night with friends. \n\nSince I was driving, I just had water. My husband and my sister ordered 2 of the specialty cocktails, which came quickly enough but were ridiculously sweet and weak. If you like drinks with some substance to them, I'd suggest ordered a regular mixed drink and not one of their specialty drinks, even if the cheesy names like \""Effen It In the Raw\"" call out to you. For food, we ordered the lobster spring rolls, crispy spicy tuna roll, and the yellowtail sashimi. The fish was definitely fresh, but the portions were ridiculously small. The lobster spring rolls were actually really good, and you get a decent amount of lobster meat for the price ($9.75). \n\nWe were planning to go to Final Round (a bar in South Tempe that has karaoke on Fridays and Saturdays) after, so we were thinking about leaving after we finished our appetizers, but my sister was still hungry, so we asked our server if we could take another look at the menu. She brought us the menu, but we quickly realized that we were full, so we told her that we were ready for the check. She all of a sudden got an attitude and just snatched the menu and walked away. We were sitting in the bar area precisely because we weren't planning on ordering a lot, and we didn't appreciate her attitude. \n\nWe paid and left, but my sister then realized that she might have left her debit card in the check presenter. When she went back to look, the hostess was really ditzy and rude about it and didn't even offer proactively to talk to our server about the card. My sister had to ask her if she could go find our server to help us. When my sister asked our server if she had seen it, she was really rude and snapped that she hadn't seen it. My sister asked nicely if the server could take a look in the check presenters, and instead of being helpful and kind in a situation that was obviously stressful, she stomped over, grabbed the check presenter with our check copy inside and shook it out, stating \""See? It's not here!\"" I understand that a restaurant like Ra is busy on a Friday night, but that didn't excuse rude or snappy service with an attitude, especially when it came to something serious. \n\nDecent sushi and appetizers and fun atmosphere weigh in Ra's favor. Small portions, sickeningly sweet drinks, and full-of-it service send its rating right back down to 3 stars."
4;When you walk in to Container Park you get hit with the smell of the BBQ place but this place is a hidden Las Vegas gem. The margaritas and tacos are incredible! I am not one for spicy food but this hit the spot. Service and atmosphere are excellent! I had a burrito with guacamole onions and salsa. Amazing. My sister had the tortilla soup which was a bit like curry and delicious. My peach margarita paired great with my meal. Can't wait to come back and try something new!
0;Blah! This location is horrible!! I usually go to the one on Sahara and it is amazing!! We were in the neighborhood of this location so decided to try it out since I thought it would be similar to their other one. I think it is the same owner, but they definitely do things different. Try the other location on Sahara and Durango, its great.
2;"Mucho Taco was ok.  It was nothing unforgettable; in fact, I'd forgotten about it.  While reading Andrew S's review I got to the part about his gf's Chimichanga, and I did a double take because I hadn't realized I'd been with him  for the experience in question.\n\nAs mushy as the chimichanga was, it had good flavor.  I'd give the place another chance, and probably get a burrito.  My only other complaint is what seemed like an unnecessarily long wait to get our take-out order.  \n\nLocated next to a Goodwill and in the same strip as several other small businesses, this place is easy to miss.  I probably wouldn't miss it if I weren't to retuurn, but it's decent enough if I needed some Mexican food nearby."
1;Disappointed. Overrated. Nothing special.\nGimmick donuts that does not even taste that good.\n\nOne of best donut place in US?  I don't think so.
3;"I visited Del Frisco's a few months ago with some friends of mine. We opted to sit in the bar area, and just order some appetizers and drinks. The menu is quite pricey, but this restaurant is upscale along the lines of Morton's or Ruth's Chris. Dress nicely when you show up here.\n\nThe service was attentive, professional and polite. It's exactly as great as you'd expect for a high end restaurant. The food was also a highlight. The appetizers we ordered were delicious. The fried calamari looked and smelled so delicious that I broke my \""I'll never eat *squid*\"" rule and tried it. It tasted fantastic. \n\nShockingly, I discovered at 40 that apparently I am incredibly allergic to calamari, as I went into mild anaphylaxis (it was my first exposure ever to calamari or any mollusc). Nevermind that, it was delicious! However, I've been informed that I am to never eat calamari or any other mollusc again. So sad. I'll say this, fried calamari was never tempting enough to even try until I it was in front of me at Del Frisco's, so there's that.\n\nAll in all, a wonderful dining experience. Just a little pricey for my wallet at the moment. Highly recommended!"
4;"This is my wife's favorite Resturant.  I really like it, but she absolutely loves it!\n\nThere is no way that either of us could finish a meal at Lolo's, so we team up on one of these delicious meals. Chicken & Waffles with eggs and grits! What a feast!\n\nI love the kool-aide! Go for the Grape, you will enjoy the ice cold \""mason jar\"" ... It's huge AND you get free refills.\n\nIf the food is great (and it is) then the service is even greater... Seriously great attitudes flow is this wonderful eatery!"
0;This place has a reputation for hiring only douchebags for waiters and they totally lived up to it. I wish I could tell you about the food but after almost an hour without getting any, we decided to leave. I don't think that a restaurant concept of rude service is a good one. Good service is important and this place totally failed on it.
2;I have done pick up since place is so close to my job but last Friday was first time I at inside. The food is awesome but service is not that great. It took over 15 minutes to get our 2nd drink order placed and another 20 minutes before they even brought them back. They weren't even busy so I don't know why they took so long. Also I wanted to try the frozen margarita with sangria but the sangria wasn't frozen so had to settle for a a regular frozen margarita.
2;"\""Guess what?! There's a sale at Kohl's!\""\nThis is the running gag between my parents. There's always a sale at Kohl's. And not just a lame-assed 5%, but 15-20$% off. Google for printable coupons before you go.\nSometimes they also hand out coupons at the store with your purchase, for your next visit. \nTheir Return/Exchange service is quick and friendly, and the dressing rooms were very tidy.\nI shop for clothes here every year when I visit. Granted, my taste in clothing is a bit unusual, so clothes shopping in chain stores is a challenge. But somehow I always manage to find stuff I like at Kohl's. They carry a range of designers, from \""trendy\"" names (snicker) like JLo and Lauren Conrad to more basic Croft & Barrow type stuff. \nThere are almost no skirts sold in this store, except for a couple of generic business skirts and some gynecologist-friendly miniskirts by Candies. \nOverall though, it's still worth checking out."
0;Worst buffet i've ever been to. Had many choices - chinese, italian, american, etc ...and they were all terrible - flavorless and tasteless. Complete waste of money!
2;I have pretty much come to the conclusion that these wings are the fast food of wings. Not that they try to present themselves otherwise but I just get a very generic feel from these wings.\n\nI will say that the service at this location is top notch. The cashier taking orders was very nice and made sure to clarify what I had ordered before she put the order in. I ordered three chicken strips with original hot sauce and fries with a side of cheese sauce. The strips were just okay. I would not go out of my way to order them again. The fries were the same. The cheese sauce that came with them was overall pretty bland. My true issue lies with the amount of salt that is used in everything here. Way too much salt. It became overpowering halfway through my meal. As one of the other reviewers said, I could also taste sugar in the fries which is just completely unnecessary. \n\nI'm not sure if I would come back to Wing Stop. There are certainly many other better alternatives for wings in the area. I might consider trying something else here but not any time soon.
2;For a while I saw this place being built and finally it opened.  I was excited to finally try it, but I went a while before I actually did.\n\nIm a huge fan of anything chicken and I guess I thought this was a wing place before seeing that it was literally all chicken fingers.  Ok, no problem.\n\nThe food is good.. but nothing blew me away.  I ordered their 4 chicken finger meal, which I guess is very popular.  It came with a side of fries, a piece of garlic bread and some slaw.  My favorite coleslaw is still the one from KFC.  The bread was soft and tasty and the chicken was ok.  The sauce they gave you to dip it in helped.\n\nSo it was good.  Would I go back? Sure, but it wouldn't be my first choice.
0;"Terrible service.... Worse food. Server offered a\""generic\"" salad with an entree. I'll warn my friends and will never come back...I must say that the manager was the best part about this place"
2;Good food as always however Togo experiences was not good. I had asked for ketchup packets the girl told me she put some inside but there were none. \n\nDining in experience were great our server remembers everything and offers lids for my sauces along with my to go box.\n\nThe food does take a while though both take out and dine in but I guess that applies to all the B dubs that I've been to. Lol
0;I've been a member of aaa since 1984 with cal state aaa and az aaa I haven't used roadside assistance much. Unfortunately when I need az aaa they let me down. All they seem to do is send out requests to upgrade or do add ons. I figured since I'm in the 6 largest city in the USA  plus service would be good enough. Apparently maybe if I was in the premiere group I wouldn't be sitting on a neighborhood sidewalk for more than an hour and a half. It's sad because I'm about a mile from the corp hq on cback and 24.
1;I've been to the Buffet at the Wynn before and had a great experience, however this last time I was a little disappointed. I am a sucker for crab legs, but the crab legs this time were very salty that I could barely eat it. Otherwise the rest of the food was good and I enjoyed the dessert. My biggest disappointment, at which point I became grossed out and could not even eat the hot food anymore is when my friend and I heard the noise of a nail clipper, only to look up and see one of the employees behind the station clipping his finger nails and I'm not sure if this would make it any better but wasn't clipping it over a trash can so who knows where it was flying into???!  And to make matters worse, did not wash his hands after and assisted a customer with food.
0;If at all possible, I avoid Lee's because of their political signage supporting rightwing nutjobs like Hutchison for Lietenant Governor.  I don't like the idea that buying a bottle of wine helps anti-marriage equality bigots get elected.  Civil rights are human rights.  There are plenty of wine and liquor stores that don't take positions on political issues.
0;Like the others below, I had a similar bad experience with this company. I also forgot to check here before I bought the living social deal. I am having some issues getting it refunded as well. Maid Affordable was a no show, will not call back, and does not answer the phone or emails. Definitely take your business to someone else.
0;The service here was appalling from the time I checked in. The girl at check-in insisted I give her the credit card that had booked several of our reservations (my bosses) and I had never been sent a credit card authorization form to differentiate each reservation.\nNeedless to say by the time I go to my room I was starving, tired and wanted a bite to eat before picking up my packages at the business center. \nI ordered a SALAD (no grilled steak or chicken atop it) and waited over an hour. At that point I had to skedaddle to a meeting and was even more hungry and frustrated and had to call room service and cancel the meal. Luckily I was able to find a bit of trail mix leftover from my flight to sustain me (barely).\nFrom that point on, I was continuously disappointed in what this hotel had to offer with exception to the guys at the bell desk. They were always prompt, positive and just a joy to work with (and I had a lot of packages).\nThe girl at one of the information desks (when I decided to cut my short at that establishment short) was SO unhelpful in directing me to where I needed to be I was so glad to be out of there forever. Good riddance, I should have stayed at The Wynn where I know service is always way above par.
0;For 10 years I have enjoyed coming here and recommending it to anyone I could.  The staff was always helpful and the meat was great quality.  I would buy perhaps 3 or 4 times a year for special occasions and the holidays.  Two visits ago, just after New Year's I was disappointed.  The staff  was disinterested and they acted very put upon when I asked questions about the different cuts.  The meat honestly looked about the same as what I would find in Albertson's or Von's so I just settled on some shanks for  osso bucco and was on my way.  It was fine, but not worth the extreme price and attitude.  I decided to try again last week.  Once inside the store was dark and most of the displays and shelving for their retail was gone.  It was hard to see the meat in the case as the glass was covered in heavy condensation.  I wanted 8 of   their delmonico steaks, (rib eye) but the clerk kept grabbing the new yorks.  When I pointed this out he snapped back that it was just a regional difference between the two names.  I ended up just leaving and bought the steaks at Costco.  I will try one more time in a few months to see if they have gotten their act back together.  They were really great for the last 10 years that I have patronized the store, I don't know what has happened.
4;Super awesome pool party. I went to the halfway to edc pool party during winter and it felt like it was summer. I had a blast!!!!
0;Bread for the sandwiches taste terrible, the pizza is awful, service sucks. If you see this place keep driving as a matter of fact try not to even look at it. It just ruins my appetite every time I do.
2;It's comparable to all other local bars, but gave 3 stars because it isn't as popular. Less people, less energy.
1;It took over 45 minutes for them to to seat us. We ordered the calamari As our appetizer and when it arrived it was substandard and did not taste very good. When our entr\u00e9es arrived they were cooked however the seasoning was lacking and the food itself tasted like something I could make it home. The staff was relatively attentive however for the price and the wait time was far below my expectations. I was reminded why I had not been to a red lobster in three years and won't be returning anytime soon.
0;I did not think the aquarium was worth the $18 price. It is also a 10 minute walk to the aquarium from the main hotel. Once we got there on a Saturday, the line was at least an hour. I walked to the front and noticed that there was a will call desk with no line. I called the hotel and bought my tickets and was able to pick them up immediately. \nI would have given 3 stars, but letting an hour long line form at an attraction that takes a long time to get to is just rude. They either need a warning about the wait near the hotel or more ticket agents.
2;Horrible Food, Excellent Service. Food served ice cold.
1;The brunch plates were big and beautiful but we experienced very poor service (part of our meal was forgotten and our food arrived lukewarm). I'd probably give this place another chance...eventually.
3;"Update as of 2/6/14...\n\nTip: sit at the bar if you can, the service will be more prompt and attentive, and it's a bit more warm (in the winter months)\n\nTip #2: ask for the extra spicy Blazing Saddle margarita. It features an even spicier infused tequila\n\nTip #3: visit during happy hour (4:30pm - 6:30pm); two margaritas and two beers were less than $15\n\nLooks like the menu has been slightly revamped; the bar menu features some street tacos that looked absolutely superb. Alas, I was off to Tempest for dinner, so there wasn't any food consumed during this most recent visit."
0;Best pho in Vegas but the service is slow and horrible. If you're that busy, hire more damn employees.
1;I used to love staying at this place.  My mistake in booking I was not aware of the construction, but I was given a renovated room.  It was so new the couch was too stiff to sit on comfortably and the pillows were like sleeping on a curb they were a foot thick and hard. I slept on my arm for comfort.  At 5 AM I was awoke by construction hammering in the room above me, however when I called down it stopped 5 minutes later.  The staff was rude as well.  Not sure I'll come back to this place ever again or recommend it.
4;A great family owned bike shop. Nice selection of new and used bikes with accessories that are reasonably priced. Owner is knowledgable and tries to meet your budget and needs when looking for a bike.
4;Pure magic. While the shop boasts a fantastic jewelry collection, the classes are really the rabbit that's pulled out of the hat. Shauna is so full of energy and encourages you to explore your inner artist, whatever that means to you. Music, beverages, crafts. It's a tripod of\na good time.
2;This place has steadily gone down hill since my first visit three years ago. Granted it's an almost direct proportion to Vegas slow sinking in general.\n\nThe prime rib and roast beef were so over cooked it was practically inedible and the selection of Asian food that used to include some delicious Indian and Thai entree's is down to basic Chinese and Japanese items with samosas which is pretty disappointing\n\nThe saving graces of the world buffet are the crab legs, and desserts like the red velvet, carrot, and cheese cake.  The cheese cake is easily one of the best I have had.  It is so creamy and delicious.  The Mexican food also had some great options like mole chicken.\n\nOur first waitress was pretty much hostile in trying to get us out of the buffet, but the second waiter was awesome so 3 stars
2;Was impressed.... At first....  Burgers are not the same.  All the dogs and brats are good, but not quite great.  Onion rings are great.  So is the setting of all the Buffalo college posters and pix on walls.  All that shines and glitters from the outside, doesn't make the dog taste better....  Great location of major cross streets.
2;Very nice guy (except: read below) and good prices. But when I went to collect my altered pant there were stains on it that werent there before. When I pointed it out the guy didnt even want to look at the pant and tried to ignore it. That was really unprofessional.
3;I absolutely adore Cracker Barrel, the food the store, the atomosphere! I took my son for a Mom & Son time, no complaints from him it's one of his favorites as well! It takes alot of food to fill my son's stomach but he had the pancake breakfast and finished every crumb, said he couldn't eat another bite. Brionna was our server, we never had to ask for anything, except for the yummy apple butter given upon request. My boy had never tried it, imagine that! He'll remember to ask for it now, loved it! I had the meatloaf sandwich, so good and cooked to perfection! Of course made a pit stop in the shop and picked up the cutest coffee cup at a great bargain! \nThe perfect way to spend a day! Great food and great company!
1;As far as the day goes it a nice place to goto, but when its dark I don't feel like they want my business and I don't mind going somewhere else and letting people know how they are (My money spends the same Epicentre its 2012 get it together).
4;I came here last night to see the Post Secret Live show. (It was amazing, check out post secret). But this theatre is amazing!\n\nIt's a very intimate little space, I have no idea how many people it fits (Yelpers say 700+).  The stained glass is really beautiful!  The McGlohon has such a good feeling, very warm and inviting.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  One of the super sweet ushers told us that once the lights went down, we could move closer.  She even scoped out awesome seats for us!  The theatre is located in Spirit Square, just one block up from the 7th st parking garage.  ($5 parking after 5pm!). There are a ton of restaurants close by, and easy access to the light rail.\n\nI had such a great experience here.  I've only ever been to the Belk theatre, and didn't know anything about the McGlohon when I purchased the tickets.  I'd absolutely recommend it, and will be back.
4;THEhotel is all about comfort and class.  From their lobby, to the lobby lounge, to the coffee bar, to the cafe, THEhotel is in a class above the standard Mandalay Bay offerings.  All their rooms are suites...725 sf or larger.  The rooms are huge and impeccably decorated in dark woods, mirrors, suede, and glass.  It's more like a boutique hotel with metropolitan flair.  The beds are magnets...you just can't get out of it once you lay down...it's true, they are comfortable.  A TV and phone can be found in almost every room of the suite (living, bedroom, main bathroom) except the guest bathroom.  The main bathroom is huge as well with a separate shower and tub sitting in the corner...we probably could've set up a roll-away bed in there and still have enough room to walk around.  Maybe next time.  \n\nIt's a shame that we didn't really get to enjoy the room and all its amenities.  The plasma TV is eye catching, and the couch, just as comfortable as one of the beds.  The mini bar was stacked, but came with a price tag.  My main beef...$11/day for internet use.  How can you pay so much for everything else and they not offer free internet???  1/2 star deduction for no free internet.\n\nO, and if you're ever in the mood to shoot pool, take advantage of the free pool in the lobby lounge...if you got the time.
1;"Terrible, overpriced food. My \""chicken\"" burrito was just beans and rice. That must have been one skinny chicken."
3;This place is a total dive but who cares, the Stromboli is awesome. Don't mess with it, just get the original full order, after 12 midnight it's half price which great when your out and about in Vegas. Highly recommended\nIGNORE some of these reviews, from the outside this place looks bunk and yes the inside needs a remodel ASAP, but the foodworks. Good service and great food.
0;Went for lunch.  My second time there.  Waited 25 minutes for one roll.  Waitress said there was a miscommunication between her & the chef.  Asked to have some food boxed up.  Waitress took the plate & never came back with the box of left overs.  She said she threw it away.  Manager said the best they could do is $2.00 off the bill.  Oh, and I overheard the next booth complaining & wanting to see the manager.\nNever again Momo!!!!!!
1;Was excited thought we finally found good local pizza...soo dissapointed. Service was great but we ran home to\n try the pizza and looked great love thin crust but was not crispy and taste was ok.was good sauce but no flavor to crust and was almist like frozen pizza crust...
2;Lovely place for an outdoor glass of wine when the weather is nice. The ambiance is a bit manufactured but what to you expect on a canal bank called The Scottsdale Waterfront. LOL
0;You never really appreciate your hometown offerings until you're stuck in a no-man's land suburb like Warrendale, PA where the nearest city is Pittsburgh and there beloved Steelers Fans. Now I'm not hating on Pittsburgh by no means, you were very warm and inviting to me when I arrived and had my short visit, but coming from Houston, TX - the second largest Vietnamese community outside of Vietnam itself - you don't know pho! \n\nThe sad part is the name of the restaurant, ok wait, that's the second saddest part about this place, the first part would be that it's Vietnamese owned and operated and yet the pho was tasteless, colorless, and why was the juice murky?! Please, as a reference please check out the photo I took of their pho. I added the red Sriracha sauce to liven it up a bit.\n\nI'm sorry, but come to Houston, pick almost (ALMOST!) any Vietnamese pho restaurant in Houston and you won't be disappointed. \n\nI do have to give Vietnam's Pho credit for atleast having the same aroma as pho. though.\n\nPS - Why doesn't any restuarant in Pittsburgh take credit cards?!
0;Feeling frivolous? CB&L is for YOU!  \n\nMy girlfriends and I were in dire need of some appetizers, and we happened to stumble past Caramel Bar & Lounge (and by stumble I don't mean in a drunken stupor, we weren't at that phase yet). So, we said hello to the host standing outside of the lounge as we read the appetizer list. Sounds good to us! So we walk in and get seated.  Nice place!  Total lounge feel, great ambiance.  That is, until our experience turned sour.\n\nWe asked for a couple items off their appetizer list and some water for two of us. We were then told that they aren't serving food as it was 9:17, just minutes after they stop cooking. Bummer.  How about removing the appetizer list placed outside that draws in the crowd?  So we disappointingly said water is fine, while we make our drink selection.  \n\nThe waitress, who looked underaged and under-experienced, arrives back with two 11 oz bottles of Fiji water for each of us.  We then order our alcohol beverages - 2 vodka/redbulls and one jack/coke.  Check is given.... wait for it... waiiiiiit for it.... $71.00.  Whoa!  Really? We questioned it and assumed it had to be an error.  So the waitress checks on it and comes back to confirm it is in fact correct, that the waters were each $10 and the drinks averaged $18 a piece.   Wow. I might sound cheap, but $10 for a bottle that small should come with a happy ending of some sort.  \n\nI finished the water pretty quickly... in a gulp practically, since there wasn't much to begin with.  My girlfriend had hers down about 75%  while she sipped on her alcohol.  Suddenly one of the staff members picks it up from the table and threw her water bottle away, without asking if she was finished!!  He just threw away dollars that we had spent! We told him his error, he apologized and talked to his manager about getting a new one.\n\nSo 5 minutes later the waitress comes by with a BELLAGIO bottle of water that looked like it was meant for a 2 year old.  You know, what comes out of their faucets probably.  At this point we're thinking:\n\nA) If Fiji isn't worth $10, neither is your faucet water\nB) If you had Bellagio water, why didn't you bring THAT the first time?!\n\nExplaining that we weren't going to accept a substitute for water that they had thrown away at our expense,  she gets her manager who comes by, drops off a new bottle of Fiji water without saying a word and just leaves. No apology, nothing! How the HECK do you get in management being a complete d*** like that?! Please tell me, because if I treated my customers that way, I would have been fired yesterday!\n\nAlmost hate to say it, but a tip wasn't left at this place. I hope she got commission off of scandalously selling water for an absurd price.  I know it's Vegas, but that shouldn't sacrifice good service and informing your customers of their options.\n\nSave your money and go elsewhere.  This place lures you in and then rips you off completely.
4;We were here for lunch last weekend and the food and service were both excellent! It's been a long time since we've received such great service. We had the pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries and fish & chips. Both dishes were great but I think the pulled pork was our favorite. We will definitely be back again soon.
4;"Went here on a Thursday Jan 16. I think we got there about 10pm ish. Fyi this is a actual bar that has been converted. I would say max seating capacity is about 18. When we arrived there was about 6 people ahead of us so the wait was about 35 mins.\nThis place is worth the wait! If you have never had steam kettle prepared food this is the place to try it! My wife and I both ordered the \""Palace Station Pan Roast\"" with lobster added to both orders. You get to select the spice/heat level of the dish. We kept both to a level 3 & that was pretty mild.I did see them make some level 10 using fresh habenero chili in it. And over heard the chef saying that they make one using ghost chili. All of this for me pretty much would waste the taste of the shrimp, lobster, crab etc.\nAnyhow our Pan Roast was the best we have ever had! And we have 2 places close to where we live here in so cal to compare it to. The Boiler and Ritter's SKC both of these places have ties to this place.\nWe also ordered 2 tiger shrimp cocktails. They were top of the line severed with a home made cocktail sauce with fresh ground horseradish. The quality of the shrimp were top notch.\nOK here is some advice........DO NOT come here if you are in a rush. Don't come here if you are impatient .Don't come here if you are not up to standing in a short line that moves very slow.\nFor us it was well worth the wait. Watching the staff prepare the dishes was a show in its self. Hangin out and chatting with the locals is way cool also. Most of the patrons that were here when we were, were locals and return customers.\nIt was nice to get out of our 5 star blah of the Aria and the ol 45 dollar buffet blues to have something different and tasty! We will definitely return here!"
1;Went in to the store to have my phone repaired, due to the screen being cracked they stated I had to pay for a replacement which was $100( my deductible ) I say ok he processes the replacement but states I can't pay cash it must be credit or debit because it's processed by the insurance company. I stated I only had cash the rude sales agent tells me I need to go get a prepaid card... WTH who says that to a loyal customer I bet if I chose to upgrade he would have been happy to assist me.  Im so tired of receiving poor customer service from these Sprint Stores!!!
1;I came here again in the afternoon around 1 expecting to order the carrot cake pancakes as I usually do. Our waiter had informed us that the chef decided to stop serving breakfast? Even though the menu said that brunch was served until 4?\n\nI'm giving two stars for the service. The waiters here are very slow and don't really check up on you. Our waiter was pretty rude when he told us breakfast was over as well. The food gets 4 stars though!
0;OCB was good several years ago. It has gone down hill and now it is nothing more than a place for people who value quantity over quality.
4;I went here with a friend and my toddler. We had amazing food for a great price. We got lucky and it wasn't packed. I love that they grow most of their food themselves. We walked around after in the Agritopia community gardens and is was so nice. I wish I could visit more often.
1;Sigh...wish i could give this place a good review.  The food was good.  Not great, but it was pretty good.  But it's happy hour and the service just sucks.  We waited 15 minutes in a mostly empty place for menus.  And then had to ask again for the water and chips we asked for when we sat down.  Another 15 minutes in a still empty place for someone to take or order.  And another 30 for burgers and fries.  There seemed to be plenty of staff on hand, most of whom were chatting with the hostess. And none of whom, except for the runner, ever bothered to see what was going on.  Hmmmm... Not sure I will  eat there again unless I've had a few cocktails, and am just looking for a place to sit and chat and mayyyybe eat a little something.
2;Store is clean and bright as hell. But they're slow on restocking items. I went there 3-4 days in a row in the middle of the week because I had the $5 off coupons. So mostly got things for free. There is a lot of items and ok sales in the store. But their clearance items was fantastic and is the highest throughout Vegas.
4;This is my daughter's favorite Thai restaurant, so she took me here for my 70th birthday.  I always have Green Curry the first time I try a Thai restaurant - and was extremely happy!  One of the best, anywhere!
2;Who doesn't love Ulta?  Customer service wasn't great at this location, so I'd probably try another store before returning here.
0;I really wanted to like this place, I really did. We each got 3 tacos each & the Fish/meat were ice cold on all of them. The tortillas were also cold & probably came straight from the bag to our plates. Really BAD!!! I will not be back!!!!!
1;V is for very, very, extra ordinary.  Not extraordinary, kids - just ordinary.  Prices are in line with most pho joints, but they are a little sneaky and cut corners with the servings.  The portions are large, however they majorly skimp on the rice noodles and meat - it's mostly broth and whatever greenery you choose to add.  In a large bowl of raw beef with meatballs, I had 3 meatballs and 4 thin slices of beef, and the equivalent of three mouthfuls of noodles.  PLUS I have to take away a star for a lack of mint - we had cilantro and basil but no mint.  It made me sad almost.\n\nCha gio (crispy spring rolls) were nearly devoid of filling, like mini cigarettes rather than the fat cigars you'd expect them to be.  Despite being tasty, they didn't com with any lettuce or greens to wrap them in to dip in the nuoc mam.  This also made me frown a bit.\n\nYoung coconut juice was delicious and fun, and left me scraping out the coconut for the tender flesh long after my soup and spring rolls were over.\n\nI'm not at all pressed to go back - it was so ho hum for the cost, and there are so many places in the area that are much more generous with their dishes.
0;Worst place for shows. You're basically paying to get your ass kicked by security. It's one thing to tell people they have to leave it's another to put them in a chokehold and drag them out the door violently. Avoid this place.
3;Everything I want in a neighborhood joint to make me jealous of not actually living in the neighborhood. Lovely setting and layout, good mix of conventional dining getup with sofa/chair/couch/table combos interspersed, waiters with cool hats, and finger-lickin fancy fare. Not too fancy for these jeans, but fancy enough for my heels. \n\nIt takes a damn good Bruschetta to make me crack my vegan ways, but I confess my cheese-avoidance got lost between the brie and the apples and smothered with fig. For me the bread was just a tad too soft, but the wine was just right. Fantastic for a romantic date or group gathering - will be back soon!
3;Traveling across the country and stopped in Pittsburgh for the night. The guy at the hotel suggested Sharp Edge and to make sure we tried the Mediterranean Nachos. \n\nThe beers were great! The food was great--everyone really enjoyed their food... and the Mediterranean Nachos? F'ing fantastic!  Our waitress was very pleasant, but kept changing her accent every time she came to the table. Not sure if she was bored and passing the time, or if she was messing with us.\n\nThe place was busy for a Tuesday night and everyone was having a great time. It had the feel of a really great local hangout.  Warm, comfortable, and inviting.\n\nIf/When I get back to Pittsburgh, I will definitely come back--if only for those nachos.
1;My boyfriend and I booked a room on the executive floor for new years. We got here right at check out time and we were told it would be another 20 minutes before the room was ready....an hour later, here we are in our room with a bath tub that the paint is chipping off of and the tv doesn't work. We were charged for a movie that we can't even watch. Highly dissapointed. You would think that with a big name like Hilton, the room and service would be superior. Very lackluster.
0;"So it's suppose to b \""the best\"" buffet in Vegas? A waste of money and time.  To start off with, they have a fancy kiosk system where u register for d wait list.  the estimate we would get a texted would b 8:11 pm (2 hrs wait).  But what's s point of that when they texted us at 630pm, for us to get in line (incomplete party not permitted)...a waste of technology I must say.  Kiosk did its job, but d human who manage it should have some kind of a brain to make it work in our favor. \nNow onto the food,  they looked good, but the line to get food was ridiculously long.  It's a buffet for god's sake, who wants to stand in line 20-30 to get a piece of prime rib, n to make it to d seafood section that's another 20 mins.  By the time u get to ur table, the food would have been cold.  So we had to settled shorter lines which serve food that u would get for $20.  Again, bad management.  They could have done better to make d experience better for us. We paid $55 each...not worth it at all.  Never again."
3;"I have a borderline obsession with Gordon Ramsey. Since I don't get cable, it's not with his Kitchen Nightmares or Hell's Kitchens or what have you - no, it's his ridiculous talent.\n\nPEOPLE. GORDON RAMSEY IS MORE THAN JUST A YELLING BRITISH MAN IN A KITCHEN.\n\nHe. Is. A. GODCHEF.\n\nThere's this series called Ramsey's Ultimate Cookery Course; 100 recipes to stake your life on. And I would. Stake my life on it.\n\nSo when Ryan suggested we go to get burgers, I said, \""Meh...burgers..\""\n\n\""Gordon Ramsey's restaurant.\""\n\nBURGERS!\n\nWorth the wait. Worth the price. Get the oreo shake with the creme brulee pudding and don't you fucking waste any of it.\n\nTheir whiskey cherry cocktail is too sweet for my taste and gave me a wicked headache.\n\nThe caesar salad was kale and romaine and despite being one of the most typically boring entrees, it was actually quite wonderful, mellow. The fries were great, too, and Ryan really enjoyed his burger (sans bun, because he likes to pretend he eats semi healthy).\n\nGoddammit Gordon Ramsey, you did it again. Of course you did, like I would have doubted you for a moment."
3;Moved to Mesa less than a year ago and we've been desperately searching for a good ole chicago style pizza place.  We're happy to report we found it in Fatman's Pizza.  Great deep dish pizza from a guy that's actually from the north side of Chicago.
4;Came early, super nice driver who charged me less knowing I was a college student. And they don't take longer routes to charge you more like Discount Cab. Rates a bit higher than others, but better to be safe than sorry.
4;My family recently moved back to Las Vegas a few months ago. Our old vet was over on Flamingo, so we resumed service when we settled in. We had a nine year old boxer mix dog who was not doing well. Our old vet was more concerned with upgrading sevices and selling us future care while we were concerned about his current, failing health. He was our 90 pound baby, and not really been away from me more than a couple of days the past seven years. He ended up having cancer, but our vet on Flamingo never tested for it. He became suddenly ill one evening back in August. We were prepared for the worst. We made peace with his state. He'd lived a wonderful, loving, nine years. Enter VCA Hualapai. We took him the next morning. They did their best, but it was his time. Dr. Jenei eased his transition as well as comforting our family. The entire staff is remarkable: sincere, knowledgeable, caring, and more concerned with our furry, four-legged friends rather than our bank accounts. We have a new 14 week old puppy who goes to VCA Hualapai and our seven year old dog will be joining him as well. I would 100% recommend them to anyone for any pet needs. Everything about this place is top notch and worth the value.
3;My wife and I went to Vida's based on good Yelp! reviews.  Once again, we were not disappointed.  Made a reservation through Open Table and were seated at a great table on time.  The restaurant was very busy due to the Eric Clapton concert later that evening.\n\nOur server (Rick?) was awesome - perfect balance of knowledge, presentation and attention.  Chips and salsa were very good.  I had the Vida Chicken and my wife had the Lump Crab Nachos.  The chicken was good + although the queso was a bit much.  The crab tacos were a perfect small meal for my wife.\n\nNice, fun experience with good food, service and atmosphere.
1;I was debating on whether to go and check this place out, having read good and bad reviews. My dad had gone and said it was great, large menu and good food.  We went this past Saturday and it was just average in food.  Service was terrible and the waitress had absolutely no personality or real desire to be there.  Looking around, I didn't see too many smiles on the staff's faces.  Yes, it was busy in there and it was loud but just didn't have a good feel about it, despite the cute decore.  The banana muffins were really good but that's about it. My daughter and I both had upset stomachs afterwards. We won't be going again when there's other places that have better food, better service and more reasonable prices!
2;"I chose completely the wrong day to do this.  This would be a great day out for a wet and cold traditional Scottish Summer day. I of course planned our trip on a scorcher and had to contend with a very grumpy g missing out on valuable vitamin D.  \n\nSmudge loved walking into the rainforest and seeing all the butterflies doing their thing. She was fascinated by the cocoons and getting to see butterflies mid hatching was pretty impressive. Especially when some of them are the size of a side plate.\n\nAs well as the butterflies, there were koi, terrapins, a red footed tortoise and little grouse all roaming/swimming around. You get up nice and close to everything and if you manage to stay still might get a butterfly accessory. Although, not if you are a very excitable child hopping up and down squealing \""land on me, land on me\"" - funny that!\n\nThe highlight of our visit was the reptile house with snakes from little to thank goodness that glass looks thick large, lizards, chameleons, iguanas and wall of spiders.  There were also promises of a leaf ant colony which massively appealed to the geek in me and I was really disappointed to find all the rope ways and viewing points empty. Disappointed until I mentioned to one of the staff who explained that the ants had got bored and moved their colony, queen and all, and showed me where they were now displaying feats of amazing leaf lugging strength.  Not using any of the areas they were supposed to be and appealing massively to my inner rebel by living where they wanted to live.\n\nWe stuck around for one of the handling sessions thinking that there might be a chance of smudge getting to hold something.  Instead we were treated to a brilliant half hour talk all about some of the reptile house inhabitants and getting to hold a giant millipede, a dwarf royal python and a chilean rose tarantula.  The lady giving the talk was obviously really passionate out her creepy crawlies and she was brilliant with smudge encouraging her to leave her comfort zone and let the millipede legs tickle her fingers. \n\nI really want to give Edinburgh Butterfly and insect world more than 3 stars. We had a great time there and the staff were absolutely amazing. But the place looked really tired. I'm guessing green mossy mould grows pretty quick in the jungle like conditions but even taking this into account the place was manky. The honey bee walk area was in dire need of repair with broken screens, missing corrugated plastic from the roof and enough cobwebs to make you wonder how secure that wall of spiders actually was."
0;This bar is white trash. They over charged us but we tipped them$5 anyway just to take the high road. Then the weird looking bartender with the shaved head, Jen and the crazy looking one with fake...everything, suzi started yelling that we didn't tip the enough. They even had their ugly little mountain man posse follow us out to our car. My husband warned the guys to leave and told them if they tried to attack us he would defend us ...and that he did! A bunch of weirdos and complete morons.
3;"I have gone to that Big Fat Greek in Chandler mall a few times; and the food was good - ambiance was ok but it is totally different from the location in Mesa.\n\nMy boyfriend and I went on a Friday night, we had a restaurant.com certificate; figured we would give it a try. The service was exceptional, we ordered the meat lovers platter as well as the trio appetizers ( 2 types of hummus and baba ghonoush). The food was really good - a lot so we definitely had a lot to take home. \n\nAt the top of the hour the entire wait staff got together and all danced around the restaurant to a traditional Greek song - we really enjoyed seeing that as well as how engaging the staff was. From the sagi noki (flaming cheese) and the dancing - felt like you were part of the family and really enjoyed the ambiance.\n\nThe reason why it is 4 stars; most of the wines on their menu were not available but other than that this would be a perfect place to entertain family, friends or out of town guests."
3;Had a $50 GC from our hotel reservation website that was good for redemption at any store or restaurant at the Crystals center. Sooo we walked through debated between Mastro's, Beso, and Todd English. Glad we chose this place because it's probably the most laid back of all the choices. With Louis Vuoitton, Prada & Gucci stores within walking distance, this place was eerily normal. Wait staff friendly, set up table for six with no wait, dining room was pretty full. We ordered appetizers: onion rings (plate of like six HUGE seriously the size of a grown mans hand) and pot stickers. Both were reeeeally good. Two of us had the ribeye, they liked it. The rest of us had burgers- the Pub Burger is excellent, Fatty fries awesome. The chicken blt looked really good, but he didn't like the skinny fries they're infused with some sort of blue cheese seasoning. And the other person didn't care for her buffalo burger because it was drowning in blue cheese. Overall, really good!
3;I remember the first time i had White Rabbit, was when they had their truck at the foodie fest across from the Luxor. My friend and I had saw a bunch of recommendations of Yelp! Talk and had gone with what was recommended (Sisig Burrito) and had loved it ! Price was decent and the quality and size was great !\n\nThey are currently (12/04/14) soft opened. One of the workers has mentioned that today is their 3rd day they've been opened. CURRENTLY (as of around 3pm), we were told they were ONLY accepting cash but are trying to get their network back up as soon as possible for credit card usage ! \n\nTheir GRAND opening is set for December 13th. Current hours is 12-9 i believe but after they officially open, it will be 11-11, if not later. \n\nPork Sisig - deep fried pork belly, chopped pan fried medley of onions & jalapenos - (actually i just noticed the jalepeno part - not spicy at all) \n\nPork Tocino - sweetened cured pork, braised, wok fried to intensify its flavors\n\nBurrito - any meat encased in a flour tortilla along with garlic fried rice, swiss cheese, and a fried egg\n\nSo in this visit, i got the usual pork sisig burrito combo so i opt'ed for a pork tocino taco + drink. $8.95. As noted above, burrito consists of garlic fried rice, which is freshly prepared, very flavorful and fragrant. THOUGH i do recall the truck being more buttery ! pork sisig was nice and flavorful but with some tough bits here and there (its fried.. what you expect lol)... i wonder if i can request to have more jalepenos to be added in it? i found myself adding tapatio into it to add some spice but it didnt seem like the right kind of flavor for it T_T \n\npork tocino taco ... very small taco, maybe 3 bites (for me). the meat flavor reminded me between a chinese bbq pork in a bun + the dried shredded pork you put in congee. not a particular favorite but wanted to try anyway ! \n\nThe combos, you have a choice of the entree + a side + drink. the sides consist of either 1 taco, rice (white or garlic +$0.50), fries (omg they give you a ton of fries but they put a mix of salt + sugar on top... awkward imo), fried egg (2 eggs), pork lumpia (qty 6 but currently not available until grand opening), and coleslaw (vinaigrette based) \n\nIts a nice change from the usual chipotle or what not. Good location ! cant wait for Fluff Ice to come join them ! :D
2;stopped by tonight while in the area.  sitting in a strip-mall with a few restaurants the packing lot was PACKED, but the place itself was fine.  \n\nI got Spanakopita and a Gyro.  The Gyro was VERY tasty, packed with meat (could have had a bit more tzatziki though).  It was also a bit greasier than i am use to for a Gyro but i still enjoyed it.  The Spanakopita was also very good (but greasy).  \n\ni'm sure i'll go back if in the area and can't think of anything else to get, but won't go out of my way.
4;"I grew up in Jersey, the land of the diner, and I must say that The Cracked Egg brought me back to that townie down home diner I have come to live without since moving out of the Garden State. I recommend sitting at the counter, because you can get a great view of how the kitchen works and have great conversation with locals. We met a guy with an exotic car rental and I believe he thought we had moved to Vegas because this place is removed from the strip. It was awesome to hear his recommendations on what to order, his business, and what he loved about the area. We swapped Big Island stories and learned that we had seen one of his cars on the strip earlier in the week! I had a skillet with sweet potatoes, apple, bacon, munster cheese, and 2 eggs over easy. Everything was cooked just the way I liked it- I dare say \""like grandma used to make\"" except  my grandma never made me eggs- but if she did I imagine this is how she would do it. The husband got the green scramble which was packed with veggies, he asked for sweet potatoes instead of hash browns (extra charge but well worth it in our book) and they came out great. The coffee refills were free but we had already drank our coffee (which is how we functioned enough to find this place) and I had tomato juice. I will send any and all of my friends off the strip to find The Cracked Egg. Everything looked spectacular leaving the counter (pancakes the size of plates!!!!!!) and from the look of it, The Cracked Egg is pretty popular! All in all, if we ever find ourselves in Vegas again, we will be back!"
3;Pretty convenient for being in downtown AZ. Good prices for groceries and has most of everything I need. Also easy to access on a bike and provides parking for shoppers.
2;"Fulfilling my sons birthday wish of staying a night in the \""castle\"" for only $39 is a great deal. This isn't a 5 star luxury resort but it's not bad. I've definitely stayed in worse rooms that I've paid more for. The beds were comfy there was air conditioning and the bathroom was big and clean. While there was no bath tub or huge flat screen tv I think this room was good. And for $39 what do you expect. I would not be afraid to tell my family to stay here when they visit."
2;Definitely not the best, but sad to say, I've seen worse.   This hotel has the look of having bad plastic surgery.  Although remodeled, still feels worn out.   Still going through major construction in lobby with many amenities limited or closed.  Yet they have no problem not telling you this when you book nor do they offer any compensation on the bill.
1;I used to come to this bar before their expansion and enjoyed it. Since the expansion the quality of service has dropped, the prices have increased. I would have to say that the management of this place is horrible. They have a lot of tv's but if there are multiple sporting events going on they will not accommodate everyone. Really bad organization and service takes forever.
0;I don't understand why some people like this place so much.  We got a little sick here from one of the rolls.  We had only eaten a couple of pieces and told the server.  They still didn't take it off our bill (not cool).  \nIt seems like a lot of people like to sit at the bar and drink with the sushi chef. He speaks mostly Japanese but it makes them feel like they have Japanese friends. As any bartender will tell you it makes sense to be friendly with your regular drinkers.  However the drinks are more expensive than other sushi bars I've visited.  If you like Sake you can get it a lot cheaper at a Japanese market in Spring Valley (or even a wine store).  Then you can serve good sake in your house!\nThere are lots of better food and dining options in Las Vegas.
3;"This is my second dance with Primanti's.  The first was at the Pitt location, which has a better atmosphere in my humble opinion.  I had the #2 most requested sandwich, Cheesesteak.  I asked the waitress what was the most requested item and she said, \""You're drinking it honey.\"" pointing to my Iron City pint.  Which was $2.95 by the way.  God bless the Burgh.  \n\nSo the sandwich is as I remember.  Huge, but if you squeeze you can get your mouth around it.  I realized my second time around that there's a reason they can keep prices low.  There's not a whole lot of meat in the sandwich.  It's dwarfed by the coleslaw and the fries.  I'd also pass on the cheesesteak next time.  It was a square beef patty which didn't seem right and there wasn't a lot of flavor.  Would get pastrami next time for sure.  \n\nSo the sandwich and decor of this location would rate 3 stars, but the concept of a restaurant that serves you an oversized sandwich with coleslaw and fries on it for  around 5 bucks rates 5, so it equals out to 4.  This sandwich and chain are one of the reasons I love the Burgh so much."
0;FYI this place just went out of business due to health code violations! Sorry to see it go I really enjoyed getting my groceries from here! Not sure what the violations were but that's the story I'm getting!!!
0;Are you kidding me Dusty........\n\nI have attempted to change my address and payment information for several months, only to call each month and make another attempt to change.....\n\nI call today and find out that my insurance was cancelled over a month ago for non-payment.........WTF........Statefarm........Take care of YOUR customers and get rid of the flaky agents.........\n\neSurance........I don't need human error causing me problems......
1;Ok a new experience today - shopping Sunday morning and trying to check out there is not one checker at at a station. Looking around and trying to make eye contact with someone. It's been about five minutes and someone finally paged someone after I gave a wtf look to them....  What's up with this Smiths?
0;"I live about 30 minutes away from PoP's and the prices are a bit high, so we don't get there more than once every couple of months. I don't mind spending $10-$12 for a good cheesesteak, but I'm sorry to say this will be the last trip. They no longer use Amoroso rolls, but they kept the price the same. Everyone who is a cheesesteak junkie or at least from Philly knows that a REAL cheesesteak is made with an Amoroso roll. NO SUBSTITUTE will work. Either go back to using Amoroso rolls or lower your prices by $3. These cheesesteaks are NO LONGER the (PoP) Pride Of Philly. They are just like all the rest now.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: On PoP's website if you click on \""The Perfect Cheesesteak\"", here is what they say about the rolls (in part):\n\""..........Cheesesteak perfection begins with the bread. POP's bread is baked in Philadelphia by the world famous Amoroso Baking Company which has been in business since early in the 20th century. Of course, it costs a lot of money to buy bread in Philadelphia and have it shipped to Las Vegas, but we figure that the bread is such an important ingredient for the most delicious cheesesteak, that we insist on serving only the best..........\"""
4;"So I came back to Firefly with my two daughters to give this place a second try - and I've got to say, we were blown away!\n\nTo start, the service was wonderful, just as it was before. Every time we went through a glass of our drink, it was replaced almost before we even noticed! The waiters were so attentive, and always came in with friendly expressions. We were even able to meet the chef (James), who explained some of the concepts behind the dishes and entertained us. Everything was just perfect as far as service was concerned.\n \nAnd now for the greatness of it all - the food! We really enjoyed some of their signature tapas, such as the skewers with the grilled beef and shrimp (called Terra y Mare skewers on their menu), and the tomato soup with the grilled cheese sandwich (called Tomato basil soup on the menu). And let me tell you- that was no ordinary grilled cheese sandwich! It was simply amazing on its own, and definitely going on my list of favorites! The outside was crispy, the bread was so tasty, and the brie cheese on the inside just completed the deal. We will be craving it again, that's for sure. And for some other tapas that get noteworthy mention: the tuna-stuffed red pepper on a thin taro chip (called Tuna peppers), and the bacon-rolled dates in red wine sauce (called Stuffed dates). The Tuna peppers made any of our apprehensions about cold tapas disappear in an instant- It was tasty, it was fun, and it was wonderful to snack on! And perhaps best of all, it was unique. As for the bacon-rolled dates, you've just got to taste it to believe it- We weren't very fond of dates, until we tried this dish! And that's not to say that it tasted primarily like dates, but actually quite the opposite: it made us realize that it was possible to make dates appeal to people who weren't keen on them to begin with.\n\nAs a side note for fans of more traditional food: they make an awesome macaroni and cheese dish. You can't go wrong with it, and it's one of the best mac&cheese dishes we've ever tasted!\n\nAnd anyways, I think by now, you already get what I'm saying: the tapas here are excellent if you're willing to give them a fair try!\n\nAnd what I mean by that is: maybe not all of them will match your tastebuds, but you've gotta find those that cater to your taste. And with a selection as varied as that of Firefly, you definitely have a chance at finding \""the one,\"" or \""ones\"" in our case!\n\nAs you may already know: we didn't hit a home run the first time we went to this place, and even had a couple dishes fall through the second time: we didn't dig the spiciness of the spicy shrimp tapas (Camarones a la diabla), nor were we huge fans of the Padron peppers. However, with the fulfillment we received from the other tapas mentioned above, one or two tapas like these were mere bumps in our road to satisfaction.\n\nFinally, we got to taste their specialty Paella. And it was absolutely wonderful. The flavor of the tomatoes and peppers blended with the wholesomeness of the rice, and mixed with our favorite seafood, just made it an absolutely worthwhile dish, that we only wish we could fit into our stomachs. Quick tip: believe the menu when it says it could serve six.\n\nBottom line: Come with an empty stomach. Try as many items as you can. Leave as a changed person with a satiated appetite and a somewhat wider horizon, wishing you'd done it sooner. And that's all I have to say. Thanks for reading."
0;"Zero stars. (Located on Windmill & LV Blvd.) Simply needed some change for putting air in my tires (at the machine on their property). I was rudely answered by the woman at the counter, who I assume is related to/is the owner, \""you have to buy something.\"" Not about to get hustled so I put $20 into the slot machine and cashed out. She inpolitely tosses $20 on the counter. Not sure what the profit margin on the smallest item in the store is. Most likely it's a few cents. Ending business with my neighborhood gas station could possibly cost them hundreds if not thousands lifetime. \n\nOn the plus side, the lady at Chevron across the street was very nice and accepted my simple request with no problems. \n\nEven if gas is a few cents more across the street, I'll take my business there as they deserve it."
2;Associate was very nice and helpfull.  However they did not have the 1 item we specifically went there for, and she was unable to tell us when it would be back in stock.
2;Trying Delmonico was a last minute impromptu decision... My friend and I wanted to grab a quick bite before the rest of our friends arrived. We were underdressed/too casual (shorts/tank tops) to sit in the formal dining area so we just shared a steak at the bar. We started off with drinks which were good and strong. I ordered the Lychee martini which was really good, and I couldnt even taste all the alcohol I watched him pour into. We shared a bone in ribeye, medium rare plus. The steak was really juicy and cooked perfectly, but it lacked flavor... We had to ask for salt and pepper. :(  I don't know if I'd go out of my way to come back... Maybe if I stayed at Venetian and needed another quick bite again.
4;Had the bear dog, Scotch eggs, and on a separate visit I had the Moki dog, and my wife had the crispy dog breakfast. I have to say, the Moki is my favorite so far. It reminds me of a Sonoran dog like down in Tucson, very tasty. The crispy dog breakfast is also excellent. And I've never had scotch eggs before, but I highly recommend it as an appetizer. Overall great food and friendly service. 5 stars :)
3;I like this specific DMV because 95% of the staff actually works... Nobody is just walking around doing nothing. Which makes their service fast! And they are always friendly here.
1;***Monday Lunch review***\nNo crabs, no prime rib... not even cocktail shrimps...\n\nOur last day in Vegas so decided to try Wynn.  The hotel itself was beautiful and the buffet was decorated so beautifully it was pretty amazing.  Now, the food.  Aside from the disappointment of no crabs and prime ribs...the selection of food was just not there...  I mean it was so sad that my husband had a slice of marinated Kobe beef and couscous...  Dessert selection was small but good.  I liked the mojito cake.   \n\n* Ambiance = VERY beautiful...I mean it is one of the best decorated buffets we've seen before.\n\n* Service = bad.  Had to ask for everything...\n\n* Price = expensive for the selections offered.  We paid $24/person.
1;Have been here for drinks a couple times. Finally decided to try the food. After asking for a food menu and getting attitude we left for somewhere else. Sorry if our business was too much of a hassle for you.
2;It reminds me of Panera back home - as a matter of fact, there are undoubtedly ties - but their lack of Equal sweetener is a perplexing omission.  \n\nMore annoyingly, the employees at this particular location are absolutely cloying - circulating the room like hawks to clear away whatever plate or speck of dust they can find - often to the point of distraction.\n\nA good soundtrack - Neil Young?  Really?? - but the random internet downtimes and 30 minute restrictions simply make Wildflower a far better choice for my needs.
4;The Grand Lux Burger Melt is the best sandwich I've ever eaten!  Grilled onions, toasted bread, perfectly cooked beef, melty cheesy goodness, and.... wait for it.... thousand island dressing.  Mmmmmmm......
3;Despite my prior hum-drum experiences here, I went back yesterday, as I was in the area and was in serious need of a sandwich - nothing else was gonna cut it.  The joint was busy - surely a good sign.  And my main previous gripe was addressed - they were putting quite adequate quantities of meat on all of the sandwiches I watched being made, mine included.  I had ham, pepperoni & provolone on a white roll.  The ham was excellent.  FAR better overall impression than my previous visits here.  Still expensive, but with more meat this time, not unreasonable.  I dare say I'm now a fan and will be back.. we'll see if this was a fluke or perhaps my past visits were.
0;"First off, I am being generous by giving them a 1 star (...and because there isn't a ZERO star option!). \nYesterday, I had a screw in one tire that needed to be replaced and it had to be done that same day because I was traveling long distance today. I called to check if they carried my brand of tires and they said \""yes\"" but they would have to call me back because they had a line of customers. Over an hour went by without a call back and it was already 3:30pm, so I decided to just drive there. I waited in line for almost 15 minutes and watched employees either stand around or walk by. When I was finally helped, I was told that my brand of tires is a \""special order,\"" which I wish they would have said over the phone. At this point, I asked to simply put a black tire on the car because I needed it done. They were very behind and said it would take over an hour to change my one tire. After 90 minutes, I returned and saw my car up high, with no tire, and no one working on it. I asked what the status was and their response was: \""we can't find a tire.\"" Are you kidding me?!? So TWO hours (and lots of frustration) later, my one tire was replaced. DO NOT GO HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO LIVE THERE!\n**By the way, while I waited in line, I heard two other conversations with the response: \""we can't find your tires.\"" Seriously!?!? Do you people have a black hole of tires on site?**"
4;Johnny is awesome, the food is great, and at a very reasonable price. I love the homemade chips and the variety of salsas especially the hot stuff. Johnny usually has the food up in two to three minutes and it's fresh and piping hot. I highly recommend this place.
0;The Grind on Hayden is a disappointing facsimile of the Grind in Arcadia. In Arcadia, my experiences with the Sweet and Spicy burger, peppercorn burger, and mesquite wings were extraordinary. In the Hayden Grind this afternoon, mediocrity reigned as the barbeque burger lacked any essence of barbeque sauce, which was overwhelmed by the bland mozzarella cheese. The mesquite wings which Arcadia served plain were cooked less skillfully @ Hayden and covered with some superfluous orange-colored sauce. The onion rings were pretty good. The beer selection in both places is very good. I thought I had scored big when I purchased a groupon for the grind. Apparently, not so much. I'll drive to camelback next time.
4;"Rock \""N'oodles is officially one of my family's most favorite places to order from right now.  My three year old specifically requests it, and he doesn't even order off of the kids menu.  My favorite that we share is Sweet Home Alabama...yummy!!!  The owner is very kind and always delivers to our door when we order.  The food is delicious, the delivery service is fast and the food is always fresh.  I recommend Rock 'N' Noodles to anyone looking for something different, creative and delicious to eat."
0;If I wasn't forced to give a star, I'd keep it. Last night's dinner there was just thrown up into the toilet. But they had good lighting and comfy seating! There... That's your one star. I'm sticking with Buffet @ Asia. It may be darker, more cramped, and even look less clean, but I've never gotten sick there. That is all.
4;WOW!  As soon as you walk into this buffet it's amazing.  We went there for lunch while in Las Vegas running the marathon and were not disappointed.  The cost was reasonable ($21.95 for lunch), but well worth it.  Not your typical buffet fare, with selections I've never seen before.  And their desert section was awesome.\nI particularly liked the portion sizes.  Normally at buffets you portion sizes are so big you can't really just try a lot of different items, but here they are very reasonably sized so we could try something and not feel bad if we didn't eat it all.  Loved the mahi mahi and salmon and the make-your-own fajitas were great.  I would totally recommend this buffet to anyone.
3;They get very busy for lunch and as a result the food suffers.  I went there yesterday and ordered the chopped salad which is very similar to a more expensive version at Cowboy Ciao.  The corn was stale, no butter for my bread, and they were so busy it would have taken forever to get some.  I like Wildflower, but only at off peak hours.\n\nEdited to add that the founder of Wildflower read this review, reached out to me, and sent a full refund for our meal, along with a gift card.  He was open to feedback and asked for me to dine there again.  It was a very nice gesture, and I will keep on going there for lunch.
1;Played the Links Course for the first time and will not be back.  The greens on the front nine were in terrible shape, like putting on the fairway.  Started at 3:30 and still paid $32 for the round, overpriced.
4;Friendly staff, very helpful and great wine, what else could you want?\n\nPlease go here!
0;I wasn't sure how to respond to the owner's response on Yelp so I am posting this as an update to my original review.  I did try and take a photo with my Iphone when I got home but had trouble centering the photo to show the disparity and gave up.  I am sure you are a very talented waxer as evidenced by the numerous positive reviews.  I suspect you trying to juggle me and two other clients at the end of the day played a big role in what happened with my brows.  I don't really understand your statement about half my eyebrow being gone.  To clarify, the distance between the bridge and one brow is 1/8 and on the other side 1/2.  The hole is not huge but was not there before and the hairs were probably caught in the wax.  I did tell you they looked great, and with the quick glance I had in the mirror I saw clean and shiny brows that looked neat so I was out the door.  It was upon further examination when I got home that I saw how off they were.  I have been having my brows waxed for years and while they definitely were in need of cleaning up, their shape was good and there were no holes.  I truly believe based on the amount time you spent with me, this was a result of you being rushed.  I appreciate very much you taking the time to respond and I hope you will consider slowing down because rushing can lead to mistakes.  I see that you are considered one of the best and that is the only conclusion I can come to for why this happened.
0;"Hands down, one of the WORST nightclubs on the strip.\n\nLong walks up and down stairs just to get in, the douche-iest bouncers, the shitty layout, horrible bottle service policies...this list can go on and on about all the negatives but I'm sure I'd hit the character limit on this review. \n\nYes, this is the \""it\"" club in Vegas right now because it's one of the newer ones that books some of the best DJs...but it doesn't excuse them for being poorly run and staffing some of the worst bouncers. But let's face it...people are always going to go out of their way to get here, but just be forewarned that you'll be dealing with a crapton of douchebags. If you are going to go, at least make sure you work with Brian T (http://www.yelp.com/biz/brian-tickes-las-vegas) to get you in, because he is the only good thing about going to Marquee."
1;The husband and I were very hesitant in checking in after the reviews on  here. We purchased a Groupon they had for a very cheap price. We stayed here for the weekend after Thanksgiving and we even called another hotel on the way to Vegas in case this place was exactly how we read it was. The check-in was smooth the gentlemen in the front was polite. The lobby was clean. We liked that we were able to park next to the building we stayed in so that was a plus. The area is not so great but we were mainly concerned about getting our car broken into which we didn't. I did end up killing a small little spider by the door (inside) the hotel. We stayed on the second floor which was ok. This place is by an airport so you will hear planes either getting ready to land or taking off. I heard it all throughout the night good thing I'm not a very light sleeper but when I would wake up I can hear them all the time. Our stay was ok only one pool was opened not too bad since it was in late November and it was a bit chilly. Overall if your on a very low low budget stay here I guess. Maybe request the second floor so you won't get bug problems as much,  maybe??
0;Terrible food, small plates and way to expense, 5 pieces of gnochi for $17.
0;Terrible customer service the checkout has no idea what they are doing everybody who works here walks around with their head in the clouds no organization, no professionalism, no communication, I paid for grout and waited 45 minutes for them to get it from a pallet??!!! Good job 5 stars for the worst place to shop...
2;Great service. Good food. Had baked scallops. Reasonable prices
0;I never want to stay in this bed bug infested crap hole again. Line to check in took over 3 hours. Awful, just awful.
0;O.k when u go ask for Angela she took real good care of us the first night ... The third day omg it was horrible we had two different waitress to help us  cold coffee refills we had a hair in our food ask to speak to the manager we had to wait until we got the check to find out why the manager was never called a waiter name Terrance came to help us who said he was doing a favor ... Horrible service ..... Never again at this Denny next to casino royale..
0;"I was very unimpressed with my takeout experience. Ordered the food and they said it would be 15 minutes. Showed up nearly 20 minutes later and the guy at the front said he'd \""forgotten\"" to put the order in. Had to wait 10+ minutes more, with no apology. They forgot my larb salad, to boot. The coconut chicken soup was perhaps the most disappointing; yummy broth but NO chicken at all (only 4-5 mushrooms). We won't be back."
4;What isn't there good to say about Play All Day! Pet Care. She took perfect care of our two dogs and kept us up-to-date on what they were up to each day. We saw photos and they looked happy as can be. We had an ant infestation inside while we were out and Conni even took care of all that for us. Went way above and beyond what we expected! I highly recommend Play All Day! Pet Care for all your pet sitting needs.
4;"Early this year our blower unit up in the attic was vibrating so I called our home insurance co.  They sent a local hvac company who came and looked at the unit just to say it's working fine.  Which is a lie because the unit was literally shaking our house and inefficiently cooling our downstairs area.  He collected the easy $60 for the \""visit\"".  Fast forward 6 months and the ac and blower broke.  Called insurance again to complain and this time sent AMI to do the job.  Joe did an excellent job with our AC and blower unit repair.  He was very professional and did the job in a timely manner.  Now my wife and baby can enjoy the comfort of our home.  Thanks again Joe!"
2;Went to Genghis Grill to redeem a free birthday bowl and this was my 1st time at this location, I have to say the set up inside is nice.  \n\nWent to go get my bowl made, and when I got their a young man asked me what types of meats I wanted, and he was serving them into the bowl, and I thought oh, this is different guess he is putting my bowl together for me, and after he placed the meat into the bowl then he gave the bowl to me to finish up with it, which I did, just wonder why I wasn't able to put my own meat in, because I would have added much less than what I got haha. Even though I am a carnivore, I do love my veggies and I just feel Genghis just doesn't offer much in the veggie department. But they do have Udon noddles which I happen to love!\n\nMy lunch bowl was good, service was friendly, and glad to stopped by and added them to my lunch time list!
2;I usually write long reviews but I'm going to keep it simple. Don't believe the hype. This is nothing more than fast food Mexican. If you have been Carambas, it's exactly the same tihng except it has more hype and there is more seating. Otherwise, the setting, format and style of Mexican food is exactly the same.  Carolinas is good but I heard amazing things about this place....along the lines of Best Mexican in Phoenix and nothing could be further from the truth.  Again, it was good food but if someone served you this food and made no mention of Carolina's, you wouldn't be able to distinguish this food from several dozen Mexican style pseudo fast food eateries. \n\nThe salsa is also overrated. There is nothing special about it. Imagine if you took pico de gallo and regular runny salsa and combined the two.  That all this salsa is.  It's as if they poured the two into a vat and just mixed it. \n\nSure, if you live near this place or your work place is near it, you should certainly check it out. You will enjoy it but you will not be mesmerized by it. I would definitely not go out of my way to eat there or take people there.\n\nIn short: Highly Disappointed but still enjoyed the food.
3;Cheesecake only review!\n\nThe truffle cheesecake was flippin' amazing!!  Our group of 3 devoured that in a couple of minutes-mm just the right amount of fluff, sweetness, and sugar!  The blueberry was pretty good, considering I'm not a big fan of blueberries.\n\nIt's $10 for a huge slice, but it's well worth it.
2;When I visit my sister in the Phoenix area, she always wants me to pick up Mexican food for her and this place is very authentic and way above Taco Bell or Bakers or any of those places. The food is messy, but it has the real flavors and the prices are good. They have a drive thru and you can eat inside. I think there are two of them that I know of in the area.. and I think they may be connected with Alberto's (in Cali) which we all know has great Carne Asada Burritos!
4;This is the place to be. Formerly a different hookah lounge that's been remodeled and under new ownership. Nick, the owner, is one of the coolest! Great shisha, excellent service and awesome environment.\n\nWe ordered:\nFumari Chocolate Mint 5/5\nFumari Gummi Bear + Lemon Mint 5/5\n\nOverall one of the best spots to chill at or get some work done. I will be returning.
4;This is my favorite restaurant in Old Town. The food is great, the prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is great. Very chill vibe. I eat there at least once a month and the staff is always friendly. I love to take family and friends there. Everyone I have brought with me loves it.
3;After visiting the Imagines Exhibit Gallery, my daughter had this request for tiramisu.  Since I could never say no to her, tiramisu it is.  I didn't originally know where to go so I asked the people at the exhibit and they suggested that we come here.  \n\nLet's start with price.  I think you get a combination of Italy's prices, Venetian's prices, and the fact you're in a casino food court on the strip.  This means that everything on the menu cost a little more than you expect.  A 3 x 3 square of tiramisu cost over $5.  My daughter loved it and I had to see what all the hype was about.  I took one bite and it's not bad at all. It's spongy and has that amaretto/coffee taste. One thing I love about tiramisu is that cool and creamy texture once you get to the middle of your bite.  Yes, it's pretty good actually.  Only thing missing was one of their $5 coffee's to compliment it.
3;this place has a very cool layout. entering from the street, it opens up wide with a wrap around patio, lots of shade from structures and trees, cool foliage, and even a big duck pond with lots of ducks, swans, and turtles. \n\nwe were seated immediately and served some very tasty, crispy chips and 3 types of salsa's. i had 2 of the house margaritas which i thought were so good, they went down too easily. we split a green chile tamale appetizer, 1 each, and they were surprisingly very filling and packed with chiles. we also split a fish taco plate, which was mediocre and a little high priced for only 2 tacos with one tiny sliver of fish inside. \n\nthe black beans and rice were cooked well and had a great flavor. for out 2 plates, 2 margaritas, and 2 beers, we paid about 50 bucks with tip. our sever, poor guy, didn't smile once and although prompt, was obviously not happy to be at work today. \n\nwhen the folks come to town, we might have to venture out this way again.
2;I was tired of the same breakfast places over and over. I tried this and wanted to love it. However I am sad to say it was average on every way. I am left  baffled by the 5 star reviews. I had French toast which was semi hot when I got it. Espresso was served semi hot. My girlfriend selected the lobster omelet and it was okay, but not magical as implied in other reviews.  \n\nReally an average experience with average food.
0;The food did not taste good and the service wasn't good at all and it was the longest wait! And the manager toughed the trash and the trash cans then touched cleaning supplies then started touching peoples food without washing her hands! And she wasnt wearing gloves! This was the worst burger I have ever had! Atleast the manager didn't touch my food!
1;My girlfriend and I had a great time there. This place is really old school but I like that old school look.  \n\nWe enjoyed our time in the pool and had the pleasure to have meet a grandfather who was taking care of his triplets, while the wife and daughter were gambling.\n\nThe only thing we did not like was the fact that the refrigerator was not working and the elevator seem that it was going to break down.\n\nThe people that work there in all departments were very friendy  \n\nWe will come back again!
1;Not my favorite place at all **go to frys electronicks if you can**   the employees always seem to be un-familiar with their store layout and would rather walkie talkie to someone else to help you.  I think their hope is that you will just get irritated and either leave the store or walk around until you help yourself.  The prices are higher for items im familiar with than for example frys electronics, and you definetly will get better service elsewhere.
3;This little place was a bit nicer than the average salon. The decor was a more updated than the cheap salons and most of the staff spoke pretty clear English, especially one gentleman there. \n\nI paid $40 before tip for a full set of white tips with clear acrylic fill, including removal of my old acrylics. The woman did a great job and took time to file each nail just right.\n\nI would give them another star if it didn't have to wait a half hour and if the prices were a tad cheaper.\n\nAlso, don't forget to bring cash because you get a discount with a punch card!
0;Usually before I buy anything I check out the reviews and for some reason I guess a hunch I stupidly didn't this time and that was a mistake. I bought the groupon a month ago and made an appointment for tomorrow. I get a call today telling me that they wont make it tomorrow. Apparently they only have 1 technician in the entire company and he quit. It's going to take another 3 weeks to train another. I'm sorry 2 months for this? I really should of read the reviews. What a waste of my time.
2;The Kona Grill at the Chandler fashion mall is of standard quality to say the most, the service and setting of the resturant is of good quality. However on a Saturday night expect to be bombarded by underage kids running wild and being dropped off right in front. The Kona grill offers perhaps a better setting for a lunch-in.\n\nThe menu is of standard taste an quality of which the calamari, Yamada roll, and checkerboard roll where ordered and served in a timely manner.
2;This place is very very decent. I would stay here again for sure, but I wouldn't be over the moon about it. \n\nPrice: $200/night during the off season, at best\nAmenities: standard\nAccess to the strip: very good\n\nI came here because they let me stay three nights free on condition that I sit through their 2-hr pitch on timeshares. I would suggest this route. They will try to shame and bully you into a time share, but just stay strong. Then we got free entrance into Marc Savard's comedy hypnosis show (pretty good) and the Planet Hollywood Spice Buffet (never seen anything so terrible). \n\nThe bartenders are cool. The pool is disappointing at 3ft deep, but there's nice places to sit if you're into that. \n\nStaff are courteous. The place is clean. It's not exotic, but it's a sweet contrast to the Econo Lodge. And it has direct access to Planet Hollywood's shopping center. This is not the Bellagio or Cosmopolitan. But you might as well stay here anyway.
1;Great food, everyone loves it.  But if you're buying a gift card, shouldn't the purchaser get the reward points?  After all, the restaurant is getting their money instantly and a large percentage of gift cards never get used.  Why would I ever want to buy another gift card there if I don't get anything out of it?
1;"One word; gross. This is not Italian food - it's Pittsburgh italian food. The ravioli is not fresh - how difficult is it for a restaurant to make fresh ravioli? The decor is tacky. The wine list is lacking. I could rip this place apart after only one disappointing meal, but I'm not going to waste my time. In short, avoid this place! You can do much better in your own kitchen!"
3;Wow, love, love, love Bachi Burger.  We started with the steamed duck buns. . . I have never liked duck until NOW.  I would eat these yummy puffs of delight EVERY Day!  I had the salmon burger, he had the cod burger and both were fantastic.  THIS is how any fish sandwich should taste, PERIOD!  Fresh flavors and seafood with sauce that doesn't over power the flavors.  \n\nWe like Bachi Burger so much we went back again today, I had the crab cake burger, he had a house burger.  The crab cake was light and fluffy, with nice lumps of crab, the chutney it is served with compliments the crab perfectly and leaves a spicy/sweet taste in its wake.  Mmmmm!  The burger he ordered was perfect, I have never had a better burger, REALLY, never.  Bachi Burger is doing it right, you will pay for the quality and fresh flavors but it is sooooo worth it.  ENJOY, I will be back next week!
1;"There's a truth about some restaurants that we sometimes don't want to acknowledge. Like Chotchkie's, the fictional restaurant from \""Office Space,\"" sometimes people come to a restaurant for the atmosphere and the attitude. Never mind that the food is astonishingly mediocre.\n\nHate to break the news, but Chuy's is the Chotchkie's of Tex-Mex restaurants. Lots of kitschy atmosphere, plenty of chirpy attitude (seriously, some of the waitstaff here act like they're spending the last few months of a prison sentence at a halfway home), and the food is simply very bland. And Tex-Mex should NEVER be bland. \n\nLook, I don't dislike Chuy's, but it feels a lot like what you get when you go to a joint like Chili's or Outback; a so-called \""authentic\"" and \""real\"" atmosphere that's anything but. For what they're charging you - no kidding, this is some seriously expensive Tex-Mex - you're definitely not getting your money's worth. \n\nYou're better off at La Unica at Indian Trial or Three Amigos off Central Avenue. You'll get a better dining experience, and you won't be bombarded with kitschy silliness that borders on obnoxious."
0;Had a horrible time staying here. The carpets are stained and the rooms smell funny. The staff was very unfriendly.  The hot tub was broken. The pool room was ice cold. The apples at breakfast had  rotted. I believe that there may have been a heard of elephants  bowling on the 3rd floor. There was no cable tv only a few channels and the DVD player did not work.  I gave a star because she did let us check in early.
2;Typical fast food experience. Go through the drive thru, order food, receive half of the food you ordered correct, pay amt and leave dissatisfied. The highlight of the experience was the soda because I was craving carbonation and the Philly burger was okay. Not trying to go all in on the employees but if you are working in this line of work, selective listening isn't going to help you.
3;What a beautiful setting to eat breakfast in.  That's why I'm giving it four stars.  The eggs were yummy, the potatoes a little dry, and the coffee I would have preferred in an actual mug instead of a throw-away cup, although it did allow me to carry it around as we roamed the beautiful farm after eating.  What a nice way to spend a weekend morning.
2;Didn't stay here, but enjoyed the light show outside.  It starts around 7:30 pm and goes every half hour until 1 am.  It is worth grabbing a seat on the terrace outside registration and having a drink, and watch the show for a few rounds  The drinks are expensive and not well made, and the bartenders were sorta surly, but I tipped well and they came around to our side, plying us with snacks and stronger drinks.  I won $130 bucks on slots, yay!   If you sign up for a Wynn card you get 10 bucks free play, then when you hit 25 points you get another 10 bucks if you spin some stupid wheel at the red card desk, so have all your friends play on your card to get the 25 points so you can get 20 bucks free gambling money.  Sweet!
4;Good service and great food.  Came in 15 minutes before closing. They seated us wright away without complaints.
1;Ate at Garcias a few times over the years.  Up until tonight, it has always been a dependable place to get some good food with some good service.  We arrived later in the night and the place was maybe 40% full, but still had to stand up front waiting for anybody to greet us or seat us for a few minutes.  \n\nI ordered an iced tea that ended up tasting odd to me, but the server was nice about getting me something different.  However, the half drank tea cup remained on the table, stacked on two small dirty plates and were still on the table when we left.  \n\nThe salsa and beans (which every table gets) were eaten quickly, but we were never asked if we would like more. Several tables around me were asked several times if they would like more.  The food was tasty and the restaurant was clean.
4;It's a great place to lounge after a great night in Vegas. Come around 8:55a, right before the pool opens so that you can get a free chair. Great music and great vibes all around and you can see the strip!\n\nDon't forget to wear some sun screen!
1;The food was all right however, the service was weird.. Everyone looked pissed. NO ONE welcomed us or made eye contacts for good 2 minutes (out of one waitress and the two sushi men). They just glanced blankly at our direction. I felt awkwarded out by the silence. \n\nThe waitress (older Korean woman) pointed to a table so we sat there. We ordered something a la carte and two waters and the waitress gave us a weird vibe like she was pissed. The entire meal, she didnt come along to check on us or give us refills. She at one point got cranky with a couple that came in so they actually walked out. When they walked out, she blurted something out to the sushi men. Let's just say i know their language pretty well.....n what she said was not nice. I have  gone there a couple times n they actually talk smack a lot about their customers. Some customers seem like they come there a lot based on what i hear from the conversation. What disloyal people?? It made me mad. \n\nI felt uncomfortable the entire time. Maybe i should have gone elsewhere when i first felt the weird vibe when i walked in. Another family walked in and out too during our meal. It was really weird there. I would not go back.
0;I am a HUGE fan of chipotle, but man this location is the worst. I went with friends and we got Horridly sick. Beware
4;I found Diamond D through Yelp.com and hired him to install a new bath fan. He was so polite and even EARLY! Can't remember the last time a handyman was so punctual!. He finished the work and was even nice enough to install a towel rack last second. A HUGE plus for me was that he even texts which is super helpful. We will remember him to use in the future!
2;"In short: I got a run of the mill Chinese meal here, but I didn't know to ask for the \""real\"" menu. Service was excellent for as busy as they were.\n\nSo I went to the Chinese Cultural center on Sunday, Chinese New Year, looking for Chinese culture. I found a street fair with such cultural gems as a booth for Wells Fargo loans, and one selling \""crazy Chinese hats.\"" I wanted authentic food, and the booths selling egg rolls and stuff from the market buffet were pretty much the opposite of what I was there for. So my date for the event and I decided to try one of the Chinese restaurants at the center, and I chose Szechwan Palace because I was in the mood for something spicy.\n\nThe place was packed, which was to be expected. Since a good portion of the conversation I heard taking place was in Chinese, I was hopeful that that this would be an experience similar to what I'd get in Seattle's international district. I knew that wouldn't be the case when I saw the menu, which was basically the same menu you'll find in any americanized Chinese restaurant.\n\nSo we just ordered the Szechwan dinner for two. Hot & sour soup, crab rangoons, fried rice, general tso's chicken, szechwan shrimp, and a rice based desert that I forget the name of. I thought all the dishes were decent, but nothing had the spice I expect from Szechwan cooking.\n\nAfter consulting Yelp, I know now there is a \""real\"" Chinese menu here. That explains why this place could be so popular with native speakers. I wish I had known. This review reflects the disappointing experience I had with the menu I was presented with."
2;I got kicked out of here for walking into a mirror. True story.
0;Yuck.  The food here is gross.  The $4.99 price for the dishes is a gimmick.  The portions are small.  For about $2 more, you can get a full size dish at other places.\n\nWhat is that weird smell in the restaurant?  It's certainly not food.\n\nWe ordered the beef chow fun which tasted like a greasy blob of paste.  The won ton noodles tasted bland and the meat inside the won-ton tasted weird.\n\nThe rice porridge (con-gee) with chicken tasted funny.  How do you mess up on that dish?  The chicken had no flavor.\n\nMy brother had the soft udon noodles and when he bit into the noodles, it had a funny crackle.  Like a delicate shell being crunched.  Do you catch my drift?  He was afraid to spit out what he was eating and just gulped it.\n\nThe food here is not authentic.  It is below average and tastes like garbage.  There are much better places to eat.
0;"I wouldn't stay at Planet Hollywood again nor would I recommend anyone to stay there. From the second we arrived to the hotel, service was slow. We waited for valet and for a bellboy to come get our belongings. When I got to the front desk to check in the lady told me they didn't have anymore 2 queen size beds available but had a king size available, (yea with four girls, sure), I paid for TWO QUEENS !! The lady finally found one and, after she did they had the nerve to charge us $16 to check in early, which I've never heard of a hotel doing if they have a room available. I've stayed at 5 star hotels and NEVER been charged for an \""early check in.\"" \nAs soon as my friends and I walked into our room it reeked of weed. We called the front desk to complain (it took about 15 minutes to even get through) and they said they couldn't give us another room, (which they could've because the lady at the first desk asked us if we wanted to upgrade) they also said they would send someone up to spray. Well, that never happened! The room smelled like weed all weekend because the room next to us was blowing it into our bathroom vent. We called again to complain Friday night that it was an issue, so the hotel comped our $16 early check in fee (something I feel we shouldn't have been charged in the first place) and sent Security up to look into it. Nevertheless, every night weed blew into our vents and smelled up our room. \nPlanet Hollywood's inability to remedy the situation left a bad taste in my mouth. On top of that, the rooms are really small, almost outdated even. I've stayed in a lot of hotels in Vegas over the years, from 5 stars to 3 stars and this is by far the worst room I've stayed in. The only thing PH has going for them is Britney Spears!! The star is for Britney Spears."
4;I have to admit I went a little nuts the first time I tried this store out.  I was looking for some unique spices for a new 5 alarm chili recipe and boy this place delivered.  \n\nIt is a cute little shop with sections around the store for various types of spices like Baking or BBQ etc.  The folks working there are super helpful and will make sure you find what you are looking for.\n\nI went back a few days later for some nutmeg.  Replacing my weird generic store bought brand with the real thing felt AWESOME.  \n\nThey have a refill policy too where you get a discount if you bring in your previously purchased bottle of spice, they will give you a discounted baggied refill.  Very nice!
2;We had eaten at the one in Miami and Chicago.  Great food great experience.   So we expected the same quality at the Vegas location especially considering the fact you are spending at least $100-125 per person for your meal.   This is a very expensive restaurant in Vegas so get ready.  We both had their surf and turf special and the filet was dry and flavorless even though it was medium rare. (and choice not prime) The fish portion was good but small.  The corn special was pretty good as was the bread.  The salad was ok nothing special.   I would not go back as there are many other good steak or seafood places that are not that expensive.
2;Howzit!?\n\nDecent Thai food. Average atmosphere. Good service.\n\nNotable dish: Beef Panang Curry, Garlic Pork with Tofu.
3;In a nutshell:  a unique bar, but very, very pricey.\nPros:  This place is stylish, and the concept of having shadow dancers behind the screen was unique, but has been imitated.  \nCons: You can see the stage from the casino outside, so you don't need to buy $18 drinks and overpriced appetizers to hang out in here.
1;Oh Dear Lord!  Can I get a Xanax?!\n\nFor us parents this is a necessary evil.  Chuck E Cheese's, in my opinion, as a whole have gone downhill over the years.  It's just not quite what it use to be.  The now robotic Chuck E. makes the experience a little less special and the pizza leaves even more to be desired than it use to.  Nowadays, the staff can make or break your experience.  That and the parenting skills of the other patrons.  Sure, this is a place for your kids to be kids but it's not an excuse to let your child do as they please and run around screaming like an animal.  Do us all a favor and parent your child(ren).\n\nWill I return?  Absolutely!  I know the joy that my daughter gets from this place and I couldn't deprive her of that.  Will we ever have another birthday party there?  No way!  Incredibly overpriced and there's not enough Advil in the world!  The package 'upgrades' add dollars upon dollars to your final bill just to award the children with more plastic trinkets that are broken before the end of the party.  If they survive beyond the party, they are in the trash within a week's time.  \n\nI think the staff is hit or miss here and I think they could do a better job at keeping the place clean.  I also think they need to better position the staff at the front because on countless occasions I've had to stand at the counter waiting to be served.\n\nWhy don't you serve beer!?!?!  Other locations do and I knew that would be the only thing to get me through a 6 year old birthday party!  Talk about disappointed!  What are you doing to me?!?!?  Selling beer is like selling sanity to all of the dads in the place!  Easy money!  You're losing out on so much business!  A golden opportunity to gain additional revenue.  Get it together Chuck E.
0;Today just was not a good day for Coffee Bean. The lady didn't let us finish ordering and my husband had to ask her if we could add another drink since she didn't ask if we wanted anything else. She repeated the order and got it wrong. My husband corrected it and then when we got to the window, she still got our daughters drink wrong. Ugh! Luckily my daughter is a trooper and just kept her wrong drink. But to end it, all of our drinks were completely watery. Ya'll sucked today!
0;I was a bit dubious of this choice when I saw it but what the hell, outdoor patio, right? This was arguably the worst Mexican food that I've ever tasted. My enchiladas were lousy (I felt like the sauce was made with tomato paste) and even the high end margaritas tasted like a sweet mix. The waitstaff also seemed to be a bit out of it. \n\nI think the lesson learned is don't eat Mexican in Madison, WI.
1;"My group dined here as a break from all the baller restaurants and buffets. But this place did not live up to my Wynn standards.\n\n- Pizza was difficult to cut. The thin crust was not crispy, but was tough and chewy\n- Calzones were.... interesting. Sauce is served on the side, which I wouldn't mind, but the inside is just loaded with cheese. I didn't appreciate the imbalance; the rest of the filling flavours were overwhelmed by inordinate amounts of dairy.\n- Salad was inadequate. Poorly adorned and looking like something I could have picked up at the gas station. I will admit, that the Balsamic vinaigrette is delicious, but I always like balsamic.\n- Seating large parties in this restaurant is difficult because there were only small round tables available during our visit."
3;"Yummmmm. \n\nWhen I worked down the street I had the opportunity to eat here a few times for lunch. My work paid for it so it was a bit more than I would normally spend for a lunch but it was so tasty that I've went back since and paid for the food on my own dime (and without a Groupon, can you believe it!) \n\nAs stated by my first word in the review, the food here is really good. The menu is for sure trendy and filled with all the buzz words that 5 years ago nobody would understand. Don't matter though. Also being right near the \""waterfront\"" the interior is really airy and the whole place has a nice ambiance to it. \n\nI remember the service being a slight bit slow if your trying to get in and out and back to your office on your hour lunch. If you have the time, I could see myself hanging out with friends and letting the conversation continue until the lunch crowd has just about cleared out."
1;"Update after recent visit: while I still find the food very good I have to downgrade my previous rating due to price increases and poor service. \n\nRecently I noticed that beginning with your second bowl of chips you are charged. I asked the waiter about this and he said it was because they found that they were wasting too many chips. To me these are throw-away items at a Mexican restaurant anyway. \n\nIt also appears that their dinner pricing has gone up with the food quantities staying abou the same. One comment in my group was \""this is Chandler, not Scottsdale! Why are the prices so high, especially for Mexican food?\""\n\nI have also been experiencing mediocre service. Recently we were in after the lunch crowd but before the dinner crowd and really got poor attention / service. Particularly since the place was relatively empty.\n\nShape up El Zocalo or you'll find yourself a victim of this recession. That would be a shame because Chandler could really use a more upscale Mexican restaurant with REASONABLE pricing.\n\n===========\n\nI don't know why but Chandler is really hurting for great Mexican food. Considering that, this place rocks. My favorite is the Chicken Mole. You cannot find that on most menus period and this is definitely authentic. I also judge a Mexican restaurant on their rice. Most rice is horrible, this place has very authentic rice (I use my grandma and aunt's cooking as baselines). \n\nNext is as mentioned, the ambiance. Great place, particularly when the weather permits you to dine outdoors.\n\nAs noted, this is not a cheap Mexican joint. You would think you could find great Mexican food at cheap prices but you'll have to go to El Rancho or the  Food City restaurant (name escapes me) for that."
4;Adele is fantastic! \n\nLovely person, lovely stylist, lovely work. Salon is eclectic chic and clean, and the music is always intriguing. She's the first person I've let cut my hair in years (I'm a do it myself-er), and she didn't disappoint. And my color is to die for.\n\nxx.
2;I was driving around this morning trying to fend for food.  I was tired, barely caffinated and needed something to eat, and quick.  Its been a while since I've been inside a Brueggers, so I thought it would be different and I came here.\n\nThe place is okay. Kind of a weird setup, but it was alright.  They had a weird selection of bagels.  Im traditional with my bagels, and dont care much for some of these crazy concoctions that they have these days.  I know some folks like sundried tomato coffee organtic free range flavored bagels, but not so much for me. (no such bagel flavor, but its the eccentric part that gets me.)\n\nAnyways, I just wanted something in the tummy.  SO, I ordered a smoked salmon flavored bagel with capers, tomatos and plain cream cheese.  On an onion bagel. (dont worry, I was dining alone, so no worries about my poor breathe afterwards. LOL.)  \n\nBut it got confusing because the girl that helped me told me to go to the register and pay, and my order would be up shortly.  I think it was because the 2 parties ahead of me, and both were ordering enough bagels to feed a small army, part of phoenix, and well, it was taking forever.  So, I went to the front of the line and paid.  I told the register girl what I had ordered, and she wasn't sure what I was talking about, so I had to point to the menu to show her what I ordered.\n\nThe bagel itself was tasty, but was a bit heavy on the cream cheese.  I forget that bagel shops put so much on, so I will have to remember to ask for less creme cheese next time I go there.  I will most likely be back, but not as often as I would like, since it was just a-okay.
4;This is one of my favorite restaurants! The bruschetta is amazing. My favs are the brie & apples with fig, and the prosciutto with figs & marscapone (so good!!). And we really like the butcher block, so many yummy things to eat!
0;"I would never rent from this company EVER again. The ladies in the office at The Monarch on Coolidge st in Phoenix are completely incompetent. My hot water was shut off without them letting us know, and they just shrugged and said sorry. When signing the lease we were promised a full months rent free, which we never got because \""we could only give it the day you checked out an apartment\"". Our lease had to be rewritten twice because they didn't take down all the information we provided properly. And when I called MEB personally to speak with someone about my issues, I was forwarded to an answering machine. We were told the highest combined utility bill during the summer would be 250, it's October and my bill is 280. At this rate I should have never moved from my old apartment and I will never rent from Meb again."
1;"I got the Beef Ramen to go. \nThe wait wasn't too long and the restaurant did seem too packed for a Sunday morning. But the ramen was really bland. I didn't really like much about it other than it was hot and I was in need of some comforting soup. \nIt was however, definitely pricey; I believe my total for my to-go ramen was $18.\nWTH? I was completely disappointed with the lack of quality since the rolls that they were making while I was waiting for my food, looked SO GOOD! Maybe I should have ordered a roll instead. \n\nThe restaurant however is roomy and clean. It would be unfair to rate them one star since the only thing I tried was the ramen. But I wasn't too impressed in their service either."
1;Place is ok if you're looking for a cheap price.  Food was ok..I had better.  Not that much food selection for a chinese restaurant.  Service was extremely slow.  I guess u get what u pay for.
0;Sad to say this wasn't the food that caused me to give a low score. Went to Food Truck Friday in Southend and waited about an hour and a half to try their food (which I understand is normal & was not upset abt this). When we were able to order, they had run out of all of the sides that were to come with the purchase of the entrees. When asking if we would still be paying full price, the lady at the cash register told us yes and that we could go to another food truck if we didn't like that. I have been in customer service my entire life (for over 15 yrs thus far) and had never had someone show such apathy. She made no attempt to substitute anything and actually acted as if we were the rude ones for asking.  I then saw her mouth to her cooks abt the f**cking b*tch in the line not once but multiple times. The fact that we didn't get a measly side was not important to me, the way she handled it was absolutely disgusting.
0;Service here is absolutely horrendous. We came early for a wine and canvas event. The server that was scheduled to work the event started complaining loudly to her other co workers about us coming early..jeez. I'm sorry we wanted to come early & have some appetizers. Rude? I couldn't believe the attitude we recieved from this establishment. The bartender rushed us through ordering our drinks & seemed annoyed with anything anyone ordered. I felt as if they didn't want us here & that were inconviencing them for wanting to spend money. I hope that they were just havih a bad day because its a real shame to think that a restaurant as nice as this employs such rude, un-welcoming staff
3;"First lets review the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant was definitely a 4 Star experience. I had a New York Steak 18oz Medium Rare ($38) and it was just right. None of their entrees come with any sides but I highly recommend the Mac & Cheese or the Cajun French Fries. They're $8 each and the steaks are definitely worth it (common you're already paying this much to eat at the buffet, don't be cheap). The first time I was here I tried the 24oz porterhouse as well and it was great ($42).\n\nAdditional Information\n\nThis place is usually packed during the summer. The outdoor view is amazing. Everyone is dancing and the music is usually \""bumpin.\"" Bartenders here are great as well. The ladies usually order a \""Witch Doctor,\"" pretty much a giant Mai Tai with more liquor in a giant Goblet. It comes with dry ice and has all the cool effects. \n\nIf you haven't eaten dinner yet and plan on going to the lounge anyway, eat here to save the cover charge. I've been here 4x and I believe the cover charge ranges from $15-20 (depending how busy it is). I do not recommend coming here during the winter season."
4;"Fantastic beer selection & the food was great. With 31 beers on tap this place is for serious beer lovers. They even have 5 wines on tap. The food was great; the wings had 3 different sauces for dipping. The service was prompt & friendly. I will definitely go back!"
0;I've been screwed twice on sessions I bought from this place! I've trained at this gym off and on for a year and use to love the workouts but apparently the gym is under new ownership and now my sessions that I bought are no longer good. I can't blame that on the new owner but this is ridiculous and I won't be returning or recommending anybody to go here.
4;Such a beautiful campus.  The art in the museum was of an assorted variety.  There was pretty, thought provoking, and fun art of all mediums on display.  \n\nIt was a very entertaining night and I had a lot of fun with the visual feast Yelp and the musem provided. The building itself reminded me of the movie 'The Labyrinth'.  I was holding my breath waiting for David Bowie to pop out as I made my way throughout the building.
1;"After arriving late to Postinos for the Board and Bruschetta night, and facing a long wait, we decided to check The Henry out. It was pretty busy when we arrived, and told the wait was 30 min. After 40 min, hanging out in the nice coffee shop there, I went to the hostess to see about our table. They said it was ready, which I then wondered at what point they were going to tell us.\nAfter sitting, we asked for water. They brought lukewarm water with no ice in pint glasses. Ok, maybe the ice ran out, they're busy. \nI was super hungry and decided to order the Diner Burger. However, when it arrived it didn't have grilled onions, as advertised. Just lettuce, tomatoes and a smattering of 1000 island dressing. Also, the patty was a well-done, \u00bc\"" hockey puck. The fries however, were great, but came with only a half mini-cup of ketchup. Maybe they ran out along with the ice. \nSo I got to experience, for the 1st time in my life, the experience of sending something back. I always thought they would spit in my food, like in the movie Casino, so I've never had the balls to try it. But hey, it probably would have been an improvement for the super dry, burnt burger. As a comparison, the Arizona Snowbowl cafeteria burger is better, but by a very slim margin.\nA manager came over and said they were trying to improve their menu. I opinioned that an In'n'Out burger was similar to theirs, but four times as good.\nAfter ordering instead the Gemelli and Black Truffle pasta, I was asked if I wanted any meat with it. Which probably was a warning sign since the dish included homemade bacon. When the dish arrived it was great, but only had 5 to 6 slivers of ham (and no bread!) Also, it was tiny. Plates of pasta are much bigger in Italy, and they aren't exactly supersizing everything. Also, most important I was promised BACON.\nI gave this place 2 stars, because the wait staff was excellent, and they tried their best to make excuses for the food."
3;I have now been to Daily Dose 4 or 5 times and each time has been wonderful. Occasionally, you have to wait at the front for someone to acknowledge you and finally seat you but the short wait is worth it!\n  They serve breakfast until 3pm during the week and ALL day on the weekends. I enjoy the eggwhite wrap and always look forward to the large breakfast potatoes. My favorite part about breakfast is the homemade jam they bring with toast! I also love their burgers! The food is well cooked, creative, and delicious. \n They also have a wonderful happy hour that lasts until 8pm!  The specialty cocktails are clever but some of them are not well executed (too sweet).\n I love sitting at the bar or out on the patio. The service is always friendly and everyone seems eager to please. They put cucumber slices in the water which makes the tap water actually taste GOOD. These small attentions to detail really add up and make this place one of my favorites! I drive down from North Scottsdale just to eat here!
4;"Old reliable \""IHOP\"".  This location has friendly wait staff and the breakfasts are always well prepared and tasty.\n\nMuch better than other places like \""De**ys*.  Much cleaner and better quality."
2;We recently returned from a 4 day trip to Vegas for a combo business trip (for a trade show) and a bit of recreation exploring Red Rocks outside of the city. We initially choose Trump from the great rate we got through our show's travel agency. \n\nThere were many things we LOVED about the Trump. #1, it's a non-casino hotel which was very welcome after a long day of being inside the other hotels for the trade shows. No cigarette smoke or continual beeping of the slot machines. The smaller footprint of the property is another big perk. You can actually get from your room to the bar, pool, fitness facility or entrance in a few short minutes compared with over 15 minutes in other hotels. \n\nWe also had great interactions with all employees of the hotel, from the front desk staff, the concierge, the valets, the server in the bar area and the assistant manager. They were are genuinely friendly and interested in what we needed assistance with.\n\nWhat was not so great about the Trump was the mysteriously horrible housekeeping of our room. And I can't imagine it was just our room that was having virtually no housekeeping done during our stay. We were just one room of many within the hotel, our guess is that the housekeeping staff were either short staffed or lacked supervision to basic duties in each room. \n\nWhen we checked in we had 3 obvious lightbulbs burned out - and one seemed to have exploded with broken glass from the bulb on the counter underneath it and an electrical filament buzzing: 1 of only 2 lamps on the mirror in the bathroom. Hard to overlook. We also had only 2 hangers and our TV remotes didn't worked. When we went to hang the robe on the back of the door the hook fell off onto the floor. Ha! All not biggies, but combined it did require a call to housekeeping to get more hangers, new remote and lightbulbs replaced. \n\nThen on day #2 we returned to the room to discover that our room was only half cleaned. One of the three garbage cans were emptied, Our dirty dished in the kitchen were taken away, but not replaced and nothing was done in the bathroom at all - dirty glasses were still on sink, towels on floor, garbage can full. Again - we called housekeeping to get some glasses to use for the evening & morning.\n\nDay #3 brought absolutely no housekeeping at all. We returned to the room at 3pm and the room hadn't been cleaned. \nWe were trying to grab a quick catnap, but if housekeeping was coming by, we thought we'd wait. We called housekeeping, they apologized and said they'd be right up immediately. We took a book to the pool and 2 hours later returned to the room. Still no housekeeping. We needed towels, glasses, etc. Went down to the concierge, who called the manager on duty. He profusely apologized and gave us a bar credit. We only had a single night remaining, so that was the end of that. But all in all, for a hotel like the Trump to not be able to make up a room with basic necessities just seemed strange.\n\nWithout this experience we would have given this hotel 5 stars as the staff we interacted with were excellent and we liked the layout of the hotel. We've frequently stayed at much lesser level hotels, and housekeeping always seems to be able to empty garbage cans, replace towels and bring in new water glasses. This was the Trump. Very wierd, we did laugh as in the scheme of things it wasn't a biggie but unsure if we would return.
0;I was in Las Vegas for a business convention and arrived at the hotel midday on Friday. Originally, I was given a room on the 15th floor, but when I tried to turn in for the night at around 11pm, I was awakened by a group of shrieking hyenas in heat. Startled by the notion that I had checked into the local zoo and not the Hilton, I went downstairs to the front desk. On my way down, I was shocked to discover that the mild, classy hotel I'd entered earlier that day had transformed into a meat auction, where both the goods and bidders were walking advertisements for Ed Hardy and the discount section of Forever 21. After a brief chat with Ray during which I explained my bewilderment and my necessity for sleep in order to conduct the back-to-back meetings I had planned for the next day, I was given a different room, far away from the cattle auction. While this made my trip bearable, the disappointments from this so-called Hilton did not end.\n\nOn Sunday, I went down to the taxi stand at 10am for a cab and found myself in a line ten people deep. I waited over 15 minutes for a taxi. I refuse to believe that mid-morning on a SUNDAY is Las Vegas' rush hour. Apparently, the valet service wanted to sell a party bus to the unsuspecting guests, and a slew of cabs suddenly appeared only AFTER the Hilton charged $10/person to a party of 7 to rent a limo. Thanks, dude with glasses for making us wait in the heat while you lined your pockets. Truly, a class act one would generally expect from an establishment as well known as the Hilton corporation.\n\nIf you're a 20-something with poor fashion taste and questionable judgment in the opposite sex looking for a regrettable one night stand, this is the hotel for you. Otherwise, spend your hard earned money and precious vacation time somewhere else.
0;This is going to be a really short review.  Why? Because we didn't even get into the place.\n\nWe arrived looking forward to trying out the new place.  I knew it would be overpriced and the food only so-so ahead of time as its a tourist trap restaurant.  We get there, and its a 30 - 45 minute wait.  that was fine as it is to be expected.  We get our buzzer and patiently wait outside in the casino in the designated waiting area.  45 minutes go by and I go up to the hostess to check on our status and am informed that the kitchen was having issues and needed to be partially shut down about 20 minutes ago.  She told me it would be another 30 - 40 minutes.  Guess what we did.  We left.\n\nMy issue is simply the poor guest service.  If they are having issues such as this then people in the waiting area need to be informed their wait is going to be twice as long as they were told.  Senor frogs is not worth a 15 minute wait much less a hour and a half no matter what its location.  Won't be going back.
3;"This is a great venue.  Not too big and not too small.  We saw Puple Reign at their new home in the Shimmer Cabaret.  The show was excellent, as usual.  The Royal VIP tickets for the show I saw are located in an orchestra style pit at the foot of the stage.  The location of these seats seem like you'd be put in a position to look up, just a little too much.  \n\nThe Regular VIP tickets (at $69 each from online purchase) place you at a position above the \""pit people\"" and at the same level as the stage.  For me, these tickets were the best for seeing the show (an less expensive).  There is a bar inside and if you need to use a restroom, you have to trek across the casino for aways."
1;"Many people had said this place was an awesome place to study on their reviews, I pretty much got kicked out so I wouldn't agree. When I walked in it was empty and I had never been there before so I assumed it was more like a coffee house not table service. The girl explained it was table service and I asked if it was alright to study and she said \""it gets pretty busy on the weekends,\"" I was already there so I decided I might as well have breakfast.  The crepe was okay, not impressive by any means, I expected it to be warm and it was pretty cold. Then they made a point of letting me know that they had a wait list (even though there was clearly another person studying that was a regular) and brought me my check.  Never asked if I would have liked anything else, I was considering buying an americano (only because the coffee was so weak.)  Fun every once and a while brunch place, but don't go there to study or for the service."
3;Fish tacos here are fantastic!!!
1;Expensive veal scallopini tasted like it was from the OLIVE GARDEN. The service was a little slow. Overpriced.   They need a menu do over
2;"The smell that hit me when I walked into the Antique Market was so nauseating. It was that old thrift shop smell, it was so dusty in there, Sarah Marie and I started sneezing. I really was hoping she would change her mind and we could go somewhere else. We proceeded to the left corner of the mall to find a small \""cafe\"". We were greeted my a friendly staff member that led us to sit down. We ordered their famous citrus iced tea, the lady had told us they had become known for. We looked over the menu, it was small, and I was trying to figure out where the truffles n bacon name came from. We decided to just split something to test out the waters. We got the \""Pimp my Bruschetta\"" you pick 3 different toppings for your bruschetta, we went with Minty Peas with Bacon Jam (it was a few pieces of crumbled bacon on top), Babaganoush, and Grilled Haloumi Cheese with Sauteed Grapes. It came with a side salad as well.  They serve their dishes on a baking sheet, which is new to me. The bruschetta was good, the haloumi cheese was my favorite. We sat there for quite sometime with empty tea glasses, and we were still starving and wanted to order something else, but no one came around. It wasn't that busy. So after a good 15 minutes passed, we decided to call it quits and go somewhere else."
1;Slow service , too expensive , weird chairs with wheels on. I ordered a selection of Sashimi which tasted OK but not worthy of the price tab. Also had a beef noodle dish , very mediocre small amount of beef with huge lumps of tofu. Wine is $13 a glass! 6 of us ate there , nothing extravagant 2 wines , 2 beers $174 before tip. Yikes. Don't bother.
0;Had the steak and lobster tail, bowl of chowder and onion rings.  Pure garbage.  This food appears to be heated from frozen and tasted bad. I have had the ribs at this location before and they were good. Also had a hamberger here a few weeks ago, it was passable.  My bill came to over $30.00 for just me, for the above items.  Gold Coast should have stuck with their own restaurant which was always good. It appears to be all about Greed. P.S. the server tryed hard but of course has no control over the garbage coming from the kitchen.  I will not be back.
2;I had some time to kill this afternoon and was in the Downtown area looking for some lunch.  I was planning to catch a movie at the Epicenter and wanted some grup nearby.  It was a toss-up between Hooters and Champions and since I'd never been to Champions I decided to give it a try......\n\nWhen I first entered the place I stood by the hostess booth for about 5 minutes and nobody came to greet me or show me to a table...... or anything.  Then, some more patrons arrived and were waiting in line behind me.  This is when a waitress who was taking orders at a nearby table told is we could sit wherever we wanted so I decided to sit downstairs since the upstairs was crowded with kids.  So I make my way downstairs and sit a a table for about 5 minutes and no one notices I'm there.......  So I make my way over to the other side of the room and sit at a booth literally 3 feet from the bar and no one notices me........  The guy that was waiting on the booths was busy watching a college football game with some patrons..... So I get up and sit at the bar where the bartender quickly got my drink and took my order.  I got the classic burger with bacon, lettuce and tomato along with a side of fries.\n\nThe food came out fairly quickly.  The burger was very good!!  And so were the fries.  I really have no regrets about the food or the bartender, but the place is kind of dark and relaly is a '90s relic, I mean, they have a mural of LJ with David Robinson and BJ Armstrong among others.......  I understand having LJ on there but Robinson?  BJ?  Shouldn't Kemba and Big Al be on there?\n\nOh well, I thought the bill was fair.  I think it was $10 and change for a very good burger and fries with a pepsi and refill.\n\nI might visit again if I'm in the area and want a good burger, but I'd also like to see what else is out here.\n\nHappy Yelping!!
0;"I saw Whitney Padgett, one of the nurse practitioners. She was okay, but she seemed like she was in a bit of a hurry. In the past my Gyn has always talked to me about calcium, exercise, vitiamins, etc. Whitney did the bare minimum for my history and exam.  I was seen for a preventative exam and also had a small issue at the time. When I was billed it was for a comprehensive preventative exam as well as a level 4 visit. I didn't think one little test and prescription constituted a high-level office visit. When I called to get clarification, the office manager told me that their well woman appointment was just the two female areas- (without getting graphic). I'm sorry, but I am more than just two parts! They shouldn't be allowed to call themselves \""Women's Health Care\"" with that attitude."
2;I go to this Teeter most frequently.  They had a nice expansion in 2012, and the store is always clean. with friendly staff.  Everything is organized well and easy to find...etc. It's no Taj Mah Teeter, but it's closer to where I live, so it wins by default.\n\n\nOnly real complaint here is the parking situation can get messy at busy times, (Not even close to the daily sh*t show that takes place in the Metropolitan parking garage.), so keep your head on a swivel.
4;"I came in for a \""check - up\"" before driving to California to make sure all looked good. Took about an hour and a half in and out, and I was very thankful for their help & expertise. No charge was great (as I didn't need anything done thankfully) - I will be back for any future auto repair or maintenance needs. \n\nThank you!"
2;"Two points:\n\n*  A really great collection of vintage menswear--beautiful old overcoats and jackets--that is hard to find elsewhere.  And very good prices too.  Mixed in with that are some items of questionable value, but if you know what you want, you can make a great discovery here.  I'd give this place 4 or maybe 5 stars for the merchandise alone.\n\n*  I have to warn: my experience was in line with the other reviewers' reports.  The proprietor of this place was incredibly, unbelievably, theatrically--almost comically--rude and inhospitable.  From the moment I entered, he tried his hardest to insult me out of the store, and only the quality of his merchandise (and an incredulous curiosity) kept me from leaving right then.  Certainly, it was the worst 'service' I have ever experienced.  I would give it 0 stars if I could.  To quote him, I would certainly say of the proprietor, that he is a \""theater piece\"" (as he said to us of his overcoats, with obvious disdain).  To paraphrase Murray from A Thousand Clowns: \""he is not a man, he is an experience\"".  If you're looking for the thrill and humour of being randomly insulted by someone to whom you are trying to give your money, then it might be a good adventure to visit this place.\n\nSo, I am giving 3 stars overall: if you know what you want, you might find something really great, but beware of the store-owner--if you don't think you can take his insults with at least a bewildered sense of humour, it would be best not to go, or at least take a friend with you for moral and emotional support."
3;Wonderful, fresh food! We opted for the chef's menu based upon our dollar amount. Not used to this approach, but we tried it and was happy with the choices. Never saw the menu and should have as I would have enjoyed something novel. Good food, but common dishes.
3;Absolutely delicious food! Today was my first time at Nola today, and I will definitely go again. I had the Grilled Chicken Panini with the fries. The fries were incredibly good! The panini was yum too. \n\nThe only problem with this place is that the service is ridiculously slow. It has been a while since I waited 30 minutes after I ordered to have my food served. I don`t know if it is because it was a lunch time during a weekday, or if it is their usual routine. But I would recommend carving time on your calendar longer than the usual if you would like to go this place during the week and sit down to enjoy your lunch. \n\nHighly recommend it - will try the drinks next time which I heard are also really good!
3;Lotus of Siam is absolutely one of my favorite buffets that I've been to. Located in the heart of buffet capital of the US (i.e. Vegas), Lotus of Siam is definitely one that you should stop by to check out.\n\nRecommendation: The beef noodle soup is the most bomb soup I've had ever. So flavorful - especially with the different herbs, including cilantro. The beef is also extremely tender and delicious, and the noodles - thick rice noodles - go so well with the beef. I had about 3 bowls...soooo good.\n\nThe Pad Thai was also very good. The greasiness was not overwhelming like a lot of pad thai could be. The spicy-ness level was perfect - I always hate it when they assume that people can't take spicy-ness and make it mild and boring. The noodles were also nice and chewy, just like how I love my pad thai. \n\nThe red curry chicken is also pretty delicious, as well as the fried bananas. The rest of the offerings were good but not great, but make sure you eat the the beef noodle soup, pad thai and red curry chicken.\n\nThe price is also extremely reasonable - only $11 for the lunch buffet!
3;This was a great find. We were overwhelmed with the menu. We got the chorizo and carne nachos, the special of the day shrimp Mexicana, and two tacos. All was great! Service was great and they had beer wine etc. \n  The Habanero salsa was screaming and the tortilla's fresh and homemade. Boy I wish we could get this kind of Mexican at home! PS Cheap too!
0;"You want to know why locals always make fun of these idiot casino executives? Take a look at this place, it was a kitschy rotating bar famous for almost 5 decades and a fun spot for people to live out Fear and Loathing in LV moments or just experience one of the few things in this town that was authentic to \""the old days\"". Another plus for the casino is it was a draw for the non \""bargin hunters\"" and general jackassery normally found in the Circus Circus. Instead the bone they promoted to some post wanted to make his mark by callously tearing the bar out for an uberlame snack/ice cream thing. Now if you want to say its about the bottom line and the current incarnation makes more, fine but id say your wrong but fine. There's still plenty of real estate to put a crappy snack thing and still keep a bar. Anyhow Im super annoyed so I'll stop now."
1;This place is all about quantity, not quality.  If you're starving, come here.  If you want good food, go elsewhere.\n\nI had biscuits and gravy.  I used to live in the South, so I know what this dish (which, honestly, is just a heart attack on a plate) is all about.  The restaurant got the heart attack part right, but totally missed out on the part that makes the heart attack worth it.  The sausage gravy was chalky and flavorless.  The biscuits were cold.  Perplexingly, the biscuits and gravy were served on a massive bed of mashed potatoes.  Now, I love mashed potatoes, but it just didn't fit in here.  I ate less than a quarter of it.  No one else at my table finished their meals either, and we all agreed that it was pretty mediocre.  \n\nService was much better than I ever would've guessed, which is the only reason that they get two stars.
1;"PC is one of those low brow chain stores that everyone thumbs their noses at until they desperately need something from there. That's right, Party City, you're the Wal-Mart of party supply stores. \n\nAnd what's with the clever misnomer? I've been inside PC many an unfortunate occasion, and have yet to see a party. Only disheveled parents shuffling around trash-strewn aisles searching for Dora the Explorder party favors. I never understood party favors. I mean, I can see giving your guests some leftover finger food or some unopened bottles of soda/liquor on their way out, but no one ever says \""HOT DAMN THAT WAS AN AWESOME PARTY! AND LOOK, I GOT A FUCKING NINJA TURTLES NOISEMAKER! THIS WAS THE BEST PARTY EVER!\""\n\nWhen I host a party, I admittedly make goodie bags for the guests, but they're usually full of things they're going to use during or after the party (lotion, candy, condoms, I'm not going to elaborate any further). You're not going to find any of that useful shit at Party City. \n\nAnd anybody who admits to have bought their costume at Party City isn't going to be at any parties where there will be pictures taken. Because there is nothing worse than browsing through pictures of a party and hearing people chuckle \""where the fuck did he/she get that costume?\"". Do yourself a favor and buy a real costume, or make one yourself. \n\nAnd for the record, anything from Legs Avenue does not count as a costume. Legs Avenue costumes are constructed around one simple premise; that one can have sex in it without having to do any major adjusting. That's not a costume you're wearing, it's very elaborate underwear. Go to Spirit or Easley's, get a real costume, and God help you if you come back as a schoolgirl or as The Crow. \n\nThe most intriguing aspect of PC is their hiring policy. While Guitar Center may actually attempt to hire people who know stuff about guitars, Party City goes out of their way to hire people with no party-attending experience. \n\nGot a question? So do they; why are you asking? They don't know. They're just here until Zia Records starts hiring again.\n\nThe one thing Party City does well is uphold corporate standards. Every store is at the same level of filthiness, and every staff member is guaranteed to be the idiot you were hoping they wouldn't be. It's exactly the kind of insipid conformity you'd expect from a chain.\n\nJust give me a few more minutes and I'll get off the high horse.\n\nI'm hostessing a Halloween party this month, and you can bet you won't find me looking for skeleton napkins and vampire plates here. Unless I forget to buy them earlier and end up running here because it's right by my house and really convenient, but I will totally lie about where I got them if you ask me later. Don't ask to see the receipt. It's in the trash with my Wal-Mart receipt and Whopper wrapper."
2;"I really liked how they had various gourmet plates in a buffet setting, you know, things that you won't normally order at a fancy restaurant, i.e. watermelon with Sriracha and lime drizzle. The selection for salad and meat were substantial and they had a mountain of king crab legs for the customers. Prime rib was good, sushi was \""meh\""... my favorites included the sausage, roasted pork belly, and OMG the huge dessert bar. \n\nOverall, I wasn't impressed by the buffet and they didn't have much of a seafood selection. Food quality was definitely better than typical local buffet, but just \""OK\"" for Vegas."
4;An absolutely delicious brunch with honest food and eager to please staff. Youll definitely see me again.
1;"I love Mexican and a super long time ago (circa 2000) I remember Zapatas (University) being really good. No mas. No bueno. \n\nThe salsas to start were watery and the mild tasted solely of black pepper. That was just weird. The chips were plentiful but very bland. They needed salt in a bad way and I rarely need to add salt to anything. \n\nWe were barely seated less then a minute when the waitress asked if we were ready to order.  Seriously. I had just opened my menu. Also, no specials on Saturday? That was weird. \n\nI ordered the chimichanga and asked for queso on the side because I like my chimichanga crunchy. When it came out, there was some other red sauce on it. Dang. Defeated the purpose of a crispy shell but at that point I was ready to eat anything besides the chips and bad salsa. \n\nI really wanted this place to be awesome so it could go in the rotation of \""Places we can walk to for Lunch\"".  It deserves 1 1/2 stars but I'll be generous and give them a 2. Save your money and put it towards gas to drive to a decent Mexican place."
4;Can't get enough of this place. My favorite is the the farmhouse with spaghetti, roasted garlic and mushrooms. It's super creamy with the just the right amount of saltiness coming the the pancetta. Plus, I don't feel so bad about eating cream sauce cause I ate my vegetables in the form of peas!
3;the food was good, but the wait is not. and i noticed the reason it took so long was because service really is very slow. there was only on waitress behind the bar for everyone, and the time to get our food, receive the check, and run the check took FOREVER.
3;Kabuki, I was pleasantly surprised!  \n\nWe ordered quite a bit on the menu, and I can't say I was disappointed with anything!\n\nGarlic Edamame ($4.95): Sauteed with Sea Salt and Garlic. This was very garlicky and delicious! Loved the bits of crunchy garlic...one of the better versions I've had actually :P\n\nYakibuta ($6.95): Pork, Jalapeno, and Green Onions. Wish it was a little more tender, but the flavor was good.  Looks like pork belly, but it isn't as fatty or tender as belly.\n\nOmakase Deluxe ($13.95): Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Shrimp, Albacore & Spicy Tuna Roll. SURPRISINGLY GOOD quality nigiri here! I didn't think this would fill me up, but with the appetizers and sides, I left stuffed.  \n\nI would come here again if I am hungry in Town Square :)
4;Two thumbs up for the Dutches Auto! No b.s. great service and kind folks.
1;I am so disappointed in the valets customer service. I had no one directing me for my car so when I pulled up I pulled up in a spot so I wouldn't block a walkway. I got out of my car and pulled out everything myself and set it on the side of my car. And stood waiting for someone for a few min. Finally a guy starts waving at me to pull my car forward. I said I'm not going to put all my stuff back in my car to drive up 10 feet. He proceeded to roll his eyes at me and came over and told me that I needed to pull my car up. He made me have to leave my stuff sitting on the sidewalk so I could pull the car up myself. They were all rude to me and had terrible customer service. I work at the Wynn and this kind of thing would never ever happen there EVER!
3;"I am pleasantly surprised at this little mall.  Not only did they make it look pretty but they seem to cram a lot into this little space.  Each restaurant here is great and the shops are \""unique\"" as opposed to the mall standards.  Charming Charlies is great and the dog store looks interesting for dog owners.  They organize a weekly farmers market and several special events.  Bottles and Burgers is one of our favorites and I have heard great things about Brio, Kabuki and Petra.  Convenient to the freeway, two casinos and Summerlin, you will find Tivoli an interesting experience."
2;"Hob Nob's Coffee House and Gourmet Deli is what has emerged from the dust and smoke that once was the Willo House (one \""w\"", not two). Willo House was a Phoenix landmark beloved by many for its tremendous coffee, well-worn couches, and memories of Mary McCann's Poetry Slams--and loathed by others for its unmistakable smoke stench and vocally hung-over clientele.  So, like many CenPhos, I felt saddened  when I saw the \""closed\"" sign hung on Willo's door earlier this year, and I've been watching for this coffee interloper to open its doors. I've been hopeful that we'd find a new funky midtown establishment to add to Phoenix's growing reputation for goodness. \n\nFeeling emboldened and optimistic after voting on November 4th, Baby Oli and I stopped into Hob Nob's for a morning caffeine treat.  \nLet me begin by saying, holy moley, they got the smell of smoke out! I thought for sure that the odor of cloves and American Spirit would have permanently saturated the building's core.  In fact, there was not much at all inside to remind me of the Willo-that-was. They've knocked down walls to widen the space inside and painted in warm hues . The place now has what you might call \""a d\u00e9cor.\"" They said good-bye to funky and eclectic, and hello...hmm... Pottery Barn? \n\nI ordered an iced chai tea and a chocolate pastry. The chai was a chai, and the pastry was yummy, but not OMG-eat-here-this-instant yummy. The sandwich and salad menu looks awesome with sandwiches boasting of roast sirloin and \""the finest long line caught Albacore tuna center cut all white meat.\""  They also have some pretty impressive looking hand-made chocolates.\n\nI'm not going to lie, I do miss the old, lovingly run-down, Willo style. Hob Nob's felt a little too Scottsdale to me. I may be 100% wrong on this, but I don't think the owners of Hob Nob's are Phoenicians. The man who made my Chai had clearly never been to--or maybe even heard of--the original Willo, and wasn't interested in any jovial chit chat about the old locale, they spelled \""Willo House\"" incorrectly on their take-away menu, and the place simply doesn't have that Phoenix feel. \n\nRegardless of the Scottsdale vibe, I will go back to try those sandwiches, or maybe to test out their springy couches and fire place while grading essays. I'd love to toss them one more star! Fingers crossed that they'll relax a bit and make the most of their great location!"
3;"Je tenais vraiment \u00e0 oublier ma premi\u00e8re exp\u00e9rience de service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le de la semaine pass\u00e9e, donc j'y suis retourn\u00e9e hier...

1;Had high hopes for this place but sadly was very disappointed. The calamari was super dry and flavorless. The garlic knots are OK, but again dry and very little flavor. I actually do prefer mine with somewhat of a light butter on them (not soaking in butter or oil, just a little). Penne Elizabeth didn't have much flavor and I can't even remember the name of the 2nd dish we ordered which tells you how great it was. I did like the ceasar dressing. Would like to give this place another try just because of all the great reviews. Food did take awhile to receive and the place was packed on a Sunday evening so heads up during football season.
2;Most of the dishes are great,!! But I agree w/ Henri T, Radio Milano is a bit overrated (service and food) and frankly, a bit over priced. \nThe atmosphere is very cool and fun for groups. \n\nBon Appetite!
3;The Palazzo is a great place to stay if you have a large group.  6 people can fit in their rooms very comfortably.  Rooms were clean and spacious.  Location is pretty good, next to the Wynn/Encore which has my favorite club and pool.   I would definitely stay here again in the future.  Vegas!!!!!
2;"My wife and I visited here last week and found it to be a good low-key restaurant.  Good clam chowder & fish and chips.  I had a whale ale that was swell.  My wife had the Whale Tai and also liked it.  If you're looking for a good restaurant that is a sorta \""average guy\"" kinda place, the Sign of The Whale might be the place for you."
2;Good customer service but the food was a bit dry. I think there is a new ownership because it is not as busy as it use to be and there are a lot of new employees. Overall an okay place to get a quick lunch or something.
3;Very nice place. The service and food were top notch. The spinach ravioli, recommended by our server, absolutely to die for.
3;A friend and I went to Twin Peaks to watch a basketball playoff game. Good enough selection of TV's and the happy hr drinks were awesome. $2.75 for a well drink is a pretty good deal, especially when served by one of the many very pretty servers who seem like they actually enjoy their job. Whether they do or not, I'm not sure, but if they don't, at least it didn't show. Chips and queso were really good, and quesadilla was too. So far, this chain has not disappointed and we will likely be back.
3;They have plenty of options, crab legs, sushi, Indian, greek, Italian, etc. all the food we ate we're delicious... I think they had the biggest selection then any other buffet I've been too... There was just something about it that didn't make me feel like 5 stars.
0;Took my wife for dinner on a Saturday night and ended up walking out after the first bite. The sushi was stale and room temp at best, with the selection limited to tuna and unagi. The food was terrible. I tried the s&s chicken and my wife tried some chicken with mushroom. Immediately after the first bites we looked at eachother and knew we were leaving. I feel bad only leaving a few bucks for the waitress but this place is revolting. How it got 4 stars is beyond me. I've had better chinese made by a french foreign national than this place.
2;Nice lounge in the casino area of Aria.  Limited menu, premium drinks, and blackjack tables with beautiful young dealers.  My friend sat down and won about $2K in an hour, obviously the exception, since the house always wins.  Overpriced but it's Vegas so expect it.  The waitress had a stick up her ass, grumpy at best, but the environment itself was nice.  Have a drink or two and leave.
2;"\""When you realize you've made a mistake, make amends immediately.  It's easier to eat crow while it's still warm.\""  -Dan Heist\n\nMy friends and I made reservations for dinner at MM before catching the 10pm Cirque du Soleil show at the Bellagio. Without delving into the details, let's just say the timing went awry and our dinner and show experience did not go as planned. \n\nAmends were made and handled with professionalism. Thank you Michael Mina for living up to your top tier reputation."
1;I usually go to this Starbucks since it's in my neighborhood and it's overall mediocre. the employees are usually nice but recently I've felt bitterness from most of the employees. must be a new staff or something. I went this morning to get a pumpkin spice latte and noticed it felt kind of light and opened my lid to see this. lovely!!
0;Do not ever rent a car here. They did not offer us roadside assistance to purchase.  We got a flat tire after driving 20 min. They refused to get help for us and even if we paid they said it would take 2-4 hours for any assistance to arrive. We were in the middle of no where in 100 degree heat.  Ive never had worse customer service ever.  Stick to other larger companies and make sure even when they don't offer to buy roadside assistance.
2;My wife and I meet there for dinner after work occasionally and generally feel the food is pretty good for the price and usually have decent waitress. The last time I was there the waitress kept disappearing and we had to ask another one for another drink and she never came back to see how we were doing. By the time we were ready to go we were pretty disgusted and I asked another waitress to take our check, cut the tip to 10% and told her to keep it instead of our waitress. While going up Greentree road I looked up at the restaurant and saw our waitress outside smoking. I blame the manager for this. Whoever the manager is should not let this go on.
3;"4.5 stars.  The extra .5 is just for our waitress, Shirley, who is awesome with her contagious laugh! (If they served freshly squeezed OJ, then this would be 5 star status). \n\nI am so excited that we finally found a local breakfast/ brunch location that we can be proud to call our breakfast home.  We must have come at the right time for Sunday brunch because we were seated with no problem.  But, after a few minutes- the waiting area was filled to the brim with hungry patrons.  \n\nI ordered the Eggs Florentine and after a number of misses with the hollandaise sauce at other breakfast joints- I finally found one that was perfect.  Of course, I mentioned yelp- and even got a free pot of freshly baked bread- and I selected the flavor of the day: apricot.  Yummo! My husband ordered his usual- chicken fried steak with a side of country potatoes and devoured it.  My cousin ordered an omelet and another ordered a sandwich with steak fries which were so delicious.  We also shared a plate of peach french toast and not a crumb was left.  Yes- we were quite the hungry bunch. \n\nAwesome service, awesome food and I love the fact that it is family owned.  We even left with some \""Jamms coffee mugs\"" because we are such fans.  As their motto says, we did \""enter as strangers, left as friends\"".  See you soon, new friend!"
4;Ate here with my dad and husband, my fellow sushi lovers. Their menu is very vast, and I definitely want to return to try their entrees. The Restaraunt is located in Caste Village, which is a shopping plaza, so it's not as spacious, but beautiful nonetheless. The ambiance is veer fancy yet low key. We all ordered tuna sashimi salads, which were essentially your typical salad with ginger dressing with  sliced avocado and tuna sashimi. The ginger dressing was a tad spicy for me but very good.  Upon ordering sushi I tried to mix it up as always, and ended up getting a roll that was wrapped in cucumber, which gave my sushi a nice crunch and cool texture. One of my favorite things in sushi is the marriage of the fish with things like cucumber or avocado, so I liked this roll very much. Nice presentation of sushi as well.  Very deliscious sushi, will definitely come back.
0;"This place used to be customer friendly and the food pretty tasty.  Well, I don't know about the food anymore because the last few times I came in, I waited, and waited, and waited for someone, anyone to take an order.   The people who work here should all be drawing unemployment; GENERALIZING????  Yes, I am because it happens every damn time I walk in the place, they are either mopping, talking, or no one is around except for the cashier.  I don't have 10 minutes to waste standing around watching a menu and not getting any service.  The food is overpriced anyway, if it wasn't for UNLV and the poor starving students who have got to eat, this place would be closed.  And finally, it is filthy....no more wasting my time with Einstein's here."
4;It's my nearest Starbucks which is lucky because it's also the friendliest in the valley - no really!
4;Willy is awesome, I just got my wife's iPhone fixed here, it only took 30 minutes. You can tell he is an honest guy, when I told him I wanted my iPad fixed also he said he had to wait for the part and to come in Monday, then mentioned if I took it anywhere else to make sure they don't break the wifi cable. That was nice of him although I will bring the ipad here for sure!
3;The Charlotte Museum of History is an important part of the Charlotte community. It is dedicated to preservation of the Revolutionary War era of Mecklenburg County. The jewel of the museum is the Rock House - oldest house in the county.  I have visited many times and really feel the staff does a great job. Go visit!
2;A little on the pricey side, but it is a gourmet sandwich place and you get a good amount of food. For $15, you get a sandwich of your choice, a bag of chips, your choice of an apple or banana, and a drink including some bottled selections.\n\nI ordered the goat cheese sandwich based on the reviews here. The flavors were interesting, but it lacked seasoning/salt. I was concerned that the sandwich would lack texture and be a mushy mess. The walnuts didn't offer much in that department and were barely detectible. The celery slices on the other hand, gave the sandwich a fresh cool crunch. I had a side of BBQ bagged kettle chips. House made kettle chips would be a nice touch here and give this place that real gourmet feel.
0;"I was going to tell a long story, but the basic fact is that the check-out clerk's parting remark to me was \""You're disgusting.\""  We had disagreed, but not argued.  Even if I had been disgusting, no retail clerk should every utter those words to a customer!  I will never set foot in Ulta again (at least not after I return the product I cannot now stand to use)."
3;Checked this place at night a few years ago... an original & authentic scene for live jazz.  A classy low light ambiance to this as well. This is a local's spot, so don't be touristy.
0;"First and foremost this is my first review and I cant believe how absolutely appalled I am.  But, here it goes.....So my wife and I are in town for a family emergency and decided to have lunch because we had a lil time on our hands. We drove past HAG on LV blvd and it caught my eye because of the name and I love a great burger. Upon entering I was excited and looking forward to it the place seems almost like a Hooters but for Burgers. The smock thing they have you wear when you come in is cool and gimmicky for the place but it didnt sit well with me to wear items that others have wore before but I figured hey WTH the waitress we had was very personable and  nice but was new. the prices were very high for such a simple menu. My wife ordered the smallest burger and fries and I was talked into the Quad bypass burger. with like 20 strips of bacon! I asked our waitress if the restaurant offered military discount as I often do when I am on a budget and travelling. She said \""Let me ask\"" upon returning she said \""No sorry\"" I was thanked her for asking. Either way I though it was a good time to have lunch with the wife and a new place so I was looking forward to the food regardless. At this point I was very excited and amused on the place and was talking to my wife about how this place should/would be a goldmine. They offered malt liquor (Strange in a restaurant)in a can I ordered a Tecate she a sugar Coke.\nNow for the twist of events..... Our food arrived in less than 10 minutes which is great but I was skeptical, The Burger was massive and looked so good but it was warm to the touch at best I had approx 3 bites and noticed the bacon looked as if had been microwaved from being cooked days ago and was the same a spaghetti in consistency-(Gross) The cheese was not melted, The fries looked like they were cooked in old oil due to the almost black color in nature. I tried my hardest to stomach this but I couldnt. I proceeded to flag down my waitress and ask her if this was old vice cooked to order at first she replied yes and then said something that made me raise an eyebrow, she began on informing me and my wife that she wouldnt doubt if the food was old because of the way the owner is. I asked her to elaborate and she said he is so cheap that he makes his staff count each napkin and plastic cup everyday in order to cut costs. She also informed me she almost walked out her second day on the job because of what he acts like in his day to day operations. She looked excited when I asked to speak to him about the quality and preparation of my food. When the Owner/manager Jon came to the table he sat down opposite from me and was very hostile. At this point I was pretty much amazed I would assume he would address my concerns in a professional and couteous manner vice an attempt at intimidation and apprehension. I said I would please like another burger due to the dissatisfaction of it not being fresh. He looks at myself and my wife and says' \"" In six years I have never comped a meal and it won't be today!!\"" I proceeded to inform him I simply wanted another burger and I am not looking for a comp. He then informed us that he would call the police if we didnt pay I said I would not pay for a burger like this especially one that i didnt touch. From his demeanor at this point I wanted to leave so i said look I will pay for my wifes and her drink and the beer i did not even drink but i will not pay for this quality of food.\nAt this point I felt threatened and was basically being held against my own will. I said fine Please call the police. He proceeds to lean over and say, You know what \"" you started it when you asked for a discount\"" I was like \""What\""? He then says I cant stand the \""F\"" ing military I was so appalled that he was addressing me like this in general and then he begins to say, I'm from Oxnard, Ca. and we used to beat the \""S\"" out of filthy mexicans like you! At this point myself and my wife are in utter disbelief He leaves and the table next to me were also expressing there disgust in the food and as he saw us speaking with them he said to leave right now we were trespassing! As I leave I attempt to tip my waitress and he rips the money from my hand! My wife and I wait outside for the police THE WHOLE TIME WE are waiting quietly the owner is harrassing us going on a tirade about my race and my occupation being totally distasteful in front of my wife around 15 min later the show up (LVPD) I provide them ID and they are in absolute disbelief they resolve the issue after questioning and bottom line it does not matter the police officer said I had to pay I totally understand and uphold the law but requested that I receive what I pay for (At least I gave it away to a homeless man.\nBOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: 1. DO NOT GO THERE FOR QUALITY OR FRESHNESS  IT LOOKS GOOD BUT IS NOT 2. THE OWNER IS A DISGUSTING HUMAN BEING. 3.YOU ARE WARNED. PLEASE DONT BE ROBBED OR DEGRADED LIKE ME  GO ANYWHERE ELSE."
2;Coupons were very misleading.  Received a buy one entree, get one 1/2 half.  This coupon did not apply to hamburgers?! Food was good but very overpriced.  Burgers and fries were very big and good.  Recommend splitting with another person.
4;Sunbum here with Jill eating the sea urchin. (First time for Jill) \nI say this place is the best sushi place in Scottsdale Area!! Very fresh and well cut !! and great appetizers !! Go there right now and try for yourself ! Bring few people! You need to share the experience!!
2;"Based on the friend who took me to lunch here, as well as the full parking lot, I was expecting this place to be the best thing on earth.  Overall I can't complain.  The food was good.  They give you real plates and silverware, but yet it still feels casual and fun.  The prices were fair.  However, I was not blown away.  I got the 1/2 chicken with sweet potato fries,  The chicken had good flavor, but was a little tough and I could see this being replicated at most any casual dining place.  The fries were average and lacked that \""something\"" that makes sweet potato fries different than regular fries.  The best thing on the plate was the cornbread - a real star here.  \n\nOne thing I really liked was the high backed booths, which made you feel like you were the only people in the restaurant, even when full.  Even with this, though, the acoustics were of such where it was hard to have a conversation, and the music was a bit loud.  \n\nI really want to come back and try some of their more \""tex mex\"" type dishes.  My friend works near this place, so I feel this is a reason why he\nhas grown to appreciate it more.  It is good, but not worth going out of the way for."
2;I was once banned from going here by a friend, because I was told the food is bad. I don't actually think that, but every time I have gone here I have ordered the same dish - the sweet & spice pepper chicken with rice thing (that isn't really what it is called).\n\nOne nice thing about this place is the outdoor seating which is pretty hard to come by in Squirrel Hill.
3;They have a slew of martini specials.  I tried the bubble gum and strawberry lemonade martini.  Both were very delicious.  The food is great.   I tried the Cajun chicken sandwich, steak salad, and my favorite the Charles special.  The Charles special is named after the owner.  It's a mixed green salad serviced with candied pecans, berries, and raspberry vinaigrette.  Aside from the delicious food, they have drink specials.  My favorite night is Saturday.  On Saturday's they have a party hosted by Money B of Digital Underground.  The DJ plays old school Hip Hop music and current hits.  I will definitely be back.
1;What the hell? 4 stars? NO WAY. Yelpers have let me down big time. The name would imply a fun place to eat with a large group. Interesting modern decor, nice setting. Other than that though - this was a HUGE disappointment for my bf's birthday dinner. None of the 13 of us were into the food. Overpriced. Bad non-attentive service. Bad sushi. What a joke!!\n\nWe pretty much ordered the whole menu amongst so many of us. And I don't think anything was good! The Filipino dishes were terrible. Chicken Adobo Sliders were dryyyyyyyyyyy, cheap crappy buns and a waste of calories. The Pancit was tasteless and a complete rip off for a small small plate. Lumpia also not worth writing about...\n\nWhat is this hype I'm reading about? The whole group was wondering how I picked such a bad restaurant. They've come to trust me and my Yelp friends. I was embarassed. Major disappointment.
2;I've been here a couple times. Decor is nice and open. Clean and relaxed atmosphere. While I feel the food here is decent,  I personally feel it is a bit overpriced for what it is. Service for the most part was good. It ain't up there with buffets such as Bacchanal or Bellagio but it's ok.
1;Food is adequate to satisfy the appetite.  Served cafeteria-style.  I had the pancit and lechon.  My mother makes way better pancit, and the lechon was either dry or had to much fat on it.  Food is mediocre at best.
1;Pass. Bad food and even worse service. Took 15 min to get water, 15 minutes to pay, waitress dropped a glass of water on the table and in my lap.\n\nBad eggs, bad cheese, bad potatoes, bad sausage (the enormous Italian sausage sized bad sausage). They have a frozen hot chocolate that they are famous for which is why they get 2 stars.\n\nOh and the bathroom is around the corner from the restaurant on the ground level of an employee parking garage, pretty bizarre. I heard that they get lines at night and make the last person in line wear a sign that says he's the last one served in exchange for a free frozen hot chocolate.
3;I have a 2012 ZDX. The car has run excellent and I love all the features. A few days ago, the car computer reported that it was time for an oil change. I called the service center and they made it very easy to set up my appointment. I was kept well informed throughout the process of my service. I would have given them 5-stars, but I had to fight to get the oil change for free. When I bought the car I had it negotiated to get 3-years of free oil changes. I felt that they should have documented in my file about the oil change instead of putting it on me to prove that they has made me that promise.
0;I have tried this place a couple of times because it is conveniently located but I wont be going back.  The first time I went there were 4 people in line ahead of me and it took 15 minutes to get my coffee.  The second time I went I ordered a vanilla latte but they forgot to add the flavor shot.  The coffee was not good enough to make up for the bad service.
0;The 1 star is based on the service.  \nThis is the 2nd time in 3 weeks that I have tried to call in an order and have been put on hold for over 5 minutes. I don't know if they forgot I'm on hold or what. I called back and got put right back on hold.\nToo bad I really liked there pizza & salads.  So long Napoli....
1;so0o0 how i made it back to the Aria this trip i dont know (wasnt impressed the last few times ive visited) and how in the HELL i made it to the gold lounge was this... buy one get one drink free pass... fukkin SWEETT right?? WRONG!!! place was over packed, drinks was watered down and when i ordered 2 jager bombs as i waved my coupon to the rather RUDE ASS BARTENDER, i was chargered 17 bucks! which means he charged me for 2 JB and then took my gotdamn coupon!! WTF!! the staff was so0o0o rude and mean, and even at 430am had the nerve to be picky about letting me and my boyfriend re enter! haaA, whata joke! gave em 2stars for the music... very much on point!!!
2;"Sometimes the smartest thing you can do for your stomach is give it a rest from all that buffet action In Las Vegas. That's where Sam Woo BBQ Restaurant comes into play.........\n\nLooking for something light???? May I suggest the shrimp/pork won ton mein over here. \nUmmmmm, a very light broth, with a few won ton dumplings, Chinese choi sum, & a very thin noodle. Just the right thing to keep you going, especially since I've been up for almost two days straight (man, am I tired!).\n\nLooks like this small restaurant has a little take out \""to go\"" section, and they even make their own roast pork, and roast duck.\n\nI can see that Sam Woo's has won many awards in the past. The last was a Zaget award back in year 2012.\n\nLots of parking in the strip mall, service was fast.........but when you go during off hours, it shouldn't be a problem correct?"
1;When you come to a place thats this highly rated, you come in with certain expectations.  Don't.  Fish tacos here are a bit overrated and ceviche was just average.   The vibe was excellent but food was par at best.
1;Mediocre food and service. I probably would have given three or four stars, but the coed restroom (complete with pushy attendant) kills the experience for me.
4;"Your typical snob from Summerlin would Hate this place!  I - on the other hand say, \""me gusto mucho!\"" If my Spanish is off - I am trying to say I like it.  \n\nWe just happened to be in the area and yelped mexican food.  The pictures on Yelp looked good so we thought we would try it.  It was about 8:00 pm on a Sunday.\n\nTrue story - when I moved to Las Vegas 20 years ago I went to UNLV, so I lived in the area.  I used to go to the Tower records in this strip mall!  Now I am back 20 years later... Anyways I thought that was interesting.\n\nThis place is kinda dumpy inside, it was dark and a bit cluttered.  No big deal though - I was sorta expecting that.  The service was muy bueno.  Super friendly waitresses.\n\nThe food is Honduran.  They had some Mexican dishes, too.  I ordered the Honduran special dinner plate.  It was compartmentalized like a cobb salad, but of course with out the cobb salad stuff.  It had a piece of steak, 2 eggs, sour cream, cheese, plantanos, rice, avocado and beans.  It was a strange combo but I did enjoy it.  A friend ordered the flautas and said they were very delicious.  Another friend had the pupusas and said they were tasty!  \n\nThe food is moderately priced.  Great value here.\n\nAround 9:00 they busted out some Karaoke!  Seriously.  It was all in Spanish, but it was cool.  It got crowded, too.  People there were having a good time.  They were serving beer, not sure about alcohol though.\n\nOne observation was there were almost all men here.  So, for you ladies looking to score a latin lover your chances here are through the roof at this place!!\n\nThe name \""Rincon Catracho\"" translated is --- \""Honduran Corner .\"""
1;I went on Diwali with my family and we all faced stomach problem after eating their vada which was not good in taste either. Other wise southindian dishes were not good and north indian dishes where ok.
0;I went to this place and I have to say I am not happy.  Although the two men washing my car were very nice and welcoming, they didn't clean my car good.  I got the 40 dollar deal for 22 dollars.  The inside of my car was clean but the outside was horriblex. When I got home I noticed that the car had these black stains all over.  They were like small spots.   It was dirt, so they didn't clean the car well.  I had to go home and take some time to scrub and clean the car.  It also had like glue on it and i just bought this car three days ago!  Very disappointed, I want my car to look nice but never again will I go here.
2;Overall pretty good experience. We came in with a party of 20 and they were very quick to get us settled. Sushi was ok. I think they tried to do too much with it. Multiple sauces and extravagant garnish took away from the fish. Get location and atmosphere. With our large group the server was organized and efficient with orders, running food, LOTS of booze, and splitting checks.
3;OK, The M is one of my favorite casinos, because it it beautiful but has a small town feel.   I've eaten at their buffet and it is one of the best ones in a city filled with buffets.  \n\nWe saw Hash House on a FOOD Network special and decided we had to try it, because the food looked so good.  The food was good, but the flavors were less intense than I had originally hoped.  The portions were HUGE though and one plate can easily feed two people, so keep that in mind.
2;I wasn't sure if I was at Charlotte Motor Speedway or not.  Holy freakin traffic nightmares.  The show ended at 11:00, didn't get home until 2:30...and I live 40 minutes away.\n\nAs far as venues go, the setup at Verizon is actually pretty nice.  Major kudos to the sound technicians too.  Way above average!  The downside to the venue is the cramped seating and concession prices.\n\nIf you're hungry or thirsty for some cold ones, get it done in the parking lot.  Git er Done!!  Sorry, couldn't help myself.\n\nOverall, the experience is great until you have to leave.  The traffic leaving can turn a great night into one that made you wish you stayed home.
2;"I am from Long Beach, CA, and this was a staple of my diet. When I moved to AZ, I thought L&L was relegated to the attic of my mind. Then I found this spot while incorrectly looking for a lunch spot using 800-GOOG-411 and almost sh*t a brick. I was glad to find that it was almost exactly what I remembered from CA. A few notes; the biz didn't look all that promising, so I'll enjoy it while I can, and I don't recommend any menu items with SPAM in it..."
0;Nothing to Write about.  \nI Love sweety & i Love cupcakes but These. I tried 3 were just Not Good. \nTo pricey & Not Good is a Bad combination.
3;Our flight was delayed flying out of the Las Vegas airport so we were stuck at the airport for almost three hours. I got quite hungry and made my rounds to all the food places to eat but nothing seemed appetizing...when I came to this PACKED place, this is where I wanted to eat-plus it was right next to our terminal C14..I ordered the nachos with carnitas and let me tell you, for a minute , I forgot I was at the airport...MYFOOD WAS SO YUMMY - Great service too , thanks Angelina !!! Great way to end our vacation :-)
2;I have never heard of korean barbeque without lettuce!!!! They gave us some kind of salad that was bland. I just didn't enjoy the meat cause they were tasteless that i literally had to dip everything in the sesame oil to get some taste in it. Coming from a korean background i have tasted better and expected more from a Korean restaurant.
0;First Impression... :(  Just moved to this neighborhood... and I come here last night at 5:00 pm and it's CLOSED!  No sign as to why and there was even a guy standing there inside who put up his hands like he didn't know what I wanted.  REALLY?  The sign says Open until 9pm it was 5pm!  So I went down the way to another place to feed my family... WHY were you closed?!?!?! Not again!
2;Had high hopes for this place, but was disappointed.  Forget the fact that the waiter screwed up my wife's burger by writing down the wrong order, it just wasn't that good.  They skimp on the toppings and we ordered our burgers medium (they ask you how you want it cooked) and they arrived well done.  Simply not very juicy.\n\nShake was fine, but arrived in a silver malt cup?....no glass?  You've got to be kidding.  They don't put any fresh mix ins into your shake, they are simply flavored from various bottles.  For example, I ordered chocolate Heath Bar almond and received an almond flavored chocolate shake, but had no almonds or Heath Bars in it!  WTF?\n\nSave your time and money and go to In-N-Out.  You know they never get it wrong there.
2;Not really impressed. Its essentially the same as the 1970s-esque Memphis airport. Its designed goofy, smells like old shoes, but redeems itself with some unique decor.
3;If you're visiting Phoenix or even if you have a long layover, Beckett's Table is definitely worth a visit, especially if you have a gluten allergy. It doesn't look like much from the outside as it's just at the edge of a non-descript strip mall. Once you walk in you notice a really cool interior with awesome big beams, brickwork and a nice looking bar. \n\nThe menu isn't huge, but there are enough options where you'll find something interesting and gluten free items are clearly marked. Iced tea is tasty, but served with an orange instead of a lemon, weird. The short ribs were packed with flavor and if you order with the stuffing instead of mashed potatoes you get even more flavor. Serving size is like the menu, not huge, but enough to make sure you're satisfied. Gluten free shrimp and sausage comes with a separate sauce and you can hold the sausage if that's not your thing. \n\nThe donut holes for dessert were too good to pass up, but for $9 you better have someone without a gluten allergy to share them with. Those dense fried little nuggets pack a punch. The best part was the banana pudding underneath each one.
4;Soo good! Pancakes are huge and filling! So if you order three pancakes, you will not finish them... Trust me! Friendly staff. Must try at least once!
4;Awesome food.Great Service. This place you pay to play in this sandbox. Worth every penny!
4;This is a great thing to do with kids for sure. But it's just great to do in general. The diplay is beautiful and the education experience is priceless. It's a great activity if you're down at this end of the Strip but want to get out of the casinos. I suggest going in the middle of the week to avoid a line.
2;If you're looking for a fabulous patio, you have found the place.  Tiki has a full bar and a great indoor/outdoor atmosphere, this is a great happy hour or group kind of place.  \n\nI agree with most on here that the food was ok.  I had the tofu with a lemon sauce and it was good, but not nearly as flavorful as others I have had at other restaurants.  \n\nI could see this as being a place to meet for happy hour, informal meeting or just day drinking, but I wouldn't stay for dinner.  Neither my guest or I were blown away by the favors of the food, but the drink menu and atmosphere were wonderful.
1;Eh...nothing special here. If you are craving REAL mexican food with real cheese stay away  from Agave. I came here because of the yelp deal but it never looked that great to me driving through the shopping center. Im not a cook but I can easily whip up the menu and it would taste just the same. I guess i call this bar food or the ...?? No, Kraft Mac n Cheese of Mexican.
0;Roach spotted in ladies room closest to the Big Seafood Buffet. YUK!
4;"If getting a pitcher (of beer) opt for the \""Sconnie Beer\"" - same price as Bud/Miller/PBR but better and local"
3;For a 100 bucks a night you cant beat it(the prices will vary).
1;There seems to be a good variety of stores here.. but all the stores are on the smaller side and the items they have are not cute. What's the point of paying 70% off retail when the clothes are unwearable?\n\nPros: \n- Williams-Sonoma outlet\n- If you decide to drag your bf/husband/fiance shopping, he can go gamble next door while you spend his money.. well, attempt to spend his money.
4;Vegas Trophies was able to make me a custom trophy for my husband using an item I bought online when every other trophy store in Vegas said it was impossible. The staff is friendly and professional not to mention they were able to make this custom piece in ONE day! I'm extremely impressed and highly recommend this business!
2;Went here with some friends after an ASU Graduation Ceremony and it was dead. Service was alright and our chef was nice but wasn't very engaging. The chicken fried rice was the best I have ever had from a teppenyaki style restaurant. The steak on the other hand was not cooked to liking.
4;I've only been here on Sundays for brunch, but i'll speak on behalf of the buffet. It's impressive, affordable, and delicious. Even if you're a meat eater like myself, you'll enjoy it. Great staff, atmosphere. I wish i knew what kind of coffee they serve because, in my opinion, it's one of the best cups of coffee to get in the city.
4;Yes. Fish tacos @($1.50 ea) are very good!! This was my first time so not sure about the rest of the stuff. My bf had the carne asada tacos & await it was very good. Would def come back!
1;i hate going to this Walmart i only go because of the closeness to my house. Every employee is rude and unhelpful.The managers are rude and disrespectful to customers and staff. i witnessed them yelling at them. then i go up to the deli counter and met Matthew. He was the happiest and most helpful person in the entire store i asked him where to find products and he told me exactly where to find them and if i didn't to come back and he would go with me. I asked him why he wasn't a manager and he said he didn't know and a lot of employees have asked him that as well he knows everything about this store it seems. he is there all the time. and he even tells customers his schedule to make sure they are treated right when they are there
4;"Unreal. \n\nI won't waste too many words blubbering over how great this place was. What I will say is that I've eaten at a lot more expensive places with a lot more \""stars\"" and James Beard awards and I could not believe the level of food here. I would easily drive hours or even fly to eat here again."
1;Simple review:  the food and service are good if you don't mind smelling like an ashtray after.  I can't go for lunch because I can't stand smelling like that all day.  \n\nI can't believe this place gets by with allowing smoking considering how much food they seem to serve.
3;yay Gallagher's!  One of my favorite places as a local to go.  Consistently good and great atmosphere.
1;Pros - all you can eat peanuts, large portions\n\nCons - bad for people who are allergic to peanuts because the shells are everywhere, most expensive burger meal I've had in awhile at $12 (cheeseburger, cajun fries, and soft drink), slower than other burger joints, no drive through\n\nThe portion was big...I ended up throwing away most of my fries.  I prefer Fatburger over Five Guys.
1;Looks like a real old-school comedy club, very small, seating at tables, and a low stage with red velvet curtain. I didn't go when Brad Garrett was there, so we had a bunch of no name comedians who came up and preformed. Everyone who came up were really amateurs who jumped from joke to joke with no real momentum. They really overused curse words, which really watered down most of the jokes. Using the F-word really loud doesn't make for good comedy.\n\nI got two free tickets off MyVegas, so my 2 friends and I all split a third ticket for only $55. Went there on 2/13/13. My friends and I came a little late, so the host gave us a booth in the back, which was still pretty close as the place is pretty small. I just wanted a glass of water, but had to pay $6 for Fiji Water instead. I wouldn't really recommend going back to this comedy club unless your really drunk or just looking for a cheap show. It seemed like it was kind of a hit or miss place for comedians, but all of the people there my night were misses. If your going to go, get the two free tickets of MyVegas, drink a lot before you go, and don't have very high expectations. Can't really spend a whole night there, but it's something to do.
3;TERRIFIC CHILI FRIES!!! Not too soggy, they were generous with the chili as well. The dogs are well priced & the service is absolutely genuine. I can't leave without leaving atleast a few dollars in their tip jar. Needless to say, my boyfriend & I will become regulars at this establishment.
3;"This place seems to have its place in local & movie history and has lot of autographed photos of movie stars dating back to the 60's.  It's not too far from ASU and has been around for decades.  Harlows' rises above other morning establishments with fresh typical breakfast dishes as well as great signature meals. Plus, it's not a chain so it has that mom n pop feeling right away as you enter into the restaurant (nothing fancy, but a place that you can sense has down right good eats).\n\nThe fresh juice is squeezed daily and their homemade muffins come served to your table piping hot.  We tried a little of all three muffins (blueberry, peach, and strawberry) they had that morning but could only consume little chunks of each because we were so full from our meals.  I had the Eggs Maximillian with chorizo both times I've been here and it still tastes great.  The combination of eggs with chorizo, onions, green chilies, scallions, and salsa on top of bed of home fires is simply overwhelming (In a very good way).\n\nThe excitement from the first time had gone away, but the food was still delicious.  I really wanted to get a side of their fresh made biscuits and gravy, but saw the portions and knew that I had to select one dish or the other and not both.\n\nThe service is top notch and the food came out quick, hot and very fresh tasting.  The very nice waitresses are never rude, pushy or short tempered. And the prices are very reasonable for what you get; great service, great food at really decent prices.\n\nThe only bad thing and it's not really their fault is that the parking is extremely bad (so I heavily suggest carpooling)."
1;Went to Jade's Palace last night since we have not been there in a while. I mainly go for the New York Egg Rolls. The service was not great since it took 30 minutes to get our wonton soup and then they didn't bring our egg rolls out until another 15 minutes later.  I ask to ask our waiter where our food was and when it finally came out 15 minutes after the egg rolls, they forgot to put cashews on our cashew chicken.  Food was decent, but didn't make up for the wait.  Not to mention we were the youngest people in the place given that everyone else was on medicare.
3;I am so fantastically jealous of the meat eaters when I see the cottage pie. I wish they'd make a veggie version. \n\nSigh.\n\nThe food is authentically English, and the environment can make you forget where you are for the evening. I don't even mind that my only real dinner option is the cheese appetizer...it's a fun cheese plate with lots of relish. There's also the veggie salad that's pretty good.\n\nWhile I often leave hungry, I still like this pub. The bar is stocked with all kinds of goodies, and the patio is as good as any in the area.
4;I have been coming here over a year now.  Jason cut my hair once, and it was excellent.  Dusty is my usual barber though, and he does a great job.  After having my hair seriously messed up at other local places I have finally found a place I like.  I have waited over two hours for a cut before, but every customer gets full attention and they never rush.  The other barbers in there seem to do fantastic jobs too.  I just go to dusty because because he does a good job and he's just the guy I always go to!\n\nNo complaints, just a great cut and real barber shop experience.
1;Decent wine deals. Horrible food.\n\nI mean horrible.
0;Do yourself a favor and go to another kinkos location. This one is the absolute worst I've ever encountered across the country. Slow is an understatement. They are under staffed and they don't care at all. I waited 25 minutes for 5 pages of black and white text to print. FIVE PAGES. There was literally not one person in there when i walked in. In that moment, they were over staffed and still didnt care. At all. Consider yourself warned.
0;"Biggest POS airline in America.  Charged me $100 at gate for a carry-on that fit (rollers in first) in overhead compartment but was larger than their arbitrary \""max size carry-on.\""  Notably, they still allowed me to carry it on.  THEN we were delayed bc they let passengers on who were booked on a later flight.  They suck.  Not worth the discount."
2;I agree with the other reviewer that this Margiotta is not as good as the one nearby. It doesn't have the same character. It still remains a convenience store, but with another Margiotta nearby, and two Scotmids within proximity, one wonders just how convenient a shop needs to be. \n\nAs with other Margiottas, the standard of food sold is on the whole pretty high. The trade off is that its more expensive. This is find for odds and ends like milk and bread (you won't notice much), but any sort of bulk shop and you'll begin to feel your wallet getting a touch lighter.\n\nHowever I do have to point out how the friendly the staff are. It didn't used to be the way, but whoever they have in operating the tills now are a helpful and particularly smiley bunch.
4;On Saturday the 9th I went to Canyon Falls Spa & Salon for a facial, massage and hair trim.  This was my first time @ CFSS.\nThe lady at reception was friendly and helpful.\nThe manager was just was friendly and helpful.\nI had the best massage I've ever had from Janet Grady.  A wonderful facial from Kai and a nice experience with Shanna with my hair.  Shanna is now my new stylist!!!\nVery friendly, peaceful enviroment.  I will be back!
3;we rolled into town starving and the flamingo was right next door so we hit it up for the brunch menu. it's not fancy but the food was pretty good. \n\nprice is reasonable for stuffing yourself compared to other hotels, but like i said, it's not fancy. the salad bar...very good. some of the hot food...a little dried out looking. shrimp were a bit watery and soggy and crab legs req'd more work that was worth, but hey...we came in our elastic pants and left with no room to spare...so it couldn't have been that bad!
1;Ugh...I wish I could say I liked this place more since I was here to see Kaskade!! Unfortunately, this place just didn't do it for me. I appreciate their efforts of re-entry but I'm afraid to say that it makes the place WAY too crowded. A couple of other concerns tao...\n1. I didn't like the hip hop room and thought it was rather awkward \n2. Why are there tables in the hallway/walkway area? What's the point of that...you can't see anything! \n3. Every bathroom I used was gross and dirty (in my opinion) no toilet seat covers, etc. \n4. Way too many Asians \n5. Lastly, I was told by multiple employees that Kaskade would start his set at 1. That was a lie. (Boo) \n\nSorry Tao, I'd rather spend my night somewhere else
1;We are here the night we moved so didn't know the area or consult yelp first-- bummer. While it wasn't horrendous, it was pricey for what we got and there wasn't even beer or wine service. There's so much good pizza in Vegas now, shame to waste the money or calories...
3;This is one of the only sushi bars I go to! First off the service is normally great, aside from the female bartender that has way to many tables to stay ahead. (She is very nice but needs help in the bar area) The sushi is amazing! The sushi chefs are very talkitive and friendly and happy hour is to die for! Down side...aside from the restaurant needing a 'hip' makeover I cant think of any! Go here if you want some great sushi! Manager is very nice!
1;I would rather go to the Onion Barn. Every time I go in there I step on a potato! I love my new brown couch but the burlap material is too itchy and they won't let me return it. I wouldn't recommend this place
1;Very average BBQ.\n\nSides are not very good, at all:\nBeans are thick like cement with out-of-the-can flavor\nRussian Cabbage is WAY too sweet and mushy\nMashed Potatoes were pretty good, but not special\n\nMeats All WAY too dry.\nBrisket had good flavor so the moist parts were very good - but most was way too dry\nChicken had decent flavor\nTri-Tip might have been OK but it was tough and dry\n\nAnd it is pretty expensive.\n\nFor this kind of scratch Rudy's rules over this place.
0;To start off, they got the order wrong.  You know that feeling when you stop somewhere because you're craving something?  UGH!  Not only did they get the order wrong, but it was with two things that were so hot that my stomach was burning by the time I finished.  Good, but hot.  The guacamole was watered down, the salsa was watered down, and the refried beans were watered down!  Saving money maybe?  The rice wasn't done the same as usual Robertos either.  Too salty.  I was really disappointed.  Skip this Roberto's and go to a different one.  Not worth it.
2;I love the Vintage and come here a lot. I would recommend it to others, but it feels like more of a 3.5 star kind of place lately.  \n\nThe atmosphere is cool. The restaurant is very large and can accommodate groups well.  The bar area has plenty of TVs. They have a great happy hour. The service has always been timely and pleasant.\n\nSome of my favorite dishes are the pot roast balls and the stroganoff. My husband's favorites are the pastrami a-go-go and the burgers. The fries are really good. An amazing appetizer I can't get enough of is the chips with beer cheese dip. \n\nSo why 3.5 stars? INCONSISTENCY.  I've had many good experiences, but I've also had experiences where I've been disappointed with my favorite dishes. For example, I raved about the pot roast balls and my dad ordered them and got a plate that looked like 2 good pot roast balls and one weird misshapen half of a pot roast ball. On another occasion, I talked up the beer cheese dip, and my friends and I were disappointed when our dip was served at a luke warm temperature. On my most recent visit, I had the pumpkin ravioli which had a delicious filling and an amazing sauce, but the actual ravioli was very thick and dense and chewy.  \n\nI expect better from you Vintage! I'll keep coming back, but they need to work on serving a consistent product, so I can stop wondering if I'll get an awesome meal or be disappointed.
0;"Let me start by saying, historically, I like Best Buy. I like what they stand for, I like their products and I like their customer service. For these reasons, when I recently bought a condo and I was in need of a washer, dryer, refrigerator and television, the first place I looked was Best Buy. However, I picked the wrong Best Buy to make my purchase. \n\nThis review is not about ALL Best Buys. This is about the Best Buy on 20th and Camelback. \n\nLike I said, I purchased a washer, dryer and television and the Geek Squad mounting from this Best Buy. \n\nThe washer, dryer and TV were to be delivered on a Saturday morning by 10:30 a.m.  I received the call on Friday confirming my delivery. On Saturday at 10 a.m. the delivery truck arrived, but there was one MAIN problem. They only had the dryer. Where were my TV and washer? Good question. Well, the washer was on a truck that apparently \""broke down\"" while coming from California. Best Buy didn't bother calling me to tell me that my washer wouldn't be delivered. The television was a whole other story. The sales associate apparently filled out the form incorrectly, and so the order was cancelled. Was I called about either of these issues? No. It wasn't until I talked to the delivery company and 3 different people at Best Buy to \""resolve\"" the problem. At this point it was too late to have my items delivered on Saturday and because I work, I had to wait another week to have them delivered.\n\nBut, this saga isn't over yet. When they messed up my order, they PROMISED me I would have my washer and television delivered by 10:30 a.m. the following Saturday since they messed up my order. I had to be somewhere at 11 so it was impertinent it was delivered before then. They said, not a problem and promised it would be there. \nI called the Geek Squad on Thursday to confirm that my TV would be installed and delivered Saturday. They confirmed that the Geek Squad would arrive WITH the TV and install it. \n\nI then got a call from the delivery truck about my washing machine (remember, they promised it would be there by 10:30 am.) They told me the washer would be delivered between 1-3 pm. I had to argue for a half an hour with the manager before he  final \""pulled strings\"" to \""accommodate\"" my original delivery request. \nBut...it's not over yet. \n\nThe second Saturday morning arrives. The washer gets there. Check that off the list. Then, the Geek Squad arrives to install my TV. Remember, they PROMISED me they'd arrive with the TV. Guess what. They didn't. The poor guys had no idea they were supposed to pick up the TV. In fact, I learned that they aren't even allowed to pick up deliveries from this store. So, my installation guys are there and the TV is missing yet again. They did me a HUGE favor and actually drove across town to this store to pick up the TV (shocking fact; these guys don't work at the store on Camelback. They work at the one on Frank Lloyd Wright). So, they go all the way to the Camelback location to pick up my TV....which they learn was about to be shipped to Texas for some random reason. If they hadn't picked up my TV, I'm sure I'd still be missing it today. Was I ever called by Best Buy with an apology? No. \n\nI don't think I need to explain further why I would never shop at this Best Buy again. I bought my refrigerator from the Best Buy on Shea and it went off without a hitch. \n\nSo my Yelp friends, if you want a seamless experience with your pricey purchases of major appliances, I would suggest you shop anywhere but the Best Buy on Camelback and 20th. Not only did they mess up my order on multiple levels, the sales associate staff was rude on top of it. \n\nThis is not the experience you want when you are making a large financial commitment."
0;Kinda helpful. mostly just wanted to sell me on a plan so he told me to check my credit, and that they use soft inquiries (don't show up on credit reports). that was not the case. It showed up on my credit reports. Maybe he believed that it was a soft inquiry and was not educated correctly. either way, these guys hurt my credit report and score.
1;Sushi is of the quality one would expect from an all you can eat.  Not good, but not particularly bad just don't expect any of the fancy rolls you get at non all you can eat places.  The grilled food is loaded with salt and the waiters always make sure your cup of water is filled to the brim - obviously so you eat less.\n$80 for 2 people including tax tip and 2 beers is kind of steep for the quality you get.  Can get regular takeout of much better quality/originality for certainly cheaper price.
0;I have stayed at many 4+ star hotels through  3rd party websites. I have an upcoming reservation for the 4th - 6th of October. \n\nAfter the 3rd party booking I  call the hotel directly to pay separately for suites / upgrades / acommodations etc, and with each prior hotel have been greeted kindly and have been met with the ability to upgrade or make requests. \n\nWith Elara, this is the first time I have been treated as though I dont belong at the hotel due to the 3rd party booking and also the first time that I was informed that they have no alternate options for 3rd party bookings. While the lack of options is not preferred it is the rude customer service that was most shocking. \n\nI will update my review either during or after my stay.\n\nThe hiltons have a good reputation, so far I havent seen it and have lost a lot of excitement for this trip.
0;"Don't valet park your vehicle!  My car battery was somehow dead and they recharged it right before i got my car WITHOUT telling me. I was lucky to get back home without knowing that.  And the next morning i couldn't even start my car.  I found that out cuz the battery positive cover was left opened and apparently someone charged it.   Man what if i got stuck in the middle of nowhere with no battery.   \n\nBy the way I was forced to do valet cuz there was no self parking at this hotel. The closest was guest park but no one was willing to give us clear instruction on where this \""guest\"" parking was. They only told me i could use guest parking \""half a mile\"" walking distance from signature to mgm."
1;I know it is lunch time and I know it is in Oakland, but they only had one person in the kitchen. One person! Our food took 45 minutes to come for a chicken wrap. Not very impressive at all.  The upside, the staff was apologetic and very friendly. I would go back to try it maybe not during the lunch rush, or if they had more people cooking in the back. 45 minutes is too long to wait!
0;What happened to the cinnamon rolls?!?! \nThis afternoon, I had one for the first time since Dozen came under new ownership and it was a mere shadow of their amazing original. The dough was heavy, dry and nearly flavorless (it tasted much like the inside of an unsalted soft pretzel).  The outside of the roll was extremely pale and almost chalky colored, like it had been dusted with flour.  Most disappointing was that instead of the classic pinwheel of gooey, spicy cinnamon throughout, there was only an odd little pattern, which was very mildly flavored and dry.    The only thing that remained the same was the icing (tangy and plentiful) and the size (huge).  \nI used to be tempted to eat myself sick on these, but this time I barely made it through half (I kept waiting for it to get better).  Bottom line: this is NOT the Best Cinnamon Roll of Dozen's heyday, and that's a real bummer.\n It's not even worth it to get into our mediocre brunch entrees.  I'll just get more depressed. Dozen as we knew it is pretty much gone and that's that.  I haz a sad :(
3;I turned the corner and BAM I saw a huge chocolate fountain! So, I thought why not buy some sweets here??\n\nI had the crepes here and they were pretty amazing...I wish I had it them one more time before put I didn't have time.\n\nThe croissants here are so good too...I took some home with me I was pretty excited when I pulled them out for breakfast!!
4;Good for kids they are very kind and friendly
3;"This place isn't a cutsey-adorable as I thought it would be. It's a in a rather ancient looking building, hidden behind a ice cream and print shop. If you didn't know it was a ramen place, the drab decor, empty snack cooler' and the smartass (albeit awesome) \""Burger King\"" sign would've hinted that it was a quaint All-American cafe shop that specializes in coffee and corndogs (Note to self: Make a coffee and corndog shop called \""Cafe Le Woof.\""). Obviously I was new here, so the owner (I believe) came to the rescue and helped me pick a ramen-- very friendly and professional.\n\nI got the (the name escapes me) \""Hawaiian\"" ramen (with fresh ramen). The fresh ramen itself was legit-- now is it truly fresh and authentic ramen? No, but I didn't expect it to be. Lower your standards. I came to the realization many years ago that I will never eat fresh and authentic ramen outside of Japan, but Doodles fresh ramen tasted more like fresh ramen than other ones that I tried, and that's all I really wanted. The soup, spam, and quail egg were amazing, though the cilantro (I think) was straight up overkill. No me gusta, amigo. However, for what it's worth, Doodles fresh ramen is pretty good, and I would not mind eating it again."
2;I give 3 stars ONLY because I love their coconut milk tea with boba. It IS pricey, but obviously worth it for me to keep going back there quite often. \n\nAt Tea Station, the flavor & amount of sugar overpowers the tea taste (which probably isn't good for you health-wise haha) which is why I find their boba sooooo addicting. If you're looking for boba that HAS more of a tea taste, I suggest Volcano Tea instead.\n\nOne thing I dislike is the service. I always order my drink to-go and the waitresses never smile, never greet you, and always have a blank face on... When I pay with cash most of the time they automatically assume the rest is their tip, which you should NEVER do. Because they assume that I owe them something after paying almost $7 dollars for a 16-18 oz. drink ON TOP OF the girls turning around and speaking a different language to their co-workers most likely trash-talking, I probably shouldn't leave a tip. But I do anyways.\n\nOverall, I've heard great things about the food, I LOVE the boba, and the whole atmosphere of the place is nice... Parking sucks though.
3;New Seoul will be at a new location starting Sept. 2014!\n\nI came here one afternoon for lunch and when I walked in my fellow patrons were all Asians. Good sign!!!\n\nI got my all time fav Korean comfort food. Kimchi soup with pork. I wish I could have tried more but there's only so much you can order when you are on your own.\n\nAs per protocol at a Korean restaurant they bring out mini side dishes before your meal starts. There was kimchi (napa cabbage) picked radish, and potato chunks (sweetened).\n\nMy kimchi soup was brought out in a stone bowl which kept nice and hot! I thought it tasted pretty authentic. I definitely think it's the most authentic place I've tried so far in Madison.\n\nIf you order Korean BBQ it looks like they do bring a gas grill out to your table for you to cook your meat. As far as I could tell from observing what another table was eating.
1;Overpriced cafeteria food.
2;"A decent place to hang out on weekend mornings. Decent coffee, tasty bagels, and so-so bagel sandwiches. I've tried several of their sandwiches and been disappointed, but I'd still recommend this location overall. Try the upstairs seating; it's divine."
2;I like it when people i am ordering from are friendlly. One girl at the counter was very rude and the place seems to be pinching pennies. They do not give out water or ranch with the order which was the first let down. So i spent 2 dollars for water and 89 cents for ranch (bummer) it's not the money... it's the point of good service if you order hot wings they should include sauce with the order and charge more not make me add it on .... The girl at the front was rude and kept answering my questions with attitude all the while my Togo took 30 minutes (another bummer). The sauces are good but the manager and food chain needs to have a talk with the people who work at this location (one girl impaticular) As well as including ranch in my order.   \n\nOn a side note only 1 girl was rude but 2 others made up for it at the end. The wings were also really good which is why I'm changing from 2 stars to 3. Drink machine was also a plus
2;You know what's awesome? \n\nChili cheese fries for breakfast to nurse a Vegas sized hangover.
1;I agree with the rest of the reviews.  When I walked by the phone section, the people there always seem to be on point.  The rest of the store....nothing.  Last time I was there I stood in front of the HIGHLY disorganized Wii section for 30 minutes searching for a game.  I never found it, never found someone to help me, and got so frustrated with my experience I walked over to Target to do the rest of my shopping (I was there to buy 3 specific things).  I don't know what is wrong with this particular Best Buy.  I usually get such better service, see better inventory, and would expect something better for the Best Buy that services Uptown.
1;we've eaten here a couple times, but were pretty underwhelmed both times.  the reviews on here sounded promising, and i wanted to give it a chance, which is why we ate there more than once.\nprobably my biggest complaint is that the chicken gets reallllly soggy in the sauce.  we tried several dishes and each one was the same.  i guess maybe its all according to taste.\ni do have to say that i did try the soups, and those were very good.\ni was sad because this place is 2 seconds from the house.
0;First clue was when we heard the sound of the microwave in the kitchen. The homemade drinks were okay. The tamales were microwaved from frozen, so scorching hot difficult to tell the taste. The pupusas were fresh made and looked nice, but they had no true flavor. Had to add salt and their salsa to make edible. Not too bad for price - $2 each. If I were to go back and were stuck hungry in the area I would eat pupusas with salt & salsa, but I would hope that wouldnt happen....  Still $20 for two to eat wasted. The staff was friendly.
2;"No signs to point you in the right direction so had to whip out the YELP app to get guidance.  3rd floor, down the hallway lined with records to the left of China Poblano.  Even at a random off hour of 4pm the wait was about 15 minutes and if you wanted a whole pizza we heard others in line get quoted 2 hours since you can phone head.  We went with  the only two options available, a bell pepper, pepperoni, onion, and 2 slices of mushroom.  The experience is what prevented me from giving this 4 stars but the pizza itself was definitely some of the best i have had. This is the Cosmopolitan after all; aka loud, full of drunk party-goers at all hours, and obnoxious groups still sporting their wristbands from the night before as if they just turned 21.  I felt bad for the workers but they gave back as much as they took.  You can tell they are used to the element that finds its way to Secret Pizza.  We saw people trying to hustle the workers by walking away without paying, people whining that they could not get what they wanted, and drunk fools in line; 4pm remember!, trying to become best friends with the guys behind the counter as they just rolled their eyes as if used to the nonsense.  I think it is a good thing there is no seating really, just four or 5 bar stools. If you could just get your slice and run out it is great!  We actually took our slices next door to Bellagio to enjoy.  Again the pizza is great, i guess if i was in college again i might have brushed off the hordes of drunken twenty-somethings."
4;This has to be one of my all time favorite Carson Street eateries. It's actually in the old library building, very quaint. \n\nI love the menus, they actually hand you a book (my book was Of Mice and Men, my date got the Wizard of Oz) with the menus affixed to the covers. All the small plates, entrees, and sandwiches are titled after classic books. Lord of the Rings, (onion rings) Arabian Nights, (hummus) Peter Pan, (cheese sticks?) and many more. I ordered the plabano pepper stuffed with goat cheese and covered with a creamy chipotle sauce, called Billy Goats Gruff. It was crunchy, creamy and delicious. My date ordered Wings of Icarus, yep, wings done with a dry rub. \n\nFor lunch I had the Alice in Wonderland, a meaty, marinated, then grilled portobello mushroom with Boursin cheese on ciabatta and sweet fries. The portobello took on the texture of a nice piece of tenderloin. Any meat lover would enjoy this and not miss it. The fries were yam fries, crunchy and delicious. My date got adventurous and ordered The Women in White, creamy risotto with mushrooms, which looked fab! This was my fourth visit here, I highly recommend the Library for a nice evening out.
2;Normally visit another Station, but we were in the neighborhood and thought we'd give Palace a try. Got hungry and opted for the cafe. Cafe food is cafe food. The chicken nachos were about what you would expect from a casino cafe. The side salad was fresh and plentiful. The iced tea was fresh brewed and some of the best I've had. Our waiter, Laju, was attentive and friendly. Had better luck at the cafe than I did in the casino, which may alter any thoughts of returning.
1;Like many of the patrons on here, I too, decided to visit this restaurant based on the high reviews.  A couple friends and I decided to stop in for Saturday brunch. They were not extremely busy but we had a longer than average wait time to be seated.  No one besides us were waiting to be seated.  The waitress, which was also the hostess, informed us that they were cleaning a table off for us.  After about 10 minutes we were seated at a table with hair on it.  I will say our server was very pleasant. After placing our order we had to wait another 15 minutes for the food to arrive.  I ordered the French toast which was delicious, however it was only one slice.  Needless to say I was still hungry. In addition 2 out of the 3 checks were miscalculated.  I was thoroughly disappointed and dont think I will be visiting there again.
3;This is one of the newer hotels in Vegas . Everything in the room is remote controlled . The curtains , lights , etc. The room was very nice and clean . The bathrooms were very nice too . The casino was pretty dead and that great . There wasn't much good stores or restaurants in here either .
4;Where do I begin? Hmmm...well...I first tried HDS because i work across the street from them. I always thought it was just okay. They recently came under new ownership/management and that brought them up from 'just okay' to OUTSTANDING. They have really upped the bar! \n\nI've had their sliders, bahamas island dog, chicken fingers, and various other menu items and I've never been disappointed. The condiment bar is WELL STOCKED, I mean TONS of options and I am a girl who likes toppings...and choices. You can get anything exactly how you want it and the food is fresh and flavorful. \n\nFrench fries - perfect balance of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside\nBahamas Island Dog - killer combination of ingredients (onions, chili, mustard, nacho cheese etc)\nChicken Fingers - crispy but not super bready and not super greasy either\nFriend Zucchini - You can actually taste the zucchini as opposed to some fried zucchini i've had where all you taste is the fried grease\nSliders - comes with three of them, more than enough food for a meal, I love dressing them up with the items at the extensive condiment bar.\n\nThe customer service is excellent, the new owner is an absolute doll. The staff is so nice that I would still eat there even if the food was crappy (lucky for me, it's not!). \n\nI honestly can't say enough good to do it justice. Give it a shot for yourself
2;"I was in town for someone's birthday, and she wanted to go to Hooters.  So, I said, \""Chicken wings?  Why not?\""\n\nThe hostess, though visibly taken aback by the request for seating for 15 people, was glad to accommodate us and enlisted some of her orange-shorted compatriots to move tables together.\n\nThe service was fantastic.  Our waitresses were always around, always filling our drink orders, and always getting us whatever we needed.  Our food came out quickly, and our main waitress showed no negative signs of having to deal with such a large party.\n\nI ordered the Wingsday platter--10 boneless chicken wings, french fries, and a choice of ranch or blue cheese dressing.  My specifications were hot wings, sub tots for the fries, and ranch.  Unfortunately, my wings were not hot, and I was ready to sweat that night!  The tater tots were bland and made me regret not getting the fries.  On the plus side, there was plenty of ranch dressing, more than I wanted.\n\nThough the food was just all right, the time spent with family and friends and the friendly waitstaff made this a good experience."
4;It was delicious and the service was great! My boyfriend and I started with the shrimp and pork spring rolls which had an amazing peanut dipping sauce. We also had crispy shrimp egg rolls which were very tasty as well. We ordered one of the specials which was the shaken beef with shrimp and garlic noodles. The seasoning was tasty and the meat was cooked perfectly, so was the shrimp. Everything was delicious. We will be coming back again.
1;"Somewhat regretful that I checked in here. Saw the commercials on the boob tube and agreed  to eat here with some extended family. Other reviewers were ACCURATE in describing this place to be like Hometown, but with a meat grill. IMO, the lines here aren't as bad, as some Yelpers complain, with the exception of the line to actually get into the place. The setup of the place makes it crazy and claustrophobic - a potential goat f*ck during a major dining rush.  Service is attentive and frequent. We got seated around 8pm and left after an hour.  \n\n The \""ice cream\"" is one of those soft serve machines. The kids like the cotton candy station and the chocolate fountain.  If you want steak, go to store, buy meat, and cook it at home or go to a steakhouse.  \n\nThis place focuses on volume first, followed by service and cleanliness, and then quality.  If Las Vegas buffets are in the 2 star (nasto) to 4.5 star range (da bomb), this is a three (meh)."
3;"Most people who know me know that I love food and live to eat! Most people who know me understand that I am slightly eccentric. Most people who know me know that I plan my trips around what and where I am going to eat. So, most people who know me should not be shocked to learn that I drove to Arizona for a hamburger. What Carrie D? You drove to another state just for a hamburger? Are you crazy?\n\nPerhaps I am a bit crazy, but when I read about Culver's I absolutely had to try their burger and custard...so my partner-in-crime (Brian V.) and I booked a hotel, hopped in the Mini, and drove to Arizona. My BFF Forest W. just happens to live in AZ so we picked him up and headed to Culver's.\n\nOnce inside I went all \""fan girl\"" and honestly I think I freaked out the employees at the counter. They seemed genuinely shocked that I drove from another state just to try their food. After they figured out I wasn't dangerous they described the menu items, took our order, and volunteered to take our picture in front of the menu. They were very cool and alot of fun!\n\nWe all had the Three Cheese Triple Butter Burger. Three smash burger patties with American, Swiss, and Cheddar Cheese. It was really good, but did not match the magic of Freddy's Steakburger or Steak & Shake. Definitely a solid 4 star burger though. My two companions shared the fried cheese curds and loved them, in fact Brian V. said he would go back to Culver's just to eat the cheese curds. \n\nFor desert we all had the Flavor of the Day Concrete Mixer which was something involving chocolate custard and snickers...decadent crazy deliciousness! \n\nThank you Culver's for not disappointing this slightly crazy burger fan. By the way, it would be awesome if you could open some stores in Southern California!!!"
0;been to serranos before the quality of their food is gone way down. their chips and bean and salsa dip still is the same thankfully. i got a green chile burro only ate half the meat looked under cooked to me and looked like a supermarket tortilla which tasted a couple days old. the beans are good but the rice is bland to me, i wouldnt call it spanish rice. my wife got a flauta but it was a taquito which was dried out and shriveled. I had better frozen taquitos seriously. we arent going back
1;Food was great as always at OK, but service was pretty bad. Slow to take order, food took nearly 30 minutes with a slim crowd. Never checked back to see how things were or if we needed anything else (we  did). Not bad enough to keep from coming back, just a tad disappointing..
1;I am now aware of the fact that they do not charge covers on the weekends...\n\nThis being the case, I could now possibly see myself dropping by for one cocktail on a Mill avenue binge session, but just one.
1;I hate that I didn't have a better experience because I was really looking forward to eating here. \n\nWe made a reservation and ventured out on a Wednesday night.We were promptly greeted and seated in a booth... and then no one ever came back. We waited and waited and waited. We finally waited so long that I got up and went to the bar because that was the only place I could see any of the staff. I told a waitress we'd been sitting for 15 minutes with no server, and she said she didn't know who ours was, but she'd find out. Apparently our waiter was also the bartender. He was really nice, but trying to find him at any point during our meal was like trying to find a needle in a haystack (until it was time to pay and then he was Johnny on the spot.)\n\nOur food was good - we got beef/ham and cheese empanadas to start, and then I got the Havana Pork with plantains and boiled yucca, and the fella got the Fried Pork with rice and green beans - but our service was so terrible that it colored our whole experience.\n\nTo end on a positive note, they did have live music, which was a nice touch and not too overpowering.
2;"I never thought about the name \"" Irish Pub\"" but the menu is pretty much American. I never knew they had \""Tommy Tots\"" in Ireland maybe that was the cause of the potato famine. Seriously, I like the Tommy Tots and Wednesday night trivia. I go once and a while with a small group of friends and have some food, beer and a pretty good time. Yes it is a gay bar and I have not been downstairs to the bar/club in years so I can not comment on that. Even though the food is not \""Irish\"" just sandwiches, wings, quesadillas and such it is good and reasonably priced."
2;I guess you can say I had high expectations for this place since it I read good reviews about it and the fact it was on the top floor of Palms and I was familiar with Chef Andre's work.  \n\nWe were sat right away after arriving in the middle of the restaurant which I was not a big fan due to the fact I wanted a seat by the window for the view.  Here's what we ordered: \n\nPan Seared Scallops appetizer- 3 scallops?! for 29 bucks?! Hmmm..........no thank you \n12oz Australian Wagyu- Not what I had expected\nand the girlfriend had the Duck which was cooked pretty good. \n\nOverall in a nutshell, probably my first and last time here.
0;"I usually stay at Hampton Inns but thought I would give Doubletree a try since its in the Hilton Family. Myth busted. The Hilton name means nothing!  I was extremely disappointed. \n\nBesides the fact that the layout is terribly inconvenient getting from the lobby to the rooms, there is a very musty, mildewy odor that is hard to get over. I heard it used to be a Wyndam Garden Hotel, but I looked it up on Google Earth and I am pretty sure it was a La Quinta Inn at one time. I suppose if they charged La Quinta prices, I might expect the bad experience I had, but I left $230 poorer for two nights stay, and was expected to pay $9.95 if I wanted to use the Internet. Are you serious? Even that is complimentary at Hampton Inn. At least I got a $25 gas card to ease the blow. \n\nUpon arrival, \""Mr. Bubbles\"" greeted me in monotone, processed my credit card, and said \""here are your cookies and your gas card.\"" That was awkward - it was as if I had asked for or even knew I was getting the cookies. Just \""here's your cookies\"" Not - we see you've traveled a long way - here are some warm cookies to brighten your day. So, I try to remain positive, I think, maybe its me, maybe I'm just tired....I go to my room. \n\nI enter the 2nd floor hallway and notice a blood stain, a large blood stain on the carpet in the hall just before I get to the room that completely weirded me out. I stayed in room 218. The room appears to be well-appointed but upon further inspection I notice the back of the flat painted hollow-core bathroom door was filthy, and the wallpapered light switch cover was equally filthy. Yuck! I was so grossed out! The caulking around the tub looked like a 6 year old did it. \n\nAfter close inspection, I crawl in bed. The bed was the most ridiculously uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in, unless you count the pull out couch I stayed on once as a kid. I locate the remote and discover that there is no Food Network or HGTV or any of the other basic cable channels you might expect...are you serious! \n\nThere is so much hallway noise in this property, its just retarded; the kids running up and down the halls could be remedied if there was security present. This is not the hotels fault but there were people talking in the hallway at all hours like they live in a barn. There are huge gaps under the doors - maybe when they tore out the old 1972 shag carpet, it left a space and they never did anything about it. Hey, Doubletree, here's a clue: replace the doors with ones that fit for the sake of your guests. \n\nIMPORTANT TIP: The first night I forgot to set the thermostat fan to ON and heard planes coming in till all hours. Three thirty in the morning, I'm screaming BE QUIET!!! as my neighbors on the second floor apparently leaving to catch early flights forget some people are still sleeping. I recommend you DO NOT choose this hotel unless your only other choice is sleeping on the streets of Charlotte. If you do stay here, set the fan to the permanently ON position and leave your TV on low volume for white noise. \n\nAdding insult to injury, I woke up the first morning with a bite mark in my right forehead hairline -- do not have a clue what THEE HECK that was all about. My skin crawls to think about it. I still havent ruled out that I have hitchhikers.\n\nAs I was leaving, I encountered several of the housekeeping staff cluttering the walkway near the elevators. They stared and commented to each other that \""everybody is trying to get outta here\"" I said good morning, and they replied and stared as my daughter and I struggled with our belongings. Not one staff person ever offered a hand. I passed my \""parting thoughts\"" survey across the counter to the man at the front desk - and told him he was the first person to have smiled since I checked in two days ago. He said \""oh no\"" and I said \""oh yes\"" and out the door we went. \n\nI come to Charlotte about once a month, but I will never stay there again! BEWARE!!!! Doubletree Charlotte Airport is DoubleGross! Zero stars!"
1;Been to  Benihana's a couple of times, but this last visit was a complete disaster.  The table next to us was seated 10 minutes after we were, and they got their drinks, soup, salad, and food before us.  They also left 40 minutes before our table did.\n\nOur waiter apparently failed at being a chef, and decided to try his luck serving.  He didn't know the menu, he asked me three times about the Salmon Nigiri that I ordered, twice confusing it for sake.  It's a Japanese restaurant, you'd think he'd have basic sushi nailed down.    Instead of serving his single table, he was singing happy birthday to a few other groups.  The fried rice was literally....fried.\n\nAfterwards I spoke with the Manager.  I'm usually not one to complain, and I wasn't rude or anything, but just wanted to bring up the situation to management.  He wasn't surprised at all, and even told me that he knew this particular server was lagging...horribly.  For the life of me I can't figure out why NO ONE stepped in to help the poor guy throughout our 2 HOUR dinner fiasco.  No trainer, no help, nada.\n\nI can tell you I won't be back until I get my free birthday meal, but even then, for the price I'll pay just for my spouse's meal, I'll consider a number of places before stopping here again.
0;"NO RUNNING WATER IN MY HOTEL ROOM. I flew to Las Vegas for a business trip. I checked into the MGM Grand hotel on Sunday, July 22, 2012. After around 5 hours later of checking into the hotel room and returning back to the room (from the trade show that I attended) there was a red light flashing on the hotel phone. It was a voicemail message letting me know that the whole wing that I was staying in would have no running water tomorrow, the next day between 11am-4pm. \nHow could they check people into a hotel room with no running water? \nI called front desk and spoke to a very nice gentleman who transferred my call to a different department that handled my reservation.  I spoke to a woman (named (De****) and asked if we could be moved to another room because of no running water. De**** told me that I should call back in the morning to see if there would be any non-smoking room available.  I checked out early and ended up staying at a different hotel because of the front desk employee downstairs (letter starts with La*****\"") who was so rude about helping me find a different room."
0;"I've been ordering two or three times a week for about a year. They have really been going downhill.  The food has been arriving cold and they screw something up on every order. I called them and they are so very rude, even to a regular customer.  I'm done. There are too many places in Madison to put up with it. I guess they haven't grown with their business. I don't know what the problem is; but I'm moving on...\n\nEd"
0;I honestly don't get how this place has been open for so long. \n\nI never heard good things but being stuck waiting for a bus got me here. A friend and  I enter were greeted 15 mins later. No one was there. \n\nI order a soda and a sandwich. Friend orders a beer and wings. \n\nSoda did not taste right- the server said yeah the bag has to be changed. It took 10 more minutes, but finally it tasted right. The beer was not very cold. \n\nBut the food was awful. It just seemed microwaved and that too poorly. I did not even finish my sandwich.  \n\nThe server was nice, thats the only positive I can say.
0;"I spent 2 days in August laying out in Tao Beach. The first day wasn't bad because it was a Thursday and there were very few people. This review is mainly based on my experience Friday. Weekday or not, though; I wouldn't return. I'd expect more class from the Venetian. I'd imagine that what Tao Beach has become is part of the reason why they opened the new adult pool at the Palazzo, Azure. Azure was very nice, but boring. They just play trance music, which I suppose is their way of keeping out the \""urban\"" crowd which frequents Tao beach. The Venetian/Palazzo should just do what Mandalay does at Moorea Beach Club, which is charge an exorbitant cover for men and some girls (excluding the hot ones).\n\nHere's my review: This place is a cesspool for disease and filth. If you are over the age of 23, not trashy, or have any sense at all then do not go here. I can't say enough bad things about this place. And all the good reviews on here shows you just how many classless people there are in this world. \nLet's start with the crowd: If your coming here expecting to see hot girls topless, don't bother. The girls with their tops off are the ones that should have had them on most. So many chubby boobs! If you are not wearing Ed Hardy, you will be in the minority. Enough said? Not yet. The people who come here are super annoying. It's the bachelor(ette) party crowd staying 15 to a room. So loud, trashy, and obnoxious.   \nPool: It's tiny and DISGUSTING! You can't even see you're feet if you're standing in it. Gross and murky with suntan oil, spilled drinks, bodily fluids...you name it.\nAnother awfully annoying thing was that they were letting in people who were fully dressed and just wanting to \""check it out\"". Other than the creep factor of this, it's extra irritating because the area is already crowded enough with people who are there to layout or hang in the pool. \nYuck is all I've got left to say."
2;I have been to Steinberg Diagnostic medical imaging centers it was, if anything medical is possible, pleasant.
1;Hmmmm...I started out reading other reviews of this place and I'm thinking that maybe a 2nd visit is in order.  Our experience was definitely not like others.\n\nWe stopped by here for lunch.  $5 lunch special includes your entree, 2 scoops of rice, veggies and a small drink.  We both got the BBQ chicken ... the boneless chicken portion was small, the rice was good and  the veggies consisted of cabbage (and that's it!).\n\nWe were greeted by a woman on the phone who hung up only long enough to take our order and then returned to the phone.  Since we were the only ones in the place (at 12pm!!), I wondered if her conversation was meant to be entertainment?\n\nConsidering this place is next door to several other really good restaurants, I can't help but wonder why anyone would choose this particular establishment instead of one of the others?\n\nAmple free parking, cause it's a shopping center.  Would we return? I don't know.  Would I recommend?  I just don't know.\n\nIf we decide to give this place a second chance, I'll update my review.
3;K, Its acutally a 3.5 but we ll round it up to 4.\nDont really know what the hype is all about. This was argualbly one of the most expensive meals I ve had, however, Cant really say that it was my favourite. As a matter of fact, Gf would give it a 5, and I would give it a 3, so here we are at 4!\nWe went for the tasting menu like others and to be honest, the best part was getting to watch the chef making and preparing the food. Food was tasty, however, I cant say that it was worth the money that I paid for it. \nIf you wanna impress your significant other, by all means go to this place, however If you are not from Vegas, chances are for the money you are spending here, u can get alot better stuff back home.
3;Last time I visited Gilley's I came to eat in the restaurant, this time I came to hang out in the other half of the building with the live music, dance floor and mechanical bull. \n\nI'm not shy about being a country music lover and as far as nightlife goes, this is definitely the place for me. It's not too crowded, there are actually plenty of seats and the dress code (if there even is one) is more boots and flannel than high heels and dresses. \n\nOn Friday night, there was live music, which was nice. The singer covered many popular country songs, from the classics (Johnny Cash) to modern country (Jason Aldean) and fast-paced dance tunes to slow songs. \n\nBut when the singer took a break and the recorded songs came on, I found it odd that non-country songs were mixed in. This is a country bar after all and I came to listen to country music.
0;We bought a Living social deal or was it a Groupon deal?Either way the Value was 54dollars and i bought the coupon for 26(didnt think it was a Bad deal at all)Untl we got there-The Menu is as expensive as all get out,then the portion sizes are so small not filling at all.My husband said he could have popcorn when he got home coz he was still hungry(all bad)The food display is pretty but am not there to look at food,am there to eat it.Alcohol prices are prohibitve.All in all I thought It was a good way to try a local spot by a local,but the only thing they made is LOCO!My recommendation is not patronize this establishment,if you have to bring deep pockets and light stomach.\nMy husband and I will not,I repeat will not be returning to this establishment at all.Not even if we win a Jackpot at that Casino!
1;Cafe Roma just went downhill since it has been in the Arizona Center for the last decade. They have whole pizzas ready and when you order a slice they reheat it in the oven for you, not a bad idea but then I saw a fly crawling on the pizzas right in front of me so I chose not to get a pizza. I chose the ziti which was okay the cheese didn't really taste like anything and the sauce was just weird. It came with a salad which was laughable because it was literally just two small pinches of salad with an overdose of dressing. I don't think I will be back here again after having been a long time customer.
2;Good wings. Good Service.
3;Went for my husband's Christmas party. First time visit and enjoyed our dinner & experience. Best calamari i have ever had. We both had steaks - mine was a little undercooked & could have used a little more salt but still yummy. I enjoyed 3 different martini's. My favorite by far was the Southern Peach!! S'mores was pretty good.
2;"Lima Limon sits in a desolate shopping center off of Decatur Blvd. It is next door to a Port of Subs. You will see the bright yellow/green sign and then enter into what is definitely 1950s diner vibe. Not sure what that is about - but maybe they are just waiting to revamp.\n\nService was exceptionally nice. I believe this place is definitely a mom-n-pop place as the waiter took great pride in talking to myself and my co-worker about the types of food, how it is made, etc. He even brought out an iPad so we could scroll through and see what the dishes looked like before we ordered.\n\nI've never had Peruvian food before. The menu is straight and to the point. Most meals are simple: a meat, a carb, and a few veggies. In fact, some dishes come with both fries AND rice. It is somewhat reminiscent to me, of Hawaiian food, that comes with macaroni salad AND rice. However, Peruvian food obviously has an Asian-influence as I could distinctly taste soy sauce, and the \""pasta\"" that came with my dish was very much like noodles you may find in an Asian dish.\n\nI ordered the Tallarines Saltado with chicken. This is a BIG dish of food. Noodles were cooked perfectly, and chicken was good. Very few vegetables though - I thought I would get more tomatoes, but there were only two in my dish. Overall, the meal was good, but not great. Not sure if this is just because of the Peruvian dish itself - or the restaurant.\n\nI would like to try Peruvian food elsewhere to see how it compares. For now, an A-OK will do."
0;Definitely only deserves one star. The cupcakes seem cute, but they were just super dry. One of the worst I've ever had. Avoid it if you can.
4;So good! I got the Lobster & Shrimp Macaroni and Cheese and it was AMAZING! A large portion though, enough for 2 to share! Not too rich but perfect comfort food! Burgers look very good and well-made, as well as all of the salads! Definitely recommend this place!
0;This place is overhyped. \n\nThe service is awful. Order a dill pickle & get a sour. Order turkey and get smoked meat. Basically you are given whatever the server is in the mood to give you. \n\nAnd the smoked meat is rather bland. Perhaps I am spoiled coming from NY and being surrounded by some of the best delis in the world but my personal opinion is that the meat at Schwartz is mediocre at best. Not worth the wait or hassle.
3;Had dinner here with a colleague last night.  It is very close to my office and we seem to find our way in at least 3 or 4 times a month for lunch or dinner. \n\nHad my first disappointing meal here in over 3 years of coming in.  What I had isn't really important other than to say it was way over cooked.  Burnt in fact.  And so tough i could hardly chew it.\n\nSo why the 4 stars?  Because of the way they handled the situation.  The waitress checked in after I had given my best and ate about half of the meal.  I told her about the situation and after apologies, brought the manager over immediately.  He offered to replace the meal without even making me repeat my complaint.  As I had already eaten appetizers, soup (both of which were great) and half the entree I said no, that would not be required and thanked him for the offer.  At this point I was satisfied with the attention because as I said, this was my first disappointment and everyone has a bad day now and then.  He then stated he would remove the entree from our bill without me saying another word.  He graciously apologized, thanked us for our business, and said he hoped we would come in again.\n\nNow THAT's great service.
0;The worst Fills over been to. Trash was not emptied. Windshield cleaner was out.  Squeegee was old.  Terrible
1;"My best suggestion is to stop reading the yelp reviews and not go into Sterling brunch with super high expectations. But if you want to keep reading anyway, here's my review...\nI called the number online, which ended up being harrahs' restaurant res. The guy had never even heard of the Sterling brunch (typical harrahs). I had to ask to be transferred to the steakhouse and the hostess i dealt with was great. I didn't have to out down a credit card tol hold the res like others had mentioned. \nArrived for our res at noon and there were only a couple of parties waiting before us. Reviews had mentioned that they give you champagne while you wait, but I only saw a couple discarded glasses, no one waiting had any. It was a really dark and dreary bar area with elevator music playing. Thankfully we were seated after about 15 min. \nThe steakhouse was really old school - lots of dark wood, heavy chairs on rollers, dark heavy fabrics. Probably not somewhere I'd go for dinner w all the other more fun steakhouses. Our waiter Mario was great, very attentive. It was a little hard to understand his thick accent, but he was nice and topped off our champagne at every opportunity. Doesnt matter to me but fyi - they don't seem to serve Evian water anymore. Its looks to be just regular tap.  \nOn to the food - they must have the same menu every Sunday because I basically had what everyone else has mentioned. But they seem to have been a victim of cost cutting. There was no sushi, which is fine since every person mentioned that it sucked anyway. Caviar was available only upon request thru the waiter - a small serving with crostini, creme fraiche, chopped egg, onion and capers. Delicious! We got tiny little blinis w our 2nd order, but not the first. Awesome topped w creme fraiche and lobster. Yum!\nLobster tails were in halves, and didn't look nearly as appetizing as the pics I'd seen on here. I get what they mean about the lobster getting rubbery as it sits there, but it was still really good. Filets were cooked perfectly, there were also braised boneless short ribs which weren't anything special. \nChilean sea bass was so rich, be sure to get some of the jumbo scallops and risotto in the middle. The meat ravioli and lamb stew seemed out of place, and were just mediocre. Didn't try the prime rib because it looked dry. Lamb chops were cooked perfectly and juicy but they weren't slicing them to order - I could tell by the color on the outside that it had been sliced and sat out for a bit. But still delicious w mint jelly. \nKing crab legs were warm. Which is a nice change but that also seemed to have sat in the chafing dish a bit too long. The legs were huge, but some were really dried out. The legs were broken off at the joints but were not precut. We were given 1 of those nut cracker types for the table. The can opener looking crackers would've been a better choice since theirs just squished the legs w out actually cracking open anything. The waitors also don't seem to crack the legs for you as I read in another review. See what I mean about yelp giving you preconcieved notions/out of date info?\nThe ice bar had the usual fare - raw oysters (didn't try them), snow crab claws (watery from being pre frozen) and colossal shrimp cocktail. Shrimp was huge and yummy, cocktail sauce could've used more horseradish. \nI skipped the breakfast stuff as it looked like nothing special - mini waffles, omelette station, bacon, sausage, eggs benedict and fritatta.\nOn to desserts... I think a lot of the pics on here are out of date - they don't have that tall 4 shelf display, its been cut down to 2 shelves. And dessert was honestly the worst part of the meal. That's the first time I've ever said that about a buffet. There were no cakes, pies, or even creme brulee. I don't know what anything was because there was no signage and the chef said \""I don't know, I usually work the hot side.\"" It was just a huge disappointment to end the meal that way. I'll try to remember what they had - the worst tapioca pudding I've ever had (pearls were hard), stale mini cream puffs w overly sweet filling, blah lemon tart, fudge, brownie topped w raspberries, weird berries and clear jelly thing, and the one good thing as a chocolate mousse. That was seriously all they had to offer. For a Vegas buffet that's pretty pathetic and for the price of this buffet, that's a joke. \nMaybe its my high expectations that affected my experience, but I'm really disappointed w Sterling buffet overall. It may have been awesome before, but unfortunately doesn't seem to be anymore. I'd suggest going to another brunch and just dealing w cheaper champagne, or better yet just buy a couple bottles of Perrier jouet. Its pretty bad when you're as drunk as we were and you still don't think the food is amazing."
2;Just went to this small restaurant for the first time today, It will certainly not be my last visit, I may adjust star rating after further trips. The food was excellent as was the portion size. Very attentive staff. A large selection of Asian beers with more to follow I am told.\nPricing was fair. If you like Asian food and curry you will not be disappointed.
0;do not come here horrible gym, staff harassment specially when your husband trying to help you out. parking horrible, gym is basically a meat market. staff rude, dirty disgusting gym.and no free wifi trainers jealous with their CLIPBOARD
3;"Went here on our last night in Vegas over Memorial Day weekend. It was a Saturday night, we had a reservation but still not very crowded. Service was so-so. The waiter was attentive when he was talking to us, but didn't come around very often. \n\nOther than that, this place is absolutely delicious. \n\nTheir chicken meal is quite possibly the best I've had in my entire life! The green bean side is delicious, especially with the touch of almond. My date enjoyed the prime rib and said it was amazing. Left very satisfied, but not \""too\"" full - we pretty much stopped being hungry the moment we got to vegas, because there is so much food and drink we were always eating! I can't comment on the wine/beer/drink because, looking out at the floor where they're free, we couldn't stomach paying upwards of $10-15 a pop. The prices here are a little high, but at the end, the food was so good we didn't even care. Delicious! Might come back next time we're in Vegas!\n\nAlso, the place is really cool looking inside! Great decoration, aside from being smack against the casino floor."
2;I don't know what happened. Maybe I caught them on a bad day. Maybe I just have higher standards.\nAs soon as I got there, I felt that I was rushed to order. This was my first time there and didn't get much chance to look at the menu before my order was taken so fast that I didn't have a chance to add anything else on. When I got to the cashier I was able to add on the other items I wanted but with a lot of attitude from the girl at the register.\nThe food came pretty quickly, which was nice, and the sandwich was really good. The tomato soup, however, was really the worst I've had anywhere with very stale tasting croutons.\nNot too bad of a place to eat, but the staff definitely need to work on their attitude and customer service. (That being said, I seem to run into a lot of this in Vegas. Maybe it's just the customary atmosphere...)\nIf you get a chance, I would highly recommend Panera Bread instead.
2;I preface this review by noting that I'm not an expert in Asian or Chinese cuisine. I'm new to this. This place is hit or miss. They have a lot of great dishes, but they also have a lot of not so great dishes. I enjoyed the kung pao chicken and the beef roll. I was NOT a fan of the 5 spice beef. My girl warned me, but I proceeded to order it anyway. Yuck. The sesame noodles were pretty good too. The service is spotty at best. It's hard to get someone's attention to get refills on water and tea and our vegetable dish came out at the end of our meal, after we were already done with all of our main dishes. I think it would have been better if they timed the dishes a little better than that. Also, the temperature inside the restaurant is kept unnaturally cold, so I was little put off by that. Overall, I was satisfied and the price is right. I just have to learn what dishes to order and stick with that.
4;OMG!!!! \n\nWhat happens when Thai food meet AMAZING? It's Nittaya's Hidden Kitchen.  This small local restaurant is a pleasant surprise!!
3;"Let's start with the place. Beautiful. Open, comfortable. The bar is also great. I was waiting at the bar and saw a lot of people having fondue, very elaborated hand crafted cocktails and having a great time.\n\nWhen my party arrived we tried several dishes. All of them really good. I was hoping to try the pork belly but nobody voted for that. I'll be back soon to try it, the fondue and the \""super yummy nuts\"".\n\nThe chopped salad was very good and very unique in flavor and texture.\n\nThe duck ramen was tasteful and with a final spicy kick. Just be aware, it's a large serving. \n\nThe wild fiji tuna was also very good.\n\nThe balsamic meatloaf was original and tasteful but again, be aware, the serving is very large. I would order it without the rice or it would be good a creamy grana padano risotto, but that's just my preference.\n\nMy favorite dish was the tomato soup. Hands down.\n\nBread pudding was tasteful and the smoke tea chocolate pot the creme was pretty unique. I liked it but if you don't like smoky tastes, this is not for you. \n\nA great addition to the neighborhood.\n\nCheers"
0;This place came recommended highly by someone I met at a near-by raw food restaurant, although I'm not sure how or why anyone would recommend this place.\n\nWe showed up to the yoga studio in plenty of time for class to start only to find we were late for a class that was just beginning. They guy at the front desk informed us that the online schedule was either for the previous or following week. ((I don't remember which one??!))\n\nI've never experienced a yoga studio more stinky than this one - and I've been to plenty of hot yoga studios. Why does this place smell so bad???\n\nThe yoga mats this place provided were disgusting -- I'm still in disbelief that I actually used one.\n\nThe studio looks old and outdated -- it did not feel clean at all. I would definitely not walk around barefoot or naked in the locker rooms. \n\nI am not new to yoga, but a friend of mine that was with me was new. The instructor never once came over to help re-position her into the correct stances. Disappointing. \n\nThe instructors looked out of shape - major turn off.\n\nI would never go back to this place. \n\nI'll never forget that stench.
2;My meal, including wine, appetizer, soup, and the walnut salmon entree were all solid and it came in under $40.  The average entree here costs $15.  In D.C., I couldn't get a sandwich, chips and a drink for that during lunch hour.  But by Pittsburgh standards for good food at low prices, this is pretty typical.    \n\nThe service was sharp, if a little slow (Saturday night and they were busy, so you have to cut them a little slack).  As a whole, they are really trying, with specials galore, and lots of fancy cocktails which I didn't  try.  \n\nSeriously, this place is not expensive and you get a good quantity of food, they're not stuck up, and my generous $6 pour of wine was smooth but not awesome.  I will probably go back again.
3;I've been going to LuLus since they first opened I was excited because to get food like this you have to travel out of our area. I'm writing this for people who have never tried Hawaiian food or eaten here.  The food has been consistent since day 1. Fast service, I usually get BBQ chicken plate, chicken served on sliced cabbage side of rice and macaroni salad. Typical Hawaiian plate. Also get chicken Katsu curry, it's panko fried chicken thighs in Japanese curry sauce with rice and macaroni salad. Great prices. I also get Thai tea boba it's good, a little too sweet but good. Taro boba doesn't taste a strong as other places make it maybe because it's super slushy but still good. Saimin soup is good too. And what Hawaiian doesn't love Spam. Spam musubi, spam and rice wrapped in seaweed, its an all time favorite. Good prices big portions.
0;"If I could rate this 0 stars I would. I joined this gym right when I found out I was moving to AZ, only a few days later I found out I was instead moving to LA. The staff is totally not helpful when it comes to canceling. You need 60 days (which, really though? Why do they need two months to prepare for you to not be a member anymore), but if you aren't able to come into the location, you have to send a CERTIFIED letter. Living with no car makes this extremely difficult to do. I even went into the actual location TWICE trying to cancel but a manager has to be in and if you work during the day, you're pretty much never going to get to see a manager. These people feel like stubborn crooks. It's like, dude, just throw me a freakin' bone here ONCE. I've paid for 6 months and my stupid \""maintenance fee\"" y'all tack on there every few months. You've profited plenty off me. Just leave me be.\nI wanna quit the gym!"
2;"(Lyrics - Deep Blue Something - Breakfast at Tiffany's)\n\nI'll say, we should go to Chompies\nA coffee ground to start with\nOr we'll start to fall asleep\nI'll say, Adam from Man vs. Food was here\nHe did the sliders challenge and lost\nStill I know you just don't care\n\nAnd I said what about Breakfast at Chompies?\nShe said I think I remember that show\nAnd as I recall I think, we both kind o' liked it\nAnd I said well that's, the one thing we've got\n\n\nChompies has been serving East Coast style breakfast in the valley since 1979!  Located close to ASU Campus this place is packing with tradition and memories.  \n\nBreakfast is served throughout the day.  Pick up some fresh made pastries and bagel on your way in or out!  Last first time came I ordered he All American Breakfast -- YUMMY! Crispy bacon, warm turkey sausage, crispy hash browns, and over easy eggs. I'm a sucker for good breakfasts.  The 2nd time I came I ordered the Breakfast of Champions.  Let's just say I wasn't a champion this time around.  I finished my eggs and bacon, but man those pancakes or ginormous!  I think I ate 1/3 even though I was trying to carb load for my run that day.  Eaters be aware; the portion sizes hard HUGE!  \n\nThe place itself is made like a deli shop.  I don't think much has changed since the open since it seem pretty dated.  It was fun searching for the different Broadway plays painted on the walls which brought back great memories.\n\nOur service was excellent and the waitress seems to know a lot about the large menu.  Yes, not only were the portions huge....the menu itself was HUGE!  First timers I would definitely stay with breakfast.  You can't go wrong there! - Enjoy!"
0;Update from last time, Still freaking hate it. \nThe fact that we walked by a group of people that were doing gospel like prayers in the middle of the store while a women was in heavy meltdown, major crying moment, makes me question. WHAT THE HECK IS THIS PLACE!  Of course to each there own, I judge not, but it makes  it awkward to shop there when you need to get a shirt and some one is having a religious moment. \nI agree with every one, this is one ghetto strange wal-mart.
2;Good tasting food in a really beautiful location.  So why the 3 stars?  Well, the price is just out-ray-geous (something like $350 for 4 people for brunch).  And while I probably would have sucked up the price as part of the woooo Vegas experience, the fact that the brunch is a buffet really makes it unjustifiable.  Fine, it's 3.5 stars but as Yelp doesn't have half stars I'm rounding down because of the price.
4;I recently had a terrific experience with Brian at Selberg Electric. I was in a pinch when another valley company canceled on my wife and I on the last days of our home inspection, and we found Selberg on Yelp. Although Brian initially informed me he was booked solid for the day, he promptly gave me the names of TWO other electricians he trusted.  Not many business would be willing to send you to competition let alone two other competitors! Well the other guys couldn't help me either, apparently good electricians are hard to come by on short notice! I called back Selberg and scheduled him for a couple days out. Brian was professional and punctual on the day he came out to estimate as well as when he came back to complete the work. Once completed, he walked me through exactly what had been done and all of his work was extremely thorough. I'm very satisfied with my experience with Selberg. Brian was friendly, professional definitely knew his stuff! His prices were very reasonable as well, I will be using him again to change out my light fixtures!
4;Great happy hour specials. Lots of food selections and drinks . A good mix of food as well
2;I've been coming here for a while - mostly pick up orders and the occasional dine in, and the level of customer service and quality of food has declined. They can't afford to lose that when the parking here already sucks.
1;My husband and I both had the Classic English Afternoon Tea, which came with 4 sandwiches, scones, dessert pastries and our choice of tea.\n\nUnfortunately, whoever designed the dishes clearly only cared about presentation (which, to be fair, was beautiful). Our Black Forest ham sandwiches was slathered with too much mayo and there was a goat cheese with caramel wafer combination that was inedible. The desserts were adorably decorated, but turned out to be insanely sugary in the toothache/assault on your senses kind of way, and we didn't finish a single pastry.\n\nThe highlight of our meal was the tea, which was good, but not great. Nothing else was notable in the positive sense.\n\nWe left the place hungry and grumpy.\n\nSkip this unless you don't particularly want to enjoy food with your tea service and value appearance over function.
0;Something has changed at the Bagel Cafe and it is not good!\nAll new faces jerry the manager and most of the old staff is gone \nWaited 45mins to get seated when they had empty tables \nOwner walks around in a daze doesn't know what's going on \nMaybe time to retire \nGot seated and waited another 10 mins b-4 any one came by \nWon't be coming back here any time soon \nUse to be a great place sorry to see it go down like this \nTime to fine a new deli
3;Love the old school Vegas vibe of this place.  It's like someone could get whacked at anytime here...in a good way!!\n\nWent with the house specialty, osso buco and loved every tender bit of it!  Too bad you can't order extra marrow on the side.  I feel guilty eating veal for about 30 seconds and get over it.  \n\nThe cocktail lounge is awesome.  This would definitely be the place to get a martini.  Too bad for me I go looney after 3 and wanted to remember this meal.  They had a duet cranking out all the oldies which really took you back to a different time in Vegas.  Good stuff.  \n\nI'll still reserve Ferraro's as the best Italian place I've been to in LV but the ambiance and food really make this place one of a kind around here.
0;ghetto walmart from hell\n\nstore is actually pretty nice inside\n\nstaff is friendly\n\nbut....... the creepy people that approach you in the parking lot are enough to keep me from ever coming here again\n\nseriously a minimum of two people are lurking next to your car when you come out, and they are quick to get nasty with you if you don't have any change to give them
1;Highly anticipated (by me), rather disappointed in execution.\n\nI need to stop falling for the chicken croquettes! They are NOT the same as what you get in Spain.  Bland and not cheezy.  They were identical to the ones I had at Bazaar in LA.\n\nThe best dish was their risotto with mushrooms and manchego.  The calamari dish (small whole squid) was juicy and tender.\n\nThe deconstructed seafood stew, lobster skewers with pinapple and the coco chorizo were all severely disappointing - really unmemorable, boring items.
0;First and Last time eating here.\n\nI ordered a takeout order that was said to take 15-20 minutes.  I showed up about 20 minutes after I placed my order.  I had very quick service when it came to ringing me up and paying.  Then I waited, thinking my food would be ready soon.  \nIn total it took about 50 minutes from the time I ordered to get my food.  While I was waiting I was not recognized by any of the staff, only in the way as far as I could tell.  The one very disturbing thing I did see that, more than just the general uncleanliness of the restaurant, would make me not go back, was that one of the waiters (who appeared to be the manager), came out of the kitchen with an entr\u00e9e he was about to take to one of the tables, grabbed a fork from over where the dirty dishes were (I only hope the fork he took was from a clean pile, b/c they had been putting dirty dishes in that area since I got there), and scraped off parts of the noodle dish into the trash before taking that plate to one of the tables.\n\nThe food itself was on par in my opinion with Little Dumplings and several of the other local thai places I have visited in the area as far as the Pad Thai is concerned (had 7 star spicy).  I only hope this was a one time incident b/c that was the first time I had ever seen anything like that happen in a restaurant (though other restaurants may do the same, but I had never seen that before).\n\nI hope I just visited them in an off night, but there are enough other places in the area I could go that I will not be going back to Thai Basil.
4;You had me at vegan baffles and almond milk. nom nom nom. Two things which are very hard to find, especially in Vegas. The boyfriend got The Hof (he's the carnivore) which was this pretzel bun with roast beef, arugula, cheese and agave-mustard sauce and loved it. I had two vegan waffles with macadamia nuts and strawberries with an almond milk latte. I also got the kale salad to go and it was really good. Not too heavy on the dressing. Just perfect.\nReally cute spot. Not the same boring menu you see everywhere. Very attentive service, good prices. Really happy I found this spot. Taste buds happy :)
1;I've gone to this specific location a few times out of convenience, but not any more. My most recent trip was mostly a complete waste of time. I asked for a simple balance service, and they only made it worse. The only thing keeping me from giving one star, is the fact that I didn't have to pay (rightly so, as they mounted the tires/rims to begin with).\n\nThe store on 99th and McDowell is far superior in customer service and technician quality. They properly balanced my tire and made the problem go away. Turns out a couple of wheels were more than 2oz off... maybe the Dysart store needs to calibrate their machine.
0;Dropped waaaay off.  Been going here several times a year for years. Loved it for all, until now. The food is good not great like it was, the sides are bleh. It wasn't that one dish was worse, which I might think that's an off might no big deal, but every dish was just meh.. And the portion sizes shrunk, the dessert was maybe a quarter the size it used to be, a total joke. Top it all off, the manager is a putz, all the good managers and service staff that used to work here are gone. The food is 3 stars (down from 5), but the prices are high so on that basis I'm giving it one star.
4;Let me start off by saying WOW! Everything you've read about this place on Yelp is true. It is an adrenaline rush like no other. The whole experience is a must for anyone looking for that unique Vegas adventure. It all starts with the pick up and drive in a real military Hummer. As you roll down the Las Vegas strip your anticipation builds and upon arrival the compound is full of military gear, vehicles, helicopters and more. The staff is incredibly friendly and nowhere near as douchey as the competition in the area. So let's talk guns...holy smokes! They have the biggest selection of weapons in Vegas that's for sure and many packages to choose. I picked the Modern Warfare pack and let me tell you, I wanted more. You can add anything after your done so don't worry. Staff is super friendly, helpful and very experienced. Never rushed and they even let you load and handle the guns properly. Big thanks to Steve. That man knows his guns. I could go on forever but take my word...JUST GO. SHOOT!!! An adventure worthy of any bucket list. Trust me. I've tried other ones and this has now become my favorite spot. I will be back.
4;"This place has an AWESOME happy hour! 4 - 7 $3.00 beers. In tall, chilled, 16 oz glasses! Not like those other places that announce happy hour and actually charge $2.00 for 8 oz beer glass! \n\nThey also serve $.50 wings and $1.50 sliders during happy hour! What else could you ask for, for a quick \""me\"" time after work?"
2;So this is your basic Wal Mart.  We were visiting from out of town and needed some supplies.  Typical prices, cluttered aisles, and limited service.  Nice supply of food items at decent prices.  Checkout was not an issue.  I've seen much worse.  An OK choice.
4;I eat Mexican food almost every day of the week and this restaurant is hands down on my top 5 list of favorite places! I live in Cali and when I come to Vegas I eat here over all the fancy restaurants and buffets!!! All the servers are there for the customers and the food comes out fast and fresh !!! Best shrimp ceviche hands down !!!! I can't wait to go back to Vegas so I can get my grub on!
3;first of all, we got an amazing seat on the patio with a front row view of the bellagio water show.  we've seen it a hundred times, but for some reason, it was so much better while sitting here eating a delicious dinner.  the ambiance is cool...kinda loud inside and looks very crowded.  but we are here to review the food.  the chocolate bread was awesome...i hate it when i like the bread, cuz i just fill up on that.  we also got the portobello flatbread.  the crust was a tad soggy in the middle, but it was very tasty!!  the greek style romaine, was good.  a little too much dressing.  entrees....butternut squash tortelli.  my husband liked it better than i did.  i thought it was a little too sweet.  i got the rib eye.  i don't know why i always get steak wherever i go.  it was solid, but i've had better.  i guess i shouldn't get steak unless i'm at a steakhouse.  oh well.  their cocktails are pretty amazing.  sooo yummy.  we would go back, but probably order different things.
2;"Well can't say it was a \""wow\"" experience - sadly.  As local stay-cation guests at the hotel we arrived for our reservation on time to find that we had to wait 15 minutes for a table when in fact the restaurant wasn't busy.  We got seated outdoors - absolutely beautiful and a romantic ambiance for sure!  We ordered the cheese/meat platter for an appetizer to start - it was very good.  We waited a long time between each portion of the dinner to be served; too long as I lost my hunger and desire to eat by the time our entres arrived.  The salad was basic - apples walnuts and greens; nothing special.  My husband ordered the scallop dinner and I the duck.  The scallops were fair, they were barely warm and gritty which was a disappointment.  The short rib ravioli that accompanied the scallops were dry and not very tasty.  My duck was overcooked which I could deal with however the cabbage that it was served with was not a delight - there was raw garlic shavings mixed in and added quite the bite of flavor in not a pleasant way.  We did enjoy the homemade chocolate ice cream for dessert.  \n\nOverall, the ambiance was wonderful but the food and timing of courses has a long way to go to compete with other fine and delicious local restaurants close by!  The price of the food was expensive based on the quality served."
2;"It's pretty cheap (we paid about $25 for 2 orders veggie tempura, 2 avocado, 1 cucumber, 1 sweet potato, and 1 vegetable roll and were totally stuffed when we were through), but it looks like their specials seem to be where the best deal is at; quality is so-so, nothing to write home about. The place would definitely benefit from some minor renovation...it has this almost kind of like \""Panda Express\"" feel to it. I dunno, not a fan of that aspect considering it's a one-of-one as far as I know. It is what it is, but it could be nicer, hip-er even, with not a lot of effort.\n\nP.S. This is where I made my discovery that (since they are super stingy with the sweet sauce) mixing Sriracha with soy sauce is a pretty dang delicious dipping sauce for tempura. I did appreciate that they had a big bottle of hot sauce on every table."
1;fried chips for bfast? not cool.
1;I had great expectations that were sadly not met. For the price of the room, I was expecting a LOT more for my buck, maybe I was just too optimistic. I will say the whole hotel was clean and didn't have any unsanitary conditions. But it just seemed outdate for the top price paid, it could use a spruce up. Our room was ready before posted check-in time and when we got to the room there were no problems. The wi-fi was free and the tv channel selections were pretty good. I would say this is an average hotel for amenities with a high price tag.\n Usually when you pay top tier rates, I usually expect the service staff to be very friendly, didn't get that here, I think I had one of the service staff actually talk to me unsolicited. I would not revisit The Westin Convention Center.\n My wife would probably give it 4 star just for the shower head, it was pretty amazing, but when that is the highlight, I don't think there is value here.
1;Could this place be even slower? There's often a line when we've gone, with only one or two people working.  We go so rarely that I don't even think about the line until I open the door and have to stop short. \n\nOther than long lines, they seem to be well-equipped, and some of the staff are quite. nice.
1;Had the loco moco breakfast... it was extremely dry, I have no idea why they serve an item that don't they taste test. The burger from here should be the best part but if was far from enjoyable. Please discontinue from the menu unless you can fix this problem. \n\nReason for 2 stars is the waitress was extremely attentive while I enjoyed watching a game at the bar during Football Sunday
1;Worst $12 chicken sandwich. EVER.\n\nI'd give them one star, but I feel like I need to throw in one more, just because the decor was beautiful, and the weather was great on the patio. They caught me in a good mood.\n\nWe accidentally wandered in during brunch. We had already eaten breakfast, so we were in a tough spot. However, the waitron was kind enough to offer up some lunch menus. Good on her. \n\nIt was also nice of her to bring the flavored syrup for my soda separately. Now if only she'd brought the check in a timely manner when we were done.\n\nI ended up ordering something off the brunch menu anyway -- a grilled chicken sandwich. Supposedly, it's topped with brie and arugula, dressed in a bacon dressing, and served on brioche. \n\nSomeone must've forgotten to place their Sysco order. Because, my sandwich was topped with cream cheese with some brie rind mixed in, and spinach. There were some cold pieces of bacon fat in there, that may indicate some sort of dressing.\n\nThe chicken itself was moist, but completely flavorless.The brioche had potential, but somehow it got soggy and gross.\n\nBleagh. I hate to say it, but I could have gotten a better chicken sandwich at Applebee's for $7.95.
3;I went when I was in Vegas and I was not disappointed
2;"I went to this restaurant with my sister and mother for my sisters belated birthday lunch. The staff were pretty friendly, the decor was a bit depressing though. We livened things up with our cheery presence of course. ;-)\n \nThe food was okay, but portions were a bit small. After reading the menu I thought they were pretty reasonably priced, until I realised just how much (little) food you get.\n\nThe chowder and pan seared sea bass were ok, had to add some seasoning to the chowder though. The chips were amazing! Perfectly crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. I could have happily and easily eaten just those. In fact, the chips and the dessert were the best part. \n\nI was annoyed at one point to see other customers eating fish and chips. The annoyance was because it wasn't on the menu, and if I had known we could have ordered fish and chips, I would have! \n\nI had a gingerbread pudding with a toffee sauce and Bramley apple sorbet for dessert which was out of this world! I could have eaten several of those. hehe\n\nI almost had a heart attack when the bill came. Almost \u00a3100 for 3 people? \nWe had bread and butter, 3 mains and 3 desserts with an extra order of chips and a bowl of chowder. Apparently the Prosecco was \u00a327! If I had known I would have chosen to stop drinking on another day! \n\nSo our experience was okay. The only memorable part of the meal were the chips and the dessert, which is also the only reason I'd ever go back."
4;Thai Patio is excellent!  I often order the Pad Gra Pow (lunch special #6) and it is always delicious.  You can decide how spicy you want your dish to be, from mild all the way up to Extra Spicy!  For $6.95, you get a delicious Thai dish + Soup or salad + an egg roll.  What a deal!  The drunken noodles are also a favorite.\n\nTry this place, you will be happy you did.
4;I love this bookstore.  When i move i will be very sad to leave and not have one of these around.  They carry used books and new books.  You can trade or sell.  They have a very cute area for kids to read books and play.  Every week they have events and book groups that get together and family events on the weekends.  We have seen Clifford the Big Red Dog, and the Grinch.  Every Thursday they have story time for kids at 10am.  You can order books online and have them ready for you there.  i have no complaints about this bookstore.  They are also attached the Wildflower Bread Company which has awesome food.
4;The staff is very friendly...

3;"[I wrote this review under \""Cakes n Flakes\"" -- I dunno why yelp couldn't just change the name of the establish., instead of creating a whole new, empty entry]\n\nAfter a brief closing for renovation, and a change in management, the caf\u00e9 formerly known as \""Cakes N Flakes\""  has now re-opened as \""Curry n Cake\"".  There's still a refrigerated case; the samosas are gone, but cakes are still there (a few whole ones, and about 10 flavors by the slice: black forest, pineapple, pistachio, mango, etc).  \n\nThe clientele looked the same as before, Indians in their +/- 30s (I was the only anglo in the place).  The door still says panini and wraps, but the menu doesn't have those, sticking with Indian foods like dosa, uttapam, and curries.  Today (a Saturday), veg. and non-veg. lunch specials were posted on the counter; I had the veg. for $6.99, which came with bowls of lentils and eggplant, rice, thin bread (rota), and crispy fritters -- very yummy.  I got a piece of butterscotch cake to go (I'm eating it right now; also yummy)."
3;Tip Top Food.\nTip Top Drink.\nTip Top Tavern! \n\nWhile the cash only thing is sort of a drag, their beer line-up is not. Easily one of the best pumpkin beers I've had, spicy, with notes of nutmeg and cinnamon, not sweet. I'll head back and grab the name then update this, as it escapes me. \n\nThe build your own burger is super solid, a la Five Guys in that it's one set price and you can add a bajillion toppings. Premium items like avocado are a little extra, but totally worth it when you consider the burger itself loaded with standards comes in at around 8 bucks. \n\nI agree with a few others who say the noise level can be hard to tolerate, but two people sitting at the bar or a table will be a-ok. Perhaps a larger group might have trouble hearing each other, but the space is quaint and intimate, I'm not sure you'd want to give it a go if your party is larger than 4.
2;The fresh made pasta is delicate and delicious, but flavors and sauces are bland. Better for brunch than dinner, even though I love pasta. Even the bread basket was boring at dinner.
3;Great breakfast joint!  I've eaten there twice and have recommended it to a few friends, and all have loved it.  The Hopple Popple is my favorite, and the portions are huge!  Not the greasy spoon that you often see when dining out for breakfast.
3;I ordered the combo plate (with catfish, fried shrimp, fries, and coleslaw) and mac & cheese. Delivery was fast, like 20 minutes to Squirrel Hill, and everything arrived hot.\n\nThe shrimp and catfish arrived on top of a couple slices of white bread, which I guess was there to keep everything from getting soggy in transit. Well spiced, surprisingly good for delivery seafood. The huge serving of fries reminded me of the awesome cafeteria fries from my high school. The macaroni was something like what you'd find at a buffet - bland, soft, but it hit the spot. \n\nWould have liked to see: cocktail sauce, tartar sauce, maybe buttered or garlic toast instead of cheap white bread\n\nWarning: I'm relatively sure they use MSG. Tastes awesome, but some people are sensitive to it.
3;The Strip is overpriced no matter where you go, so don't let that be your top decision factor.  This place isn't too insultingly expensive anyway, relatively speaking. \n\nThe food quality is most important and I was not disappointed. From the seafood to the landfood, everything was very fresh at Kumi. Nothing negative to say about any of the items served to our table. Yummy! \n\nThe service could use some polishing. The staff was a bit awkward and couldn't figure out a natural timing to things like when to bring/take plates. They were quick and polite but not engaging.
1;The food was good but I had to wait just shy of 2 hrs for it. When I called after 50 minutes of waiting they said the driver left 15 minutes prior to my call. I then waited another hour and called again. They then said they didn't know what was taking so long and that the driver really did leave that long ago. Low and behold my food was still warm 10 min after that second call.. Must have the heat on high in that car.. Not ordering from them again
3;Omg had so much fun...i think. I volunteered since me and my boyfriend were both skeptics about hypnotism we both decided i should be the one up there. We bought the dvd since i cant really recall the events but i did know what i was doing sorta. After the dvd purchase Kevin the hypnotist came by and signed the dvd.\n\nGreat guy n fun show.....i think.  After the show i got approached by some audience members saying how i was really good n funny. After watching myself on dvd i cant stop laughing. Im pretty hilarious n entertaining apparently under hypnosis. Show worth watching if your in town. \n\nDisclaimer: not for people easily offended n shy.
0;"I can't find a single good thing about the this establishment or their so-called \""pizza\""... First, the website did not work and after wasting too much time there and finally calling, they would not honor the prices quoted on the website. Second, the prices were way too much to begin with, nevermind when you call. Third, the pizza arrived very late and I was starving so I begrudgingly accepted... And regretted it. Fourth, it tasted like a foot wrapped in a cardboard. I'm no pizza snob, and I hate this place and the pizza. Do yourself a favor and eat the drywall instead."
2;The rooms are old and the place is a bit out of the way. Their casino doesn't get very busy. The only really redeeming factors were the sports book and the 24 hour diner that served some pretty good food. Maybe with the new ownership things will improve.
2;If by Fremont Street Experience, you mean the campy neon canopy show, eh, it's ok.  The graphics and music are a throwback to what would have been impressive back in the late 90s.  I'm also not a big fan of the street performers honestly, as I don't like being accosted by random people trying to get me to take pictures with them and then trying to charge me for it.  \n\nI've spent a handful of NYEs and St Pat's at FSE, and those have usually proven to be fun.  The pricing for food and drinks is really reasonable, particularly as compared to the Strip.  Given, my times here have always been in groups of friends, and yes, on FSE it is wise to subscribe to safety-in-numbers mentality.\n\nWhat I do appreciate is that FSE is also the Old Strip back when the city wasn't much more than a train-stop, so for surviving the Vegas mentality of destroy-and-rebuild, high-five.
3;"Tired of the Sports Clips or other generic \""barbershops?\"" Then you need to go here.  The barbers here know how to cut hair and keep the place fun and entertaining.  They know how to do shape-ups, fades, and tape-ups. So glad I found this place in Charlotte."
0;I was getting some meat at this store n my 6 year old points out a little bug. I move the bag of chips n there it was a ROACH ALIVE N KICKING! ! Never will set foot in this place again. My real rating is 0 stars!!!!
1;"When the $50 Groupon offer arrived in my inbox, I jumped at the opportunity, as I have had a good experience here in the past.\n\nI made reservations for 8:00 on Friday night under my full name.  Apparently there was another \""Stephanie\"" party, and we were seated at an empty table of 10.  Needless to say, everyone was confused, but the owner came by and straightened everything out.  She was very sweet and accommodating.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of wine and two appetizers: the buratta special which was extraordinary and the stuffed mushrooms which were quite tasty as well.  The timing was a bit off though. We did not get our bread or any of the appetizers for about 30 minutes after the wine came out.  I was starting to get a little dizzy. I recommend the servers bring out the bread at the same time as the drinks. \n\nThe appetizers were the highlight of the evening. For my main dish, I ordered the mugniaia- tilapia saut\u00e9ed with cherry tomatoes, sweet red peppers, capers, Italian olive & Pinot Grigio sauce.  The fish was not bad, but the broccoli it came with was overcooked and honestly reminded me of cafeteria broccoli.  The food was not bad, but for the price, I expected more.  \n\nTiramisu is one of my favorite desserts in the world, so of course we had to order one of those.  I would have rather stopped by Menchie's on the way home for some $4.00 dulce de leche fro yo than eat that. I stopped after two bites.  The lady fingers were very dry and lacking in flavor.\n\nI was pretty bummed as I was so excited to eat here (it was my idea after all).  For Italian, I much prefer Rudy's and Toscana at South Park."
2;Uh I am just gonna give this place an ok review. I am not on yelp to try and  be the next new community manager poster child. I am here to write something honest  in the hopes it helps someone else.\n\nTally-ho....  I ate here with a large group --- we were late trickled in in groups I know this is annoying. But I sat for 40 min without being asked if I needed any water or if I wanted to order.\n\nI got the lamb plate it was not memorable. Flavors are just ok a little bland on the spices for my taste. I would say the same about the hummus. Too chain for me. Then as our check arrived we were told it could only be split 6 ways no matter what. This would have been helpful to know before I ordered. \n\nSo you see this is a gracious 3 Starer. Bon appetit
0;"I have gone to this salon a few times before and had not had such a horrible experience as I did the last time. I went in for a cut and color. My hair was long, almost close to my behind. I had a few layers and asked for the shortest layer to be blended in to the rest of my hair. I didn't want a lot taken off the ends and asked that only about an inch be cut off the ends. They started with the color which was fine at the time, but not true once I got home and looked at it in different lighting. It was blotchy. OK, I could deal with this color....Whatever. But when it came to my cut I think the student had no idea how to layer hair. She left my hair with very short layers that it looked as if I had a very long mullet. Not even the instructor was able to fix this huge mistake. When I heard her tell the student that she had \""cut into it\"", I knew something was wrong. Seriously, all the instructor and the student could say was that they were sorry. Oh yeah, the instructor said that I didn't have to pay for the hair cut. I was so upset with what was done to my hair and the way it looked that I asked them to cut off seven or eight inches so that it could blend in with the rest of my short hair, and look somewhat decent. I can still see the choppyness of my hair and it is still not even half way decent, but after the hair is cut, there is really nothing that can be done.\n\nAfter I got home and really started going through my hair, all I could was cry and scream. \n\nOh one other thing. Because my hair was so long they had to use two extra bowls of color and I was charged for those two bowls, this would not be a problem had I gotten the haircut that I asked for, but being that my hair was so short afterwards and had I gone into the salon with that short of hair I would not have had to have two extra bowls of hair color. I know that these are students and I expect that they will make some mistakes some times but this was HUGE. I don't understand how they could put a student on the floor to work on clients if the student doesn't understand the basic concept of layering. \n\nCurrently, I am waiting very impatiently for my hair to grow back so that I can have someone that knows what they are doing, fix my hair. I say \""IMPATIENTLY', because everytime I do my hair I am reminded of what it used to be compared what it looks like now"
0;Horrible service. Food and drinks were not very good, bland and greasy. Wont be going back!
4;This is performance dessert:  sit at the bar to watch the delicate menu items come to life, the chefs using unusual tools and even tweezers to make sure everything has perfect presentation, then try to have the heart to eat the art. The $20 pre-fixe includes an amuse-bouche palate cleanser, your choice of main dessert, and ends with petit-fours you can customize by flavor and filling.\n\nAmuse was a flavorful pineapple sorbet topped with lychee jelly.\nThe CARIB is visually stunning, served in a wine glass covered with a candy lid that is melted with heated fruit sauce as it is served falling into the glass to mix with the other ingredients prior to eating: fruits, custard, caramelized banana, and mango jelly combine harmoniously.  By far one of the more unique desserts I've tried. \nThe MT. FUJI is a delicate sponge cake with custard, topped with delicate ribbons of coffee-flavored cream and shards of chocolate. This dessert was more in line with what I look for in desserts, and seems to be a safer menu option.\nOther options are the STELLA (strawberry tiramisu), the RED ROCK (raspberry lava cake), and the BATON (pistachio cream in chocolate tube). \nThe PETIT FOURS, similar to profitroles, available in customized flavor fillings and jellies. Raspberry and black currant was a good combination. Presentation even for this simple ending is beautiful, completed by a smear of citrus sauce and two house-made marshmallows.\n\nAll of the desserts look amazing, and with the amount of business they get in the evening you are sure to see them all. Unique place to experience even if you're not a dessert person, definitely a place I'd suggest all locals go at least once for a sweet date night. It's like an intimate, made-to-order version of Extraordinary Desserts (in San Diego).\n\nPS: Don't leave without stopping by the bathroom!
4;Ruth.... You have turned me into a blonde bombshell. There is nothing this lady can't do. I've been coming here since December, and every 8 weeks I am happy as a clam. We've been transitioning me from deep red to blonde (tough challenge), but she goes out on a limb and aces it every time. I've been getting compliments all week! I'm thinking of making my blue-haired sister drive all the way from Flagstaff for Ruth's amazing color correction... I'm sure she could figure something out! lol :) Thank you Ruth! You're amazing!
2;"My girlfriend and I wandered over to this restaurant while waiting for our Blue Man Group show to start and we were not disappointed. The bread sticks were warm and delicious! We started with the fried Calamari, which was fried perfectly leading to a good texture. The dipping sauces were a nice compliment to it as well. My girlfriend got the pasta Alfredo. She said it was very good, although I feel it is hard to screw up an Alfredo sauce. I also got a difficult dish to screw up, chicken parmigiana, it was very good though. I liked how they served the spaghetti that comes with it; the sauce was already on it and it was wrapped up in a ball and served on the plate. I posted a picture of this. I just liked how there wasn't too much sauce served with it, just the right amount. I wouldn't hesitate to go back and try some of their other more complicated dishes."
1;Kind of hidden behind the Treasure Island coffee shop. Very good food. Some of the better Pho we have tried. Not fancy but high quality and great tasting food.......UPDATE 1/27/13.  Returned here to Pho last weekend and must say the quality has gone way down!   Smaller portions, very bland flavor. We will not return. We will venture off the strip to one of the more authentic Pho or Ramen places around Vegas, there are a lot of them.
3;mexican food in phoenix is waaay different than mexican food in los angeles but it was still great!!
1;Not fusion. Not affordable. Not creative.\n\nI could have done better myself for a fraction of the cost with better ambiance in my hotel room at NY-NY.\n\nMediocre service was the icing on the cake. (no water, no silverware... Until the tortilla line cook noticed we were just sitting there debating whether or not to use the dessert spoons left at our place settings -- not too handy for a meal mostly consisting or romaine lettuce.). I'm not Paris Hilton, but paying $50 for less than 750 calories is ridiculous. \n\nOtherwise the food was tasty given that we had no expectations of Jose Andres.
1;This place is filthy. We are sitting in the back at a booth and the space next to the wall is an inch thick in dirt. The place in general in unkempt. \nThe food was fair but 4 rolls and they all tasted the same.
2;Look - 3 stars is A-OK. And that's how their coffee tasted - A-OK. Hard time to rate them though - New Year's Day, leaving town, they didn't get their pastry shipment, so there was very little to choose from and very little atmosphere cuz no one was up yet. But the bottom line is that the cappuccino didn't blow me away - it was fine.\n\nI'd give it another shot next time I'm in town.
3;I love this place! I always make sure to stop in when I go to Vegas.  Cherry Bombs are NO JOKE! Love it!
0;DO NOT GO TO THIS BAKERY!!!  THE STAFF IS VERY UNPROFESSIONAL AND RUDE.  My father who is legally blind with diabetes went in and asked if he could possibly put in a special order for canolis made with splenda and then the staff started cussing and yell at him and told him to go somewhere else.  We will now go to Romanelis in Phoenix!!!  My daddy's bakery needs to be shut down!!!
4;"I have been a customer here for 4 years. It is soo good! I am extremely picky about my hotwings, and this place hits the nail on its head. Crispy, yet juicey; spicy, yet savory! And a dozen wings fries and a large drink for about 7 dollars! I will make the drive for this place anyday:) They have really good hot dogs as well! It may look like a whole in the wall restaurant, but they got their recipes straight"
3;Very very entertaining! I had never seen a Cirque show before and was incredibly impressed with the huge sets and enormously talented cast. Although I am not a huge Elvis fan, I thought it was appropriate to see this show while in Vegas. It chronicled his life through a variety of performances. I was captivated for every moment while watching the show.
2;"The room was clean and comfortable, but not as nice as depicted on their website. The staff was not very accommodating when we requested a room change. They promised to \""take care of it\"" but never bothered to do so after calling the front desk on two different occasions. \n\nAlso, it was pretty difficult to get a taxi. The front desk assured me that it would take five minutes, but none arrived after 15. The walk is not too far from the strip (about 4 blocks), but it was very difficult to get a taxi when you needed one. \n\nOverall, the hotel was pretty good for the price, but the service could definitely use an improvement."
2;This place was ok I'm my opinion. We had to wait an hour to be seated then had to wait about another hour for our food to come out. I ordered the waffles and it was a good size, not sure i would split it since i don't think it was as much, however my hubs ordered something different and his plate was huge  it could easily feed to adults. Overall i recommend eating there at least once.
3;This is really the only Arcadia area car wash.  They do a great job.  It does take a little longer than the average car wash, but that is because it is all by hand and they do a great job of drying and taking immaculate care of your vehicle.
4;I just happened to come across Ice Pan while wandering around Harrah's  one night.  This is definately a hidden jewel within everything the Vegas strip has to offer.   At first I almost passed it up due to steep starting price of around $6 for a cup of ice cream, but it is worth every penny.  This was the best ice cream I have had anywhere and I ended up returning 3 times in the next week although I transfered to a different hotel.  Customers can choose from a variety of flavors and ingredients to add in and every order is made from scratch with fresh ingredients right in front of your eyes.  Because fresh ingredients are used and customers have their choice of ingredients and type of milk, Ice Pan's ice cream is relatively more nutritious than other ice cream options at only 200 calories a cup.  After 2 minutes of watching your creation come together, the result is a delicous creamy ice cream with the perfect blend of flavor and refreshment.  \n\nNot only does Ice Pan offer great ice cream, but a fun and unique experience.  The two guys who were working here were extremely friendly, energetic, and made sure customers had fun creating their ice cream.  They even remembered me when I returned two days later!  Since Ice Pan is tucked away in a hidden location that one will probably only find if they are going to the Harrah's Las Vegas monorail stop, there was never a long wait.       \n\nThis is the only location of Ice Pan in the United States and will definately be a must on all future trips to Vegas!
4;So i moved over to this side of town and while i was unpacking I wanted to get something to eat.  I saw this place in the shopping center and I was in a mood for a hotdog.  Man they are fantastic.  I would go back just for that.  As well as the customer service was top notch.  The cashier there was very helpful and ncie to me on my first time.  I went back recently for dinner with a friend.  We had a deep dish pizza a salad and some cannolis for dessert.  Oh man nothing short of amazing.  Everything was prepared nicely.  We brought it back to my place and everything was till hot and tasty.  I can not praise this place more.  If you are into deep dish pizza please go to this place, it is fantastic.
4;Another Vegas trip. Another round of Fat Tuesdays! It never seems to get old! :D\n\nThis time... I believe I shared two or three with one other person.  I was drunk as hell (according to my text messages sent & twitter updates. -__-)\n\nAgain,  190 octane plus an extra shot of everclear for only a dollar more?! This ish IS the BIZNAZZ!\n\nI don't remember much other than winning hella, then losing it all and most importantly, having a BLAST in Sin City. :]
4;I love this Rock Bottom location, especially eating out on the patio during the cooler spring and fall months.  I'm shocked that they've closed.  What a bummer!
2;Proximity to Target = win.\n\nOtherwise this is your standard Wendy's.  Quick fast food service.  I always order off of the value menu.  Jr. Bacon cheeseburger, value fries, and depending on how hot it is outside a value Frosty or a value pop.  Oh!  They carry PEPSI products, not coke products here.  Blew my mind right out the window.
4;I was a little worried because of all of the negative reviews I saw on here, but you do learn a lot from all the negative reviews. Generally speaking, I get to learn at least the food items offered.\n\nWe arrived at 3:30 right at the transition from brunch/lunch to dinner.\n\nAll food was fresh and tasty. Nothing was really left untouched.\n\nSushi rolls were good for buffet\n\nSmoked salmon was nice, plentiful, and just right temperature\n\nShrimp of course was yummy and not fishy\n\nThe cooked fish (both lunch and dinner varieties were delectable \n\nThe desserts were plentiful in variety and small enough that allows you to try without looking like a glutton.\n\nI'm glad this was my first Vegas buffet experience, because my second trip to a different buffet with much better yelp ratings was horrible, more expensive, and just really truly the pits!!\n\nGood one, hats off to the grand buffet.
0;"Service was poor, and all orders came out wrong..I can deal with that but the menu is selection is small, they only provide a few items and \""was out of chicken\"" really you serve 6 items and can't even keep enough on hand?"
0;Apr\u00e8s plus de deux heures d'attente nous avons finalement eu nos plats! Des plats sans go\u00fbts et froid. Nous sommes huit dans une petite salle qui en contient plus de cinquante places et certaines tables se sont vid\u00e9es sans avoir re\u00e7u leurs plats. Des clients sont partis sans payer et nous allons demander la m\u00e8ne chose. Bref Giorgio a eu de meilleures ann\u00e9es et ils devraient revoir leur concept parce que \u00e7a fait vraiment piti\u00e9!! Un local sera probablement en location bient\u00f4t si des changements ne sont pas effectu\u00e9s rapidement. Aucune \u00e9toile pour ce restaurant...
3;"This show was very good.  I was super excited to attend the show given all of the 5-star reviews.  while it is definitely good and I recommend it, I gave it 4 stars as it is more of a dance type show and less Cirque even more so then Love at Mirage.  I have to say I LOVE Love at Mirage.  We have seen that show 5+ times.  While this show was quite good, I feel like they used several songs that were not part of the mainstream catalog.  That said there were several gems during the show including dirty diana, smooth criminal, billy jean, and several other numbers.  If you like Michael Jackson's catalog as I do and you don't mind that there is a bit less Cirque then I would say 5-stars all the way.  it is very well done.  But if you are expecting a lot of acrobatics or you want more of that I would recommend another Cirque show.  I think Love at Mirage is a better blend of Cirque and music.  \n\nOne other thing to note. I grew up in the late 80's and 90's and I have to say looking back on this era through the music and the videos shown I realized I didn't really like that time very much.  Perhaps \""reliving\"" this is what caused me to feel a bit meh about the show (in all fairness).  Whereas with Love I never lived through that time and it was more interesting.  I felt like I was watching a bit of a retrospective that I didn't really enjoy.\n\nLastly, if you have sensitive ears bring ear plugs this show is LOUD.  I know it is meant to be but I have sensitive ears and my ears hurt afterward as I forgot ear plugs. Trust me even with ear plugs in you will hear everything quite well.  \n\nOverall a great production, excellent visuals and definitely recommend but just know what you are getting and know that it is less Cirque acrobatics."
2;Food was good, service was excellent, but dinner (and especially drinks) were pricy
0;I had a horrible experience with towing. I called and told them my car needed to be towed because it was dripping gasoline. When the tow truck arrived the driver said he could not tow my car because it was dripping gasoline. They then told me I needed to have it cleared by the fire department before they could tow it. I called the fire department and they said they don't provide that service. It would've been nice if AAA had told me they couldn't tow it in the first place before I wasted my day waiting for them. A different towing company towed it without problem. AAA towing was a waste of money for me.
1;There is a reason why when I lived in Scottsdale for 3 1/2 years I never ate at Kyoto. But upon my last visit I decided I should try a new place.\nHmmmm.... I now have also learned to ALWAYS trust my trusty yelper's reviews. \nThis was a bad choice on my part. Bad, slow service. Poor sushi selection. No wine menu. \nThe sushi came out cut as thick as a piece of steak. I hate thickly cut sushi. Rolls.....bland. Ambiance was that of a cheap, generic restaurant. \nThe good.....cheap, sushi was fresh and didn't taste bad.\nBut with all that being said I'll pass on a next time here.
4;The service level of Nordstrom's never ceases to amaze me. On a recent visit to ladies clothes I found a really cute dress that I didn't notice until I got home had a flaw in it- brought it back...the Assistant Manager, Alex Bixler was nothing short of amazing.  She called 7 different stores while I waited to find one that was not flawed.  I would highly recommend this person to assist anyone looking for clothes.  I heard her helping others too.  She is professional, knows the lines and is honest.  I will be making sure I shop when she works and would recommend her for anyone looking for someone to assist them to ask for Alex.
4;Best sandwiches in Las Vegas! Awesome choices and completely customizable. Don't forget an order of fresh cut potato chips or fries seasoned to your liking. Top it off with a perfect dill pickle... Heaven!
2;I wish I could have tried a pancake. . . I came here the morning/afternoon of the Las Vegas Rock and Roll Marathon on 12/04/2011. I ate smart with a healthy breakfast of protein and some toast for carbs. It was good and I was satisfied but I really wanted a pancake. My fiance got chicken and waffles which looked very good and I would have loved a bite but before I knew it his plate was empty and I wasn't offered any. It must have been a good meal.
4;I LOVE a good sandwich.  I'm usually not a big raver of lunch places...because honestly...eh, it's lunch.  \n\nYet Newk's impresses me every single time I go.  It's one of those places that's great for office lunches and Saturday morning hangovers..  Everything I've had from there is absolutely delicious.\n\nNow that I've gotten my rave out I'll go into the details.  I've had a variety of the soups Newk's offers and will say that both the crab soup and chicken chili are to die for.  The crab is perfectly seasoned and just a little spicey.  It's very rich so I recommend ordering a salad for the perfect lunch combo.  The chicken chili is hearty and full of flavor.  I pair that with the steak sandwich and it is by far one of my favorite lunches you can order in the city.  \n\nNow, to get to the sandwiches.  Anyone who is anyone knows the key to a great sandwich is in the bread.  Newk's knocks it out of the park each and every time.  There is something about a warm, soft roll that makes any sandwich absolutely delicious.  You could put a flip flop between that roll and I would probably eat it. \n\nThe steak sandwich is the best I've had in Charlotte.  Which is saying a lot, as I consider myself a sandwich connoisseur.  Again, the bread is just perfect.  The steak they use on the sandwich is cooked very well, not too stringy or tough without being rare.  The onions are sweet and that horseradish mayo I would most likely bathe in.  \n\nIf you need to impress someone over a casual lunch or simply want to put something in your mouth that is absurdly delicious, Newk's is your best bet.
2;I went here Wednesday night to celebrate my birthday with my mom. I had been here before, I went here with my whole family about 5-6 years ago, and, though the food was good, we were a bit upset that they charged us per slice of cake we cut from a cake that we brought....pretty not cool. Anyway, I don't know if they do that anymore, but it was really not cool. So back to the present, the restaurant is very cute and our table faced some bay windows that was pretty nice. Our waiter was a bit snippy at first, for example, my mom asked for bread while we were deciding what we wanted and he said 'I'll bring bread AFTER you order'...how weird is that? It's not like we set this whole fake birthday dinner (with reservations) to smuggle some free bread....Anyway, we ordered and he brought some bread that was warm and tasty, with a crunchy crust and a soft middle. We started with a salad that was fresh and light. I ordered the gnocchi in the cream sauce and my mom ordered the chicken marsala and we split. They were both delicious! The gnocchi was light and the sauce was flavorful, but it was extremely rich...had to take half home. The chicken marsala had a wonderful sauce...you could really taste the wine in there. My one problem with it is that everything is a la carte, so no pasta or anything to eat with the chicken. Despite that, it was tasty, so I can forgive that I suppose. They brought out a slice of cake for me at the end...not sure what is was...it was almost like a tiramisu but with a rum flavor and white chocolate chips on top....it was really tasty, but I wish they would have brought the dessert tray around so I could have chosen....however, they did give us the cake for free so I really can't complain. \n\nFinal word: I would come back here for the delicious food, but don't expect awesome service. \n\n\nPS one of the waiters reeked of smoke, like so much you could taste it when he walked by....that's not so cool. If people want to smoke, that's their prerogative and I don't care, but maybe smoke in the open air so the smell doesn't stick as much....just a thought.
0;"Disappointing. Against my gut instinct to go the dumpling place next door - I went here with my better half and we left truly disappointed. This place was expensive, and the food was terrible. Most of it didn't taste fresh and had no real flavour. \n\nMiso soup. I took half a spoonful and I stopped. I think that was just liquid salt - it was dark, and truly the saltiest thing other than pure salt that I have ever put in my mouth. Wretched. \n\nThe hand rolls weren't fresh tasting at all, the rice was chewy and probably cooked quite a while prior. The rolls were nice, and not unpleasant, but not memorable in any way. Had a couple of hot items which were also - more \""matter\"" than food. \n\nSashimi was actually pleasant and fresh - but cut into such tiny and uneven portions. Nonetheless was good. Salmon in particular was still nice and fresh. \n\nOverall we felt the cost did not justify the result - and we weren't impressed with an imposed 15% service charge for our party of 2. I did not leave the full 15% service fee (though I paid the whole bill). \n\nThis place was a true waste of a good location - regrettably won't be going back (what with so many other options in the city). \n\nSorry Yamaza, but you lowered the bar..."
0;Well they do deliver to your room!\nThey delivered a greasy sausage pizza with average fatty chicken wings and old fries. Edible though!!   Because it was all $14 I can't complain too much.
4;Overall : \nSolid hotel, good location, great breakfast, decent price.  Nice, salt-water pool!  A lot of other reviews of this place confuse me.  It seems like they are describing a different hotel.  \n\nRoom : \nWe had a king size bed business class room (free upgrade from what we booked).  The room was a good size, two comfortable chairs, nice TV, strong wifi signal.  Smallish shower, but not ludicrously so.  Pretty nice - amazing view over the city\n\nCleanliness : \nI am a clean freak.  I hate staying in hotels and I strip the bed everywhere I go to look for bed bugs.  The highest compliment I can give is that I generally had no complaints.  The furniture was clean (and bug free) the bathrooms were clean, even the pool area was decent.\n\nLocation : \nRight on the line between the Gay Village and Quartier des Spectacles, walking distance to several bars, and directly above the crossing of the orange and green (M1, M2) subway lines.  Can't get any better than that!  We always had places within walkable distance, we didn't have to go outside to get to the subway if we wanted to go further away, and we walked out the front door to see a free CIRCUS happening in the park across the street.  Great location.\n\nService : \nFriendly staff, very helpful.  Cleaning crew was in and out quickly every day, concierge was super helpful, and the staff was always smiling when they greeted us.  The two guys watching the pool clearly didn't care, but otherwise pretty great.\n\nBreakfast :\nNot technically a hotel only service, but included with our room, it was much better than any included hotel breakfast I've ever had.  Lots of fresh fruit, eggs, bacon, sausage, decently good baked goods, several types of cereal, and actually good coffee.  Worth mentioning because it made the stay just a little bit nicer, and gave us a nice kickstart to every morning.\n\nPrice : \nAfter all the taxes, our room ended up being about $250 a night, which was a little more than we expected, but not terrible.  Considering it was booked on 3 days notice, right in the middle of Warped Tour weekend, the Circus festival, and the Montreal Jazz Festival it wasn't a bad price.  With the breakfast and great service, it didn't feel expensive.\n\nOther :\nA few other reviews mentioned the homeless people in the area.  Yes.  Get over it.  There are a ton of parks around, Montreal is a BIG city, and homeless people are a reality.  Nobody was aggressive or crazy towards us, mostly they left us alone.  Even if they didn't, what the heck do you expect a hotel to do about the fact that homeless people exist in their city? Get real.
0;Bought an apple pie and it went moldy in two days. Brie was expensive and the worst tasting I've ever had.
1;Just curious,\n\nWhy would a pizza chaim stop offering parm. cheese?\n\nPizza better some days than others, but would sure be nice if drivers or even store carried parmesan cheese and crushed pepper. Many times drivers do not even have napkins.\n\nI prefer to call papa these days.
2;Wednesday I came here for breakfast. I wanted a small breakfast. All I had was a breakfast croissant, Greek yogurt, and coffee. The breakfast croissant consisted of sausage, egg, and smoked gouda cheese. The breakfast croissant was delicious and filling. The charred sausage, smoked gouda, and toasted croissant  brought a buttery aroma and taste to the breakfast croissant. The Greek yogurt was a cherry Fage Yogurt. The coffee was a nice start to begin the day. Overall a nice small breakfast. The price for breakfast was tad pricy, but you're in Vegas what do you expect. At least I added points to my Total Rewards Card.
1;Fries are good, that's about it.\nPlace is ALWAYS mobbed because it's the only eatery open in a concourse where two (!!!) red eye flights to PHL and Charlotte take off.\n\nFries and a Starbucks.  Yum.
2;This small restaurant specializes in tamales with several varieties available off both the written menu and hand written specials board.  It is primarily a takeout restaurant though there are a few seats available at a counter with less than stable stools and a couple of tables outside on the patio.  We ordered a Mexican Coca Cola and 4 tamales:  (2) green chili with chicken, (1) green chili with cheese and (1) chicken.  These were all pretty good though we felt the masa harina dough was a little heavier than we have experienced on trips to Texas.
4;I will admit, I had low expectations of this place. Monster mini golf owns another location in Bakersfield, that I wasn't impressed with. Yet, this place is AMAZING. \n\nMy friend and I, had a 2 for 1 coupon, and had the locals discount. 10.00 for both of us to mini golf. You walk into a flourescent room, and your glowing. Off to the side is a gift shop. Yet, unlike most places in Vegas, the gift shop is pretty neat. \n\nTheres a DJ, who takes requests for your favorite KISS song, and a gentleman, who challenges you to get a hole in one for a prize. It's a fun, lively atmosphere. Whether or not, your a kiss fan. You will have an enjoyable experience. \n\nThey even make the experience of using the restroom unique, provided in the restroom are sharpies, in which they encourage you to write messages on the wall to KISS. \n\nFun, Inexpensive, and DEFINATLY worth going to.
4;This is my first review on Yelp so here you go...\n\nI love Yasu!!  This is by far the best sushi and authentic japanese restaurant in Phoenix.  I have been there numerous times and it never disappoints.  \n\nYou have to try their Sumibiyaki which are items cooked over Japanese charcoal, last time I was there I had the beef tongue..sounds weird but its so good\n\nNigiri/sashimi are a must.  They always have the best selection and daily special, most important...its always fresh...this is definately important!!  The sweet shrimp is my personal favorite and anything else you order, you will find the fish is sliced with great execution.  \n\nRequest fresh chopped wasabi, you will never eat sushi with out it again!  \n\nLove this place!!
0;WORST PLACE EVER!  Used to be my favorite restaurant when on King St.  New location has made this place go way down hill.  Every  time we have been here the staff was rude and the service was terrible from the host to bar staff to waitstaff.  I get a feeling like they feel they can do anything.  Even though they have the best scallops ever, I will never go there again.  HORRIBLE
2;The food is not bad but I think price is a little hight for downtown. Service is very slow.. And when we arrived they are not busy at all..
1;Underwhelmed. With the modern classic decor and ambiance, you would think the food would be a certain threshold of deliciousness. Sadly, I was greatly disappointed in the pizzas that we ordered. The crust was uninspired and was one of the most disappointing crusts I've had. It just sorta sat there as a vehicle for some sauce. It looked like a thin crust pizza, but  the crust just tasted heavy and lumbering.
1;The pho is okay for a pho place in the casino and you don't want to drive and it opens late\nservice is bad, my old lady wanted pho but they kept messing up the order and people in front of her orders were being messed up, so she passed on it.\nI ate pho here and it was okay.
1;"Golden Phoenix Chinese Cuisine\n\nI have recently moved to this area and as a result my wife and I are scoping out the local eateries looking for our new mainstays. Golden Phoenix is very conveniently located for us, but that is about all it is.\n\nLike many quickly opened Asian Cuisine places, this restaurant has absolutely no atmosphere. Aside from a few flat screens and some kitsch Asian lamps there is nothing to distinguish this hole in the wall. Service is cold and the server kept repeating \""relax, take your time\"" which would be fine if not for the fact that I felt she wanted us as window dressing telling the public, \""look, we got some suckers in here, please be a sucker and come in here too.\""\n\n\""We use Vegetable Oil\"" is the quip on their menus. I like the fact that lard and MSG are left out of their food prep, you would think that their cuisine would have a lighter touch, but this is far from true. I ordered the Beef and Broccoli and my wife ordered the Cashew Chicken. The B&B was so heavy that I simply could not eat it. The beef was tender and the broccoli was crisp but it was drowned in a soy sauce so oily and heavy I simply could not eat it. My wife's Cashew Chicken was prepared similarly without a single Cashew in sight, just a thick stomach churning soy sauce.\n\nThe sides were not any better. The noodles were also heavy but better than the main course and likely reheated (which may have been what saved it.) The Fried Rice was also over seasoned and also tasted and felt reheated and again, this actually made it edible since the oil was not as prevalent. I did not even finish my egg roll, nuff said. The only thing that was good was the Egg Drop Soup. The soup had a nice light taste and velvety mouth feel and was a delight. It was too bad the rest of the food lacked the same finesse.\n\nSad to say I will likely not be returning to Golden Phoenix; for me there are only ashes there."
3;The ONLY reason this review is not getting 5 stars is that I had to go to the store due to a phone going bad after 20 days (this after the one before that lasted 41 days.)\n\nI had called the District Manager after having successfully worked with her on the prior phone issue.  She called ahead and told the Manager, Marcus, that I was coming in.  I'm sure she advised him of the prior issues.  Marcus took a LOT of time with me trying to make sure I got what I was looking for (or as close to it as possible since Verizon does not have a current phone to meet my needs.) \n\nThanks to Marcus and Amber for making sure Verizon kept a customer - despite issues with the phone units themselves.
4;"So my first time at Goodtimes Bar & Nightclub was April 2011 it was extremely dead when we first got there at 11ish we had a few coronas and decided to hop somewhere else my friends had been there before and said it was crackin' last time they went so we headed back around 1:30ish and it was packed we were there on a sat./sun. which I believe the theme or whatever was \""Club Papi Chulo\""  the music was most reggaeton, salsa, spanish alt., and a lil hip hop thrown in here and there. Crowd was mostly of course latino y latina I had a good time. I didnt buy any of my drinks there so I couldn't tell you prices, but I can tell you they were good! Good mix of woman and men, Sexy gogo dancers 2 woman and 2 men. Beautiful latina women OMG!  thats just my opinion though haha... I do believe there were a few straight people but not an over powering amount, mostly gay. It only cost $10 when we went. And I would say for that cheap of a cover we had a wonderful time. Def. recommend it to anyone, check this place out on the late night weekends."
3;Super friendly! Went here to buy paint and magnets for my classroom.  There were lots of color options and many different shapes and strengths of magnets.  Also, if you are in the market for some good people watching, this place delivers!
2;"Sis & I wanted to have a nice holiday-time weekend in Vegas - to see all the decorations & more importantly to see BARRY MANILOW\n\nThis was his show's closing weekend so dinner at Eiffel Tower was the perfect place to have a nosh.\n\nBelieve people when they say to dress up!  I'm SO GLAD I didn't wear my jeans - which we do ALL the time in SF.  But not to fret, I still felt their disapproval at my fleece pullover so snooty-rep intact!\n\nSis was also put in her place when she asked for a glass of Pinot & didn't specify Noir.  Gee, I'm sorry but here in Wine Country, Pinot *always* implies Noir\n\nBut fake, facetious \""french\"" snootiness aside, we enjoyed our meal\n\nStarters included the Blue Cheese Souffle & let me just say this place knows how to make one mean souffle!  Light as air & just a hint of blue cheese flavor (could have been a bit more pungent but was still a fan)\n\nEntrees were the one & only veggie dish they offered - the veggie crepe.  Sis loved it but I was completely turned off by the abundance of lemon\n\nWhat did absolutely rock my world however was this Mushroom Spaetzle we got as a sidedish.  I could have had about 2 of these as a main course & been totally satiated.  Earthy, mushroomy, & tender pasta-like spaetzle.....absolutely delish!\n\nDesserts included the Banana Souffle for Sis & Pumpkin Souffle for me.  We each thought ours was the best of the 2 & again, we're greeted w/ the lightest, airiest, souffle w/ just a hint of banana or pumpkin\n\nWas hoping they'd be paired w/ something other than Creme Anglaise - like maybe a caramel pairing for the banana & a chocolate for the pumpkin but the anglaise was still tasty & didn't take away too much from our devouring\n\nPeople all around us were celebrating 1 thing or another - a couple on one side of us was celebrating a birthday & then this other couple was celebrating their very first Mommy-Son date night; and this other couple sitting right beside us got engaged right there while we were having dinner.  So much love & excitement!   \n\nAnd this is all while overlooking the Bellagio Fountains.....would totally come back for the ambiance & maybe dessert!\n\nOverall, food - 3 Stars; staff - 2 Stars; atmosphere - 5 Stars.....averaging = 3 Stars"
0;the worst ! \nhorrible service- not one sile or thank you \nworst fries/onion ever!  it tasted like shit \ndiscusting burger\nexpesive for a burer joint\n..............would never ever go there again.............
0;Don't ever come to Harmon Medical Center with a loved one as they refuse to let you be with them in the exam room.  And, they won't let the patient use their phone. So shady if you ask me. No communication or sharing of information. Even if patient requests it!!
2;Dragon Palace is your stereotypical, neighborhood Chinese restaurant. It's back in the corner of a shady looking strip mall, which doesn't exactly draw you in. The restaurant itself is decorated with rather gaudy, gold and red decorations, complete with red paper lanterns.  Although I don't come here for the atmosphere, I wish one of these days they'd put a sound system in and play some background music. Despite the less-than-elegant decor, this restaurant has a certain charm to it.\n\nI've been coming here with my family for about 20 years and it's still my restaurant of choice for Chinese food. The egg rolls and crab puffs are pretty tasty, but my favorite appetizer is the egg drop soup. It's thick, flavorful and I have yet to find a rival anywhere. Great dishes include the Mongolian beef, cashew chicken and house special chicken. Americans everywhere have their favorite, must order Chinese food dish and I'm willing to bet you'll find a pleasant version of it at Dragon Palace. \n\nThe best time to go is at lunch! It's quick and cheap. Their lunches, which come with a generous helping of your choice of dish (say kung pao chicken), rice, egg roll, 2 wontons and either egg drop or wonton soup are less than $6, most around $5. If you're REALLY on a budget, order a bowl of egg drop soup for only $1. \n\nThe only thing you can't get at lunch time is their after-dinner, Banana Caramel Delights! They drop one off for each person with the check.This isn't the actual name for them, but as they are complimentary and not on the menu, I'm not sure what they are called. They are basically banana filled crispy wonton wrappers that are then coated in a crunchy, sugary, caramel coating. If you like bananas and sweet things, you'll love these! \n\nIf you're craving Chinese food, stop and eat here or pick up a to-go order and eat it in whatever environment you choose!
1;The real test of a coffee house is not how it prepares its specialty drinks...(let's face it, enough sugar and cream can make anything taste good).   No, the real test of a coffee house is how their black, regular drip tastes.    I like it complex, rich, and nutty.     \n\nHow disappointing that Lola's regular drip is weak, watery, and tasteless.     \n\nPastries are great, though.     Ambience is cool...though it's echo-y and a little loud if you want to carry on a conversation.     \n\nStep up the coffee and I'll be back
0;HORRIBLE PLACE TO LIVE!\n\nFIRST OF ALL..... these apartments are NOT IN BALLANTYNE!!!!  This place has changed dramatically since I first moved in. It used to be quiet and peaceful. The genius who decided to design some of the apartments to where their bedroom is literally in the hallway of the building....Smh. I can hear EVERY...SINGLE...CONVERSATION that goes on in the hallway. You complain about noisy neighbors...they won't do anything about them. I have called the police multiple times on neighbors fighting, arguing. I have found a couple of dead roaches. There are spiders everywhere. In the spring, the carpenter bees take over and they claim there is nothing they can do. I had to call numerous times about wasps building nests outside my door and no one responding. The pools.....I'd never go there. Nice looking.....creepy people that watch women swim. Disturbing. I haven't had any major problems with office staff but I feel like they do just enough to not get major complaints.
2;Finally got a chance to hit up North in Arcadia last night. Nice addition to the area, fits right in with all of the other great places in the neighborhood. Met some other couples for drinks and dinner. Like most people who grew up here, obv not a fan of mandatory valet but oh well. Walking in, you're definitely struck by the amazing decor and it's certainly the highlight of this location. Big, open spaces, beautiful Italian farmhouse converted to a restaurant. Really stunning.\n\nSat at the bar for a while, it was packed and service was not as prompt as I'd like which was kind of a running theme for the rest of the night. Not a huge fan of the plaid shirts worn by the servers. They didn't really stand out and were hard to distinguish from the patrons sometimes. Finally, when we were moved to our table we just carried our drinks and a bottle of wine over, which I always think is funny when patrons are walking around a restaurant bottle of wine in hand...\n\nService was ok not great. 4 of the 5 couples in our group had never been to North but we never were given a run down of the restaurant or what is good or any of the normal stuff most servers give you when they first greet you. Never once did our server fill our wine glasses, and they tried to take my wife's dinner plate away before she was finished, and they actually did take mine away without even asking and I wasn't finished. \n\nFood was very good as you'd expect from a Fox restaurant. Had the Seasonal Vegetable Salad w/ chicken and it was great. Love the farro in it. Also had the prosciutto wrapped chicken, was a little disappointed in it. It was good, but I just expected something amazing I guess and it just seemed pretty standard. I didn't at all like the bed of spinach it was served on. It comes served in a large bowl and the bottom of the bowl was filled with the juice from the chicken and the spinach was just kind of wet and soggy. Seemed like a sloppy presentation.\n\nDefinitely would go back. I'm a huge sucker for beautiful spaces and this is one of my favorites in the valley. Everything else was just decent, but that isn't terrible so I'm happy for another good restaurant in the area.
1;All they did was try to up sell me.
3;"This is my favorite weekend breakfast stop. It is local and family owned so the service is a bit quirky and they don't always take your order fast. Or cook it fast sometimes. And there seems to be a little east coast surliness some mornings, which I like.  But to me it is just what Ahwatukee needs, a place to have a coffee/chai, have a conversation with friends or family, read a magazine or fiddle with your iPad, and get a good crepe. \n\nBut if the pace or service bugs you, there is a Cracker Barrel just down the street.  \n\nThe crepes are yummy. Not like ones you get in London or Paris, or even Seattle for that matter. But for suburban Phoenix they are great. My guess is it is the ingredients. Not as fresh maybe?  \n\nThe selection of crepes is good, and they have always accommodated any requests or custom orders.  I've had most of the \""cupz\"" offerings as well and they are all good, hot or cold. My kids like the Italian sodas. \n\nI wish they had a bigger patio with a better view than the parking lot, but it is a strip mall and they do well with what they have. The decor is cute \""Paris\"" without being over the top and they have books and coloring for the kids. They also have a couch area with a TV for any catching critical sporting events that might be on. \n\nThe business level is unpredictable. Light during the week it can be packed on weekend mornings, but is sometimes empty. \n\nI recommend the eggs, ham and cheese for breakfast or the nutella and bananas for sweet crepes. \n\nI kind of wish they were open late. It would be great for coffee and desert crepes."
3;"I want to start by saying that this hotel has really responsive customer service, and impressive service recovery. On checking out, you 're always asked \""How was everything?\"". Typically I say \""Fine\"" and leave it at that. This time I actually told them the truth: the first room I booked into had a failed door lock. The second room, an upgrade - and a very nice upgrade - had a heater that worked, but made awful noises. The hotel sent staff to address both problems right away, and on check out empowered staff to adjust the bill accordingly.\n\nThis is great service from a hotel with a very nice layout, amenities and location. I have used the Hyatt Place brand when traveling for business. This trip was to visit my niece and nephew for Thanksgiving. We reserved two rooms for myself and two adult sons. I received an upgrade after the door lock problem. Beautiful room, really clean, spacious and an awesome view. My sons took an evening walk and found that the location was really ideal. The found an ice skating rink and enjoyed a night skate!!\n\nI'm very impressed with this property, the FREE wi-fi, the complimentary breakfast and the great customer service. I only deducted a star because you clearly should check room heaters when the weather turns, and working locks are integral to feeling secure when staying at any property."
0;I wanted to join the parade of folks who speak out after having set foot  in one of these factories of misery. \n\nFirst, let me get the one, single, solitary nice point out about this place: It has multiple teas on slow brew for you to sample, and they are delicious. There. That's it. \n\nNow, that's how my experience started. Naivety. Free samples. Innocence. Peace and tranquility. Let me tell you a tale, a tale that has no happy ending...\n\nWilly Teawonka, our sales person and bullsh** slinger extraordinaire, kindly introduces himself and proceeds to tell us about their grand selection of fine fine teas, and ohhh we must smell them, yes yes, do smell them my precious guests!! You will be intoxicated with the magical aromas!! \n\nSo Wonka spins and perouettes and grabs canister after canister, popping the tops and fanning tea smells into our faces, oh so delightful! Whif whif, such an orchestra of delightful puffs of air! Yes, honey, let's do this, let's buy some TEA!!! Wonka! I'll take an ounce of this fine tea!!! I must have it!\n\n////////////////screeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeech/////////////////////////\n\nNo, you cannot have ONE OUNCE, but I can sell you pounds and POUNDS of tea, WAHAHAAAA, GLORIOUS tea, and I'll give you ten dollars off if you buy a whole lot of it, and it will be $290 instead of $300, what a wonderful salesperson I am to you!!!!\n\nNo thanks.. we'll just have the ounce of the tea!\n\nOh no no noooooo my pretty pretty little lost children in my mighty tea kingdom!!! You must have a metric ton of tea! Nothing less will do! \n\nNo really... I only want the one ounce please, we must be going now! \n\nOh, alright, but I've never had someone purchase so little tea before!! You must feel like a horrible, horrible person who knows very little about tea! \n\nNo, I'm good, I am happy with my life outside of Teevana, actually. \n\nOk well I went ahead and rang you up for a $60 airtight container! It will keep the wonderful tea oh so fre....\n\nWhat? No! I don't need that! Take that off! What are you doing ringing me up for things I didn't ask for and don't need?\n\nOH YOU DON'T NEED IT? HOW WILL YOU KEEP IT FRESH? YOU KNOW IT NEEDS TO BE AIR TIGHT AND DARK, DON'T YOU!?!?!?!?!? [glaaaaare]\n\nLook man, give me my ounce of tea or we're bouncing up outta here and I'm going to slash your tires, final answer you lunatic. \n\nAnd we bounced, never to return to this dark place of sinister tea wizardry.
4;The tomahawk was worth every penny.  You can tell it was elaborately prepared and cooked to perfection.  The ambience and decor were nice for an off-the-strip steakhouse.
0;Beware of these apartment complex they are the worst of the worst. I lived there for a year a whole year I can't even believe I actually survived and I mean that literally. The only way I survived was practically because I mainly just came home to sleep. So where do we begin? Mmmm... Starting of by appearance the apartments look run down old and there is cockroaches and bed bugs I was constantly having to put heavy chemicals just to keep those nasty bugs away. One day when it rained our 2 bedroom ceiling started leaking I had to put buckets to catch the water and on top of that Managment took 3 weeks to come and actually look at the damaged caused by the rain. Next is couple situations that happend here, I lived on the third floor (the last floor) the very first one at ground level lived a older man that I never got to meet but, basically after complaining for over 2 weeks about little red bugs what looked like fruit flys taking over our apartment, we come to find out this older person was dead for over 3 weeks it was crazy!! Police and what looked like CSI in white zipped up suits were all over that apartment it was scary. Another thing about these apartments are constantly scared for my life situations all from people fighting, shootings, drunk fights, 2 episodes with child protective services taking kids away, home robberies, car theft, possible prostitution (I say possible because there was men coming in and out of this girls apartment but, I didn't actually witness the prostitution happening but seriously what else could it be), and drug dealers! Oh almost forgot one of the apartment caught on fire!! I really can go on and on about these apartments. Don't let the cheap rent convince you! My husband and I were going through a really rough time financially and that's how we ended up here, but I will never ever go back and I for sure DON'T recommend living here you couldn't even pay me!! Staff is very rude and don't care about your safety. If I could I would rate a negative 0 lol! I wish I could tell you everything in detail about this horrible awful place but, it will take too long. When you see these apartment complex run as fast and far as possible and don't look back I'm trying to save your life.
2;I'm with Norma on the to-go option at Sweet Tomatoes.  I stopped by after Yelp Office Hours today and picked up a salad to go.  (I had planned on eating at Pane Bianco but they are closed on Monday - bummer!)  Actually, for $8.22, it was a great deal!  I left with a huge salad, a side of steamed veggies, a cup of soup, a sweet potato, and an apple.  Now that is getting a bang for your buck!\n\nI've also eaten at other locations in the past and left feeling way too full because when you eat there, you have to take advantage of everything including the fro yo, bakery items, and more... \n\nI was impressed that the entire salad bar was kept clean and had many options to choose from.  I noticed for an additional fee, you can also get a side of grilled chicken now.  I didn't need that though with so many other options.  \n\nI will not be a regular at Sweet Tomatoes, anytime soon, but for the right occasion, especially when picking up 'to-go' lunch, it works.  Good thing I didn't read the other reviews on this location before I went, or I probably would've spent double the $$ at AJ's around the corner!
0;"This was an awful experience start to finish. We entered and noticed right away that the place looked rundown - cheap art, bad carpentry, and water damage to the drop ceiling with missing tiles.  We were told to sit anywhere and after a long wait (20+) our waitress stopped to take our order. Requested a beer - the tap was not working which in hindsight was probably a blessing as the best part of the entire meal was the bottle of Carlsberg. \n\nWe ordered  guacamole - and were told they were out of it. After changing our choices, the waitress returned to tell us they are out of the sauce for the spicy shrimp? Not a great start but it gets worse. \n\nThe apps come out and were ok. We then waited over an hour for the entrees while watching surrounding tables be seated AND get their food.  My companion had ordered the mushrooms which came out and were so salty as to be inedible. We told the waitress who merely gave a perfunctory \""sorry\"" and removed the plate. After another 15 minute wait, the remainder of the meal arrived. The lamb was of course well overcooked and the shrimp dish again overly salted. \n\nThe waitress was apologetic and blamed the kitchen. The wait was horrible, the ambiance nonexistant, the prices too high and the quality of the food about what you could expect from your local 7-11. All in all one of the worst dining experiences in Montreal."
4;My boss' favorite Italian restaurant when he travels here. We even had our sales meeting here and were very well treated. We sat at the tables outside and were treated to great wine, fresh tasting food, and delicious salads. \n\nMy only mediocre note was the dessert-but we really didn't have much room anyway!
1;Virtually the same as any other pub/ bar around town. TVs, full kitchen, selection of drinks, games, and etc. Nice service too but my lone problem is the overcharge. \n\nI was billed $18.20 but charged over $21. Sure it's only 3  bucks but I mean come on, fix the register. I really have problems with businesses that do overcharges and they may not mean to do it purposely but if it's a constant issue, they should attend to it. Especially if they don't really pay attention to the details of their finances, they'd overlook the charge and not even notice it. Why should I have to go through calling my bank and filing a claim of an overcharge? \n\nIf you plan on coming here, come with cash. That is all.
2;Since the guys rave about this place for Monday Night Football, it was time for me to go too.  We met two other people fir dinner on a Friday night. The service and getting our food was VERY slow. And the food was just ok.  I had a burger with fries.\nThe place was ok, but certainly not the place to go grab something quick to eat.
3;The Charleston Nike outlet... always busy, a little smaller than the Las Vegas Premium outlets location but good finds nonetheless. I used to find great deals here all the time but my last trips to Vegas havent been so fruitful at this location. It doesn't deter me from always making a stop at this outlet whenever in town. Park in the parking structure cause it's a short walk to Nike. Search the back wall for clearance marked shoes. You might just find a gem in the stacks. Last time I was in town all the shoes on the back wall were an additional 20% off.
0;I don't understand why this place is still open. I ordered the endive salad which had nice toppings but the endive was inedible had had no flavor. Also the salad was huge and endive was 90% it. My friend had a chicken penne pasta that I could have easily made better at home and I am not a good cook. The service was overwhelming at first, we were greeted by three different people, then half way through our meal it was nonexistent. We watched a busser service all the tables around us while our server had disappeared. Even a man who appeared to be a manager/ owner cleared the empty plates from the diners next to us, offered them dessert and coffee and delivered their dessert. Meanwhile, my guest and I seemed to be completely invisible. I assume this is because we both had most of our food still on our plates and no one wanted to ask why we hadn't eaten it. Still no server around, the busser finally comes and asked if we are finished, we say yes and he takes our mostly full plates without concern if we enjoyed it. I didn't volunteer any info since the service was so bad I wouldn't go back even if I liked the food. I work in a restaurant so I know the difference between a server who is swamped and a lack of interest.
0;Mediocre food at best when we went last week. Don't let the Italian name fool you. Very limited Italian menu and when I asked for grated cheese ony angel hair pasta, the waitress looked surprised, went and checked and of course they don't have any. Why would they??? Lame and the wine isn't all that much of a value either.  Better places abound...try anything else.
3;After a successful visit to Smoke Taqueria (directly across the street), we felt compelled to give Homestead another shot and visited Tin Front Cafe on 8th Ave in the heart of Homestead.\n\nFirst impressions are important and Tin Front succeeded in providing a welcoming, bright, and fresh ambiance.  Very cool to see that the pieces of tin (from the roof) were repurposed to cover the front of bar and also doubled as eclectic wall sconces too!\n\nWe were seated shortly after walking in and presented with their lunch menu.  We sat near the kitchen service window and were fortunate enough to see many of the listings before ordering.\n\nIt was a cold day and the vegetarian chili sounded like a great way to start.  Even though it took a little longer than expected to come out of the kitchen, I'd say it was worth the wait!   A steaming bowl of hearty chili, loaded with veggies, topped with cheddar cheese, and a single slice of soft fresh bread.  (Might suggest Tin serve with a second piece of bread, considering the portion size). I would have been content with just this!\n\nOnto the main event - we both ordered the grilled portobello sandwich.  The sandwich is served with a generous side of mixed greens and (what tastes to be) homemade dressing - very tasty!  The bread was toasted to perfection with just enough char for additional flavor.\n\nAll-in-all, a great venue and good value.  We'll plan to return, as there were other menu items that looked great!  AND they have a small outdoor patio and happy hour 5-7pm everyday ...  is it spring yet!?!
4;Lucy is amazing, she come on time on my daughter birthday on june 14. She get involve directly with the kids n paint amazing character, she paint fast n the result very good.
0;This place was horrid. My husband and I got a deal to stay here back in April 2012 for our anniversary. (it was also our 1st night ways since the birth of our daughter) It was in a good area surrounded by nice resorts. The pictures on their web site were misleading and not at all what the rooms or grounds were actually.  After arriving we found our room at the very back of the grounds which was a plus with the privacy. The hammocks were nice and relaxing. The room it's self was large but stuffy and dusty. There was dirt and cob webs on the walls. It was definitely uncomfortable. The beds even seemed dirty and thry were very uncomfortable. We decided to go to the pool to get a couple drinks and enjoy the sun. It was getting late so we were limited on time for sun. I choose the only area where the sun was still shining while my husband stood at the bar waiting on a staff member to assist him. After about 10min he gave up 5 min later a staff member appeared however did not serve us, or acknolwde we were there. Instead he began straitening pool chairs and then told us we would have to move our chairs to one of the shadier spots. I was confused by this however the staff member made it clear it's not his problem. The staff was not hospitable. I was appalled. We left and got ready to go out to a nice bar in the area to get drinks and appetizers as they do not have an active bar/resturant on the grounds. we also dropped our car off and tried to use their service that will take you to your destination however after waiting 45min wait we just called a cab. (this was a weekday, not even a weekend) the staff didn't apologize or give any explanation. This was a disappointing night out (we left early as it was not worth another night)
0;Annoyingly slow!!!!  Takes an hour to get a car wash.  Not acceptable. People have jobs and lives Danny's but then again it is apparent lately by your quality and your staffing that you have give up!
3;"I'm fi'in to be back soon.  Oh yea.\n\nIt won't matter what you get it on, as long as you get the breading.  \n\nThe breading.   !!    Somehow this stuff defies the laws of physics and packs more good stuff into its thin, crispy layers than should be able to fit.  !!\n\nI had a Pork Chop Sandwhich with fries for $6.50, and the chop was HEE-UGE.  You can get catfish, chicken, whatever.  Get something breaded.   (!!)  I'm sure the ribs are great, but they don't have them breaded, so forget it.  (Just kidding - I wanted ribs, but they weren't ready yet. \""He won't serve them until they're tender enough,\"" said the server, of the chef.)\n\nI also overheard a neat conversation about how they wanted to be sure to be able to advertise \""GREEN\"", and that, among other things to that effect, all of the interior decorating -- chairs, tables, wainscotting, etc -- was recycled.   Fabulous.  Do they come breaded?"
3;I just happened to stumble to 2 sisters as I was getting my coffee  and bagel next door. I walked in and was instantly greeted by a receptionist and told her I want a facial. She booked me for the next day. The day of my appt I'm greeted by all the staff, mind you I'm the first one there. Everything its clean and soo cute...makes you want to buy a new outfit. Courtney tells me she will be doing my facial. I'm super nervous because I haven't had a facial in years and embarrasses with my lack of up keeping on my skin. courtney was so sweet and understanding..so down to earth. She did an awesome job. My skin was so soft and renewed and she didn't butcher my eyebrows and didn't try to sell me anything, in fact she gave me suggestions on some products and make up. As I am also new to scottsdale, she gave me names for hair and child care. I'm totally going back! \n\nNice bonus is the parrafin hand wax...I wasn't expecting that.
1;"Ate dinner here for the first time a couple of days ago. Combo dinner w/ green chilli.  No draft mex beers. \n\nOK food just not the kind of Mexican food I like. I like my corn chips covered with salt, hot and greasy, like they just came out of a boiling vat of lard. Theirs were the kind of generic chips you can get anywhere.  Rest of the food was average.\n\nI lucked out and got a very good waitress who checked on my table often. \n\nThe atmosphere was kinda of weird. The painted celling made me think of Aphrodite's palace in \""my big fat Greek wedding\"". \n\nAnyway they got really busy about the time I was leaving so they are doing something right. Just not a place I will make a regular stop."
4;Loved it!\n\nI know NOTHING about go karting, cars, engines but my boyfriend who loves stuff like that brought me here for date night. We came around 10:45pm on Friday night. They had a running special so the boyfriend paid full price and my cost of entry was only $5. The workers were EXTREMELY helpful. Since we came so late, we were the only people there (excluding the group at the food area) so we had the track for ourselves. \n\nOne thing I really like is that you sign up and register upon entry and they automatically send you your race times and place number to your email along with giving you a print out. \n\nI had the best date night ever coming here.
0;We ordered 2 couches from Lazy Boy and I am very unhappy with the quality of the upholstery.  Esp on the arms.  I have never seen arms with puckers in them before in my 50+ years.  I even had Lazy Boy out to look at them and the tech said that is the way they work and that I should push the fabric to take out the lumps.  I can tell with my untrained eye, too much fabric was installed.\n\nThe couch that faces out, also has spots underneath where the webbing is lose and can be visible.\n\nI will never order anything from Lazy Boy again.
0;Don't rent from Dakota / Mark Taylor co.\nThe pool and the area around it are dirty, bathrooms next to pool are rarely clean\ncross your fingers when requesting maintenance, 50/50 chance it will be fixed on first visit. ac units are old suck electricity big time. windows are all single pane cheap crap.\nstove and fridge are probably 15 years old . washer / dryer routinely break down then in maybe 3 days if your lucky you will get a used one as a replacement that might last a few weeks if your lucky. repeat maintenance call omg.. There is better places out there keep looking.
4;I go here all the time I absolutely love it everything on the menu is fantastic such a funky vibe, rustic, great coffee bar in the back. The bathrooms are my favorite part I know that sounds weird but each one is different, different music, different vibe different theme so creative
1;What do you call an elephant with glass slippers?  Cinderelephant.\n\nThis elephant walks into a bar...\n\nHad enough?\n\nMe to.  I probably won't be back to Elephant Bar.  My food wasn't bad.  It was just mediocre and overcooked.  For the money I could go so many other places.\n\nThe atmosphere tries to be interesting and jungley-wungley with animal patterns all over the place.  It struck me as a buffet in Vegas.  I'm not quite sure why but that was the overall impression and it hit me quick.  Not one of the good buffets either.  A buffet overcrowed with blue hairs and sweaty tourists, a loud and bustling buffet with high prices and mediocre food.\n\nTo their credit (I think) the desserts we split were huge.  I would call them family style.  1 dessert could easily have served 4 people.
2;I love this boutique. This is my one-stop shop for Longchamp bags - and we all know how much I love my Longchamps. (: I've also had a great time perusing all the clothing and accessories that they carry. Definitely a little out of my price range for now, but this is the one place in Madison where I can go once in a while to treat myself to something nice. (:\n\nHowever, I definitely agree with Sarah M. about the attitude of the employees. The few times that I've been in the store, I've gotten the feeling that I'm not taken very seriously because of my age. I've taken my friend shopping there a few times as well, and she's gotten the same vibe too. Otherwise, Karen&co is great, and this doesn't bother me enough to stop me from returning!
3;I would give them 5 stars if they had better chips BUT their food is great them accommodate our vegetarian needs. The place is clean. I have dined in both the bar and restaurant area and both rock. The ElPatron is SO GREAT!
3;Ah Drai's...Think of it as if the club you're at is not happening and you still need to get your party on, this might be the place for you.  Best to arrive after 2am, that's when the other clubbers start coming in.  Service is good and multiple dance rooms, so the choice is your's.
3;Tasty bowls of delights!\n\nBut I have to agree with an earlier comment that the prices ARE a bit high. On the plus side, though, they do offer free birthday bowls which I took advantage of. Today is my birthday so we didn't have to pay for a Regular bowl which is normally priced at $11.49.\n\nHubby chose a Large bowl which was $14.49. Prices are subject to tax, of course. If not for the birthday discount, the price would have been $25.98 plus tax. Since the bowls are rather on the small side, I would have to agree with reviewer Chris V. who posted about 5 months ago.\n\nThe other Mongolian grill we've been to was in Utah and we don't remember paying as much -- even with paying for 2 bowls -- and they were good too, taste-wise.\n\nGenghis Grill has a self-serve soda service which is separate from the bowl price.\n\nAll in all, we had a delicious and filling meal which rounded the day off to a beautiful ending.
0;"DO NOT STAY HERE!!!! This place is horrendous ! Dirty carpets, dirty torn curtains, non-functioning outlets, freezing/scalding showers,wrinkled sheets, sandpaper \""bath towels \"" the size of dish towels , crumbling faux leather desk chair and disgusting comforters and 30 year old blankets. Oh yeah, ice machine broken, no elevator. And yeah , the sports bar/ horse racing den...uber scary!\n\nOmg wouldn't have stayed here except it was spring training and we booked too late.\n\nNever again Ramada, stick with Best Western!"
0;"Total incompetence.  I called Christmas Eve morning to see what time they would close today.  The old lady on the phone said \""4 o'clock\"" then hung up the phone.  I arrive at 2pm to find closed doors.  Another man came along who thought they'd be open until 4pm as well, we tried to get the attention of a clerk who gestured to us that they were closed.  My nephew's christmas present is stuck there now.  If they would have given me the correct hours, I would have gone down earlier.  What bullshit!"
0;Sonora Quest Laboratories located on Frye Road in Chandler Az\n\nWhere do I begin the communication with clients is poor. i began going to this lab since January and I don't think there has been a month of no problem service. One month I choose to not go just to avoid getting upset....again.\n\nThey have given me blood work not once but twice that my Dr. never ordered and I had to pay for it.\nThey had double billed me for a test.\nEvery month I go for testing they cannot find my orders even though my Dr. has given them monthly orders for 6 months at a time.\nAnd today was the last straw even though they gave me blood test for July, August\nthey said they had no orders to draw my blood cause they expired in June. I had resubmitted new orders in May but THEY LOST THEM!!! They instead denied they ever got them upon which I informed them they drew blood illegally cause my work was drawn and my results were given to my Dr. and  I have copies for  myself. for months after June.\n\nLet's face it we all make mistakes  but to make a way of working out of it is just plain  incompetence.
4;Love, love, love the Pesto Chicken pizza with mozzarella!! I can eat one daily! All my picky kids love the pizza too and the fact that you can choose the style of you want and the toppings! Salads look great too although I've never had one. Fresh!
0;The associates are not helpful at all. Try to avoid this location.
0;The office acts a fool if you are even a few minutes late or cancel. They Even have the audacity to have a sign stating that they will charge you 50.00 if you fail through with your appointment time. Today, I brought my child 15 minutes late- knowing fully well that was time she was going to be in the waiting room anyway! The dentist says to tell me if I'm late or cancel again- I can't reschedule- #%^*?!!!! Obviously they think its okay to treat paying patients that way!!!
2;I had seen this place featured on the Pauly D Project and made a mental note to check it out during my next Vegas Visit.  On a date night out with the mister, we were about to check out the Griffin, but it was still closed.  We saw Insert Coin right across the street and decided to cross it off our To Do list. \n\nIt was past 5PM so there was no cover and the place wasn't crowded. The atmosphere was cool.  The bar was in the middle, so you can grab a drink while you played the arcade games. There were lounge areas that had X-Box consoles and flat screens, but I think you had to get table service to sit there.    It was cool to see all the vintage arcade games like Tron, Galaga, Dig Dug, etc, but I was disappointed that they didn't have the old Star Wars game, Donkey Kong, Q-Bert, or Burgertime.  Games are only 25 cents to play, so can't beat that.  \n\nOverall, the place it is a decent place to hang out, but I just wished they had more vintage arcade games.
2;Such a great place, amazing inventory. Unfortunately, I've never bought anything because it's so expensive. But I do like to go and just look. :)
1;The wonderful neapolitan-style pizzas here have gone down down hill.\nOvercooked, dry, almost inedible. What a shame!\nThey used to be so good.\n\nI suspect they have a new pizzaiolo cuz something has changed.\n\nThe rest of the food, made by Mimmo, is still excellent, but say bye-bye to the pizzas.
3;I really liked Other  Realm.  The owner was funny and gregarious.  \n\nYou see, I have a comic addiction, and I hadn't gotten my fix since I left San Diego, over a month and a half ago.  So I was needing some comics, man.  The owner, Mark, was sitting in front of his store in a folding chair, smoking a cigar, soaking up the sun when I walked by.  I asked if he was open and he led me right in.  The store is well laid out, and Mark told me that he could get me any major comic I'd like that wasn't in stock for no additional charge.  That struck me as fair, and definitely do-able.\n\nI liked it, so keep my review in mind with the other Yelp reviews.
3;Was here last week for the Yelp Breakfast Club UYE.  Even though we were potentially a large group we were seated quickly and had good service throughout the meal.  My breakfast meatloaf hash ( a chunk of meatloaf on a bed of onions, mushrooms, cheese, potatoes and eggs with the whole thing smothered in brown gravy)  was not only good but the serving was huge.  Everybody else in the group had good things to say about their choices.  Splitting checks was not a problem for them.
3;When we lived on Central ave. I think this is a restaurant we visited. I am not positive though. The food was great, but the yelling at the woman out front from tha back got to us. So we stopped going. But as I said, I am not sure this is the place, but it the right location.
0;:(
1;I went here to get a massage after rave reviews from a friend and being reasonably priced because I pulled a muscle in my neck and I needed it worked out.  Very friendly girls and the place is very nice, everyone was very professional (even the massage therapist.)  The guy starts with my legs and was working on them for a while and I was starting to think man, time is going really slow! And then a lady peeps her head in to tell him times up.. He thought I was getting a 90 min massage when I really wanted a 39 minute.  The therapist quickly tells me to lay on my stomach and massages my back and arms for maybe 5 minutes? Didn't even touch my neck.. but hey! My legs feel wonderful! I kinda feel cheated just because I'm still in pain, and I really wish now I would have just offered to pay him to fix my neck.. I want to go back to finish the job but I'm scared it's going to happen again and I don't want to waste my money..
3;I really dig this place - its a small, charming place that isn't overdone and doesn't take itself too serious...definitely a romantic vibe, and a nice break from a lot of the Old Town restaurants. \n\nThe wine prices are super cheap, in part because they sell wine for retail prices, and they'll usually let you sample a few wines before you pick your bottle for the evening.\n\nFor food, I love the house salad with gorgonzola dressing - I'd buy the gorgonzola dressing by the bottle if I could. For pizza, the vegetarian or the 5 cheese pizza are both great - if you love cheese, definitely go for the 5 cheese (cinque formaggi).\n\nWe've been a few times now and will be back again soon.
3;My best girl friend and I enjoyed a very pleasant stay there earlier this summer, July 1-3 which were WEEKDAYS. The hotel has a very airy and fresh feel it - lots of natural light, no screaming children, low smoke levels. It was less crowded than Wynn. I appreciated the fact that there weren't any slot machines or gambling tables visible or audible from the lobby. It definitely has a classier feel to it compared to many of the other hotels on the strip. I have mixed feelings on the butterfly motifs, but the overall experience totally trumps that minute detail, lol. Our room was spacious, well-lit and very comfy. Housekeeping was fine, no problem at guest services, in general I had no problem with any hotel staff. Parking wasn't a problem either. My one gripe was that it was like 115-120 degrees in Vegas at the time of my stay, and we couldn't use the mini-fridge to store any beverages or food because it's weight-sensitive. Also, wifi wasn't free. But all-in-all, I had a great time, and I would definitely consider staying there again (at least on weekdays).
1;"Mall goths, RUN!  Dejected teenagers, fresh out of their mother's minivans and \""Hot Topic\"" traipsing the area.  Careful or you'll trip over one! ;)"
2;This place is good, but not amazing. I don't make plans to come here for breakfast but if I'm around, this place is always satisfactory.\n\nI was here last 2 days ago (Sunday around noon) with a friend visiting Montreal and we ended up having brunch here. She is very selective with the foods that she eats, so the menu was perfect because it is extensive and offers many dish variations e.g. pancakes with fruits only or pancakes with the all-American breakfast plate. There is definitely something for all tastes and cravings. My only complaint is that every single smoothie contains bananas, which I can't eat.\n\nWe were sitting on the terrace which was nice because it was nice and sunny. In retrospect, I shouldn't have accepted the waitress' offer to sit on the sunny side of the terrace. Although it wasn't excruciatingly hot, after sitting there for a while, the sun and heat become uncomfortable. \n\nThe waiters were constantly moving around with chairs, reorganizing the terrace and this was distracting. At least, we didn't have to wait to get seated and the lineup never seemed to get long enough to really call it a lineup.\n\nThe food was good, not great. The potatoes are actually very good (many other breakfast places have disappointing potatoes in my opinion). The bacon was a little crunchy for my taste. The fruits were fresh and juicy.\n\nOverall, I would give this place 3.5 stars if I could. Everything about this place is alright, nothing really stands out, whether good or bad. So I will keep coming whenever I'm downtown and in need of brunch for a decent price.
0;I took the word of an acquaintance about Kinfolks and dropped in one Thursday night to give it a try.  And yes indeed I was genuinely hungry for BBQ.  \n\nAs noted, the place is unimpressive but this is rarely important as long as the food makes the grade.  Sadly, the gloomy interior was the highpoint.  \n\nI ordered the sampler plate, setting me back almost $15.00, with drink.  When Mr. Kinfolk placed the platter on my table, I couldn't believe he was serious.  The sausage looked as if it had just been peeled from underneath a semi-truck tire.  All the meats were tired.  Worn out. Spent. It was all dry and had a chemical aftertaste of petroleum.  \n\nMy heart sunk.  It was clear to me my meats had been lounging under the warmer, tanning perhaps after having been cooked earlier in the week.  \n\nAs my Dad says nature has a way of getting rid of the weak. It would have been nice had this occurred before losing my fifteen dollars.
2;"I heard that the Apollo Cafe had good soups; plus they are close to my office. I opted for the broccoli cheese soup...which was excellent. However I thought that they might have more Greek food on their menu. Not really. I opted to get the quiche (spinach, tomato, feta) as well. It was not bad, but I don't think it was worth the $5.25 that I paid for it (would have been happier with a bowl vs. a cup of the soup!). With a drink, everything came to more than $11...which isn't expensive....but isn't cheap enough for me to go every day either. Plus it's small inside and gets really crowded really quickly.\n\nOverall I was very pleased with the quality of the food. Marginally pleased with the price and atmosphere. I highly recommend the soup...but get it to go!"
2;I had a free entree from Big Burrito for my birthday, for which we decided to use at Casbah a few weeks ago. It was my first time there, though I've tried a few other BB restaurants in the past. \n\nFood: \n- Cracked pepper butter was delicious - I had to warn the waitress not to let me have any more bread and ruin my meal!\n- Grilled Bruschetta (ricotta, fava beans, Swiss chard,  preserved lemon, arugula, chervil, Calcagno) was a bit too lemon-y for my liking\n- Short Rib Raviolli (Short Rib Ravioli, Swiss chard, oyster mushrooms, roasted shallots, gremolata) was very savory and I would definitely order it again\n- Double-Cut Pork Chop (with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream, sage jus) was Joe's meal. I tasted a bit of everything and really enjoyed the kale. I like really really creamy risotto, and this wasn't quite there. I dont want to say it was undercooked, as I like I just like mine over-cooked.\n- Fried Apple Empanadas (vanilla bean cider reduction, toasted oat streusel,  \ncaramel ice cream) The ice cream was great, but the empanadas were bland to me.\n\nService: Not terrible. I understand at nice restaurants people enjoy taking their time to relax, enjoy their meals, and converse with their dinner-mates, but our server should have been more observant to the fact that we would be just sitting there with empty places waiting for the desert menu. I will note, though, that the table next to us returned two glasses of the same wine and the bartender came over and very politely suggested an alternative wine for the patron. They were very accommodating in this way. \n\nWill I go back? Someday - but I think I may try Soba or Kaya first.
3;Food, service and ambience excellent here.  The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is that it's in Planet Hollywood.  Taxi service there is bad.  But other than that.....food is excellent.  They make great steak and side dishes.  Been there several times and enjoy going back.  Make reservations though...it gets crowded. More of place you want to take friends or clients.  Not really good for kids.
1;Pancakes. I hate pancakes. \n\nJust kidding. Ever since I changed my icon to Grumpy Cat, I've been writing more 2-star reviews. Coincidence? I don't know. What I do know is that, Du-Par is an LA institution, and in my best grumpy face, I hated it. \n\nI've been to the Du-Par's in LA, and I remember it was unmemorable but I didn't hate it. I think it's the overall vibe of the LV location and the fact that there's so many better options within walking distance that left a distaste in my mouth. \n\nFirstly, if this review as based solely on the pancakes it would be 5-plus stars. Pancakes are awesome. Fluffy, crispy, buttery, all at the same time, the way pancakes were meant to be. A full stack will run around $10 but it's well worth it. \n\nAnother winner is their shrimp cocktail. For $3 you get a sundae cup's worth of medium sized shrimp with some crazy-good cocktail sauce. I liked it better when you they sold these at the snack bar but it's still a bargain but now you have to pay tip and sit down and be waited upon. \n\nSo... if the pancakes and shrimp are that good... why the two-stars? Everything pretty much negated the awesomeness of the pancakes. Their chicken soup was horrible, a sloppy mess of noodles with little to no chicken. They had a video playing that showed they make their noodles from scratch, which is what prompted me to get it. I love fresh made noodles, they're so light and airy. But I've found that if you overcook them, there is no forgiveness, they become a mushy mess! They're even worse than overcooked store-bought noodles. And these noodles tasted like they've been cooking all day. Gross. \n\nThe bf got the Vegas fried chicken, which was ok, but hardly worth the $9.50. It was an extra $3 for a less-than-par side salad. \n\nService was really sketchy. They switched out waiters during our meal and our second waitress seemed lost. Food came out slow. Orders were forgotten at the table next to us. They forgot one of our drinks. \n\nOverall, just not an enjoyable experience. My bf loves their shrimp cocktail but he'll have to go by himself, I doubt I'll come back after this visit. I just don't like pancakes that much.
2;Google maps said it's a 40 minute drive from my house (southwest LV), but I made it there in almost half the time. It was really easy to find and wasn't too crowded on a Sunday morning/early afternoon. The little duck pond and waterfall is cool, but stay away from the geese! If they even think you have food they'll start walking towards you. And, don't antagonize them. I saw some kids chasing them. They may look friendly, but they do bite.\n\nThe play area is cool. It's got a dinosaur themed sand pit, swings, and some slides. The main playground equipment is a 4 level structure with many slides of varying heights. It's perfect for kids 5 and up. Not so great for toddlers.\n\nThe splash pad is a lot smaller than I thought it would be and it's on some weird timer that only allows water to come out of one feature at a time. So, each time the water would come on, all the kids would migrate to that one feature. It makes the splash pad seem more crowded than it is and with all the kids wanting to get wet, some of the younger ones were pushed aside by the older kids.\n\nAs far as Las Vegas parks go, the look of this park is very cool, but the splash pad at Red Ridge park in the southwest is better. And, they don't have the variety of play equipment that Exploration Park does (also in the southwest). Aliante Nature park is definitely worth a visit if you live in the area, but if you live further south, I would suggest trying out some different parks.
4;"My 900th review is dedicated to the best night I had in 2014! I went here with my girlfriends to see David Guetta and had a blast. Beautiful nightclub and a lot of attractive people here ;). This club is pretty big, especially the outside area. I read somewhere this club was influenced by the curves of the human body... sounds kinda silly but once you see the club and the layout... it makes sense, lol.\n\nGetting drinks from the bar was pretty easy, as the bar is big and bartenders are fast. If you go with a group of girls, find a promoter and score free drink tickets! My girlfriends and I were literally on the dancefloor for 3 hours straight, no joke! All sober, no bar or bathroom breaks! I couldn't believe time passed by that fast. The club had good air conditioning, which is important...it kept us going lol. \n\nAs for leaving the club with a taxi, expect to wait a long time. We saw a huge line that pretty much crowded the entrance... seeing that we decided to walk back to the Cosmo which took us 20 minutes so we can grub on our 5AM pizza :) \n\nXS always grabs the best DJs for every weekend. Definitely can't wait to come back here and go loca."
1;Called for a price to replace an engine and transmission mount on my Honda Civic.  They quoted a price much lower than the dealership.  I told them exactly what was going on and what was needed before they gave me a price.  I made an appt to take it in.  I took the car in and, after 45 min, they told me that now that they had the VIN # they knew that a different mount was needed that would cost $200 more and that they couldn't get for 5 days.  I drove an hour to get there.  Why didn't they ask for the VIN # before they gave me a price and made an appt?  Needless to say, I'm not a happy camper.  And I'm pretty sure my other car was side swiped while sitting in their crowded parking lot.
0;My family and I decided to take a walk down the strip, leaving beautiful Paris for the lousy mall attached to MGM Grand. We were delighted to read such positive yelp reviews of Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak. What a mistake! These clowns are rude and crude. If you don't plan on ordering overpriced wine prepare to be treated bad. The food was meh.
0;"Yeah, don't even eat here.\n\nI didn't, so why am I reviewing this place? Simply because upon inquiring about whether or not they use the highly unhealthy (and some would say toxic, or even a chronic poison) hydrogenated oils in their donuts, the answer was \""yes.\""\n\nKrispy Kreme and Dunkin Donuts do this, as well, but there's no pretense at those places. Lamar's not only charges premium prices for the sub-par trans-fat riddled doughnuts they carry, but they even lie on their website, claiming: \""Our recipes have remained unchanged since 1933.\"" Sorry, folks, but I can guarantee there weren't hydrogenated oils in much of anything in the 1930s.\n\nMight as well just go to the nearest KK, DD, or QT if you're gonna eat that kind of crap; at least you'll be paying a more appropriate price for it.\n\nEDIT: I have been informed, by one courteous fellow Yelpster, that hydrogenated oils originated in the 1900s. With a bit of study, I found that Crisco, which is composed of hydro-oils, was in use in the 20s. So, perhaps they didn't lie about the recipes. However, the points about the dangers of hydrogenated oils and their ridiculous prices still stand, so *you* should \""stand\"" on the outside of their establishment."
1;This was a while ago, so I don't know if it's gotten better.  But since it wasn't a good experience for me 4 years ago, why would I go back?  The table service was not great at all, honestly, I don't think I saw the server again until we cashed out after she delivered the bottle.  The music was so so, could have been better.  They did have a small casino area which was cool, the outdoor area to look out into the strip and the roof opening was a cool experience as well, but for me, after the gimmicks, it ends.  I can only go outside and see the roof open only so many times.  I will say, I did see a drunken basketball player walking around with a bottle and that was hilarious, but that's about it.
0;"Let me start by saying, this is the first 1 star review I've ever given. That single sentence should speak for itself, but for those that prefer details please read on.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been dying to try this place for sometime, the planets line up correctly and we decided to give it a go... \n\nSERVICE-\n\nWe arrived at 5:30 on a weekday evening. the Hostess was friendly and somewhat prompt. as we we seated at our table, we noticed the Sushi bar was full but the dining room had vast seating. While the hostess selected for a very small table in direct sunset sunlight, we redirected her to a more spacious booth in a more comfortable area.\n\nWe were told the usual \""your server will be with you in just a moment\"" ... 30 mins later no one had even taken our drink order. This wasn't because they were swamped, there may have been 8 tables occupied at the time, but because our server was more interested in being a social butterfly than attending to our table.\n\nOnce we complained, the Chef came out to apologize. Nice enough guy and I would've been alright with things except instead of acknowledging the poor service, he made the excuse for his staff that there had been a \""simultaneous seating\"" which was FAR from true. At this point, I was truly looking forward to an exceptional and interesting meal. Oh the dreams of fools...\n\nFOOD -\n\nFor Appetizers, we opened with the Grilled 5 Spice Lamb Chops and the Korean Street Tacos. Both were just okay. Not as much flavor as I was expecting/hoping for. Best thing was the salad that accompanied the Lamb Chops\n\nNext we grabbed a couple of rolls of Sushi, The M Girl and a Geisha Girl. The sushi rolls were actually the best part of the meal and if by some odd twist of fate I end up in this place again, that is all I would have!\n\nIn the Rice/Noodles area we tried a couple of \""hard to get wrong\"" basic dishes, Chinese Fried Rice and Pad Thai Noodles. Both of these dishes were horrible to the point of complaint. They were both flavorless and greasy/oily. Just really poorly prepared and we had them removed from the bill.\n\nFor entrees, we tried the Beef & Broccoli along with the Crispy Fried Tai Snapper. Both had potential, but the sauces used were just way too sugary and sweet. I swear, the sauce on the snapper tasted like a diluted, warmed, jam.\n\nATMOSPHERE\n\nMost disappointing thing here wasn't even at our table, but directly in front of us. The hostess continued to seat patrons in a seating area where the refused to lower the blinds, though the dining area is surrounded by windows. We watched 3 sets of tables complain about the blinds while the 6:30-7:30 July western sun beamed down on them without mercy. No one in the establishment seemed to even care no matter what was said to them.\n\nEnter this establishment only if want to extend a horrible night at the tables and make it even worse. Invested $150+ and gained the knowledge that I will never set foot in the place on my own accord again."
1;Would rate it a 3, but they happen to have a local posse of TSA humanoids that are the mouthiest I've seen. \n\nAlso, amazed at the amount of fucktards playing slots. Wake up. These are worse odds than Keno or the Big Wheel when you walk into a casino. \n\nStill gets stars for amenities, Starbucks, food, all the stuff you'd expect.
4;Amazing instructors and they take donations not a set fee. Be generous. :)
1;I'm starting to really resent this Harris Teeter, but it's the closest grocery store to my house and I end up going back there for convenience.   I take home produce and cut into it to find it's spoiled.  Last week I got a package of hamburger that they'd cleverly packed so that it was pink and fresh-looking on the outside and then when I picked it up it was slimy and grey on the inside (how do they DO that?)  And you know, I don't have a lot of spare time to go hang around the customer service counter with my brown mealy peaches or my stinky meat and beg for my money back.
0;Sooooo Sad that this place is not so good anymore... Pizza is still tasty, but the roasted beet salad I fell in love with when I was first coming here went to pot.  The roasted beet salad used to have fresh, roasted beets, crumbled cheese, and a really good vinaigrette that used to pack a punch.  It is now a sad bowl of canned beets sitting on some lettuce leaves with a small container of tasteless vinaigrette on the side.  Yuck. I almost sent it back but decided to seriously doctor it up with lots of parmesan cheese, salt and pepper.  We also ordered Pasta Fagoli and paid for it to only be told later that they didn't have soup.  OK... its not like the kitchen isn't surrounding the cashier for her to simply turn to someone and check... We were given a number on a stick so they could locate us when the order came out.  Again the server still walked around in a daze holding plates of food or beers asking each table if they ordered this or that... Isnt that what the numbers on a stick are for? We should have just said yes to everything she brought to our table, but im not a jerk.  When our order finally came up it sat on the counter and we just went up and got it ourselves.  Too bad, wont come back or recommend it either, too many restaurants in this town who have their act together
3;Ginseng seems to be a hidden gem, probably because it's still fairly new and it's in a location that doesn't get much foot traffic (up a few escalators in Imperial Palace).  The place wasn't very crowded around dinnertime, which was a bad first sign.  However, the ethnic composition of the clientele was pretty heavily Asian, which was a good second sign.\n\nThey did not disappoint.  Their Korean dishes were not A++, but they were pretty authentic and good quality.  12 bucks is a little more than I want to pay for soon tofu, but hey, it's Vegas.  Plus, you still get the free kimchee and assorted appetizers.  They also have some Chinese and Japanese dishes that looked to be reasonably authentic.\n\nAnd, as everyone before me has mentioned:  open 24/7 ftw!
4;Bilbee and Geronimo did a great job with my project! I was blown away by the professionalism and the energy they brought to my job. I will absolutely use them again!
2;"This place is just okay. Went there for \""linner\"" today. Pretentious decor - bottles of olive oil, large decorational jars of pasta etc arranged in open-faced cabinetry right in the middle of the seating area (dividing it into two), coupled with giant neon \""Fat Tire\"" and other beer signs suiting a sports bar more than this type of place. I ordered the athenian yeeros pita. Wife had rigatoni. She said hers tasted bog average. Her salad was a boring green salad with raw mushrooms and a dollop of dressing. I asked for fries with my pita and that's what I got - mostly dry shoestring fries that looked like they came straight out of an Ore-Ida pack, along with a container of ketchup (exactly what you go get when you're at In-N-Out). The best thing about the meal was the pita - hot and fresh. Inside the pita was yeeros meat and a crapload of onion. That's it. No tzatziki, no tomato. And I didn't ask for any since I was starving and we had to get to Costco before it closed. Waiter was okay, kept our drinks filled etc, no problem there, but this place gets precisely three stars - nothing great, nothing abysmal. Flatline. PS: See if you can spot my wife's review."
4;I recently had my 3rd haircut/color with Rick at R Salon.  I have been extremely happy with every appointment I have had there.  Rick is fantastic at listening to my ideas and delivering exactly what looks great for my hair type.  He has even already picked up on the fact that I like to change my look frequently and is always up to the challenge!\n\nThe staff at the salon are very friendly (no snobby salon attitudes here!), and Rick's assistant, Carrie, works with him like she reads his mind!  \n\nPrices are very reasonable, and I have never had a problem getting a late appointment.\n\nI am now a devoted customer!!!!
0;The first time when we went here the food was really good. However the quality decreased a lot . We went there atleast four -5 times but the food was really bad.The biryani was really bad. It had too much of spices. The place was really under-staffed.And we had to wait atleast for fifteen minutes to be seated. I will not return to this restaurant again
2;Junkie and I have history and good history I tell ya! nye gay kiss @ the junkie, birthday table service @ the junkie, cute boy flirtations? again @ the junkie.  awesome bartender service... yea @ the junkie and... memorable nights... oh junkie you and I just mesh well! It's one of the larger clubs in Old Town, by day and early evening a resto (with good pizza, I must add!) and late night a ragin' club. With three bars, two patios, a semi-existent dance floor by the dj booth and next to the lounge bar, plenty of room to roam and most times I've been there a decent looking crowd it's a good spot to go when you're out and about at Old Town. It really depends on the night but the music's very danceable and DJ Rolemodel takes requests (I know coz I text mine to him). The spin wheel above the bar is nothin big coz a shot is really a swig from schnapps, I'll pass and usually my luck is coz i'm already kinda tipsy... it goes up my nose. not a good thing =( Junkie is usually my go to place when nothin else in Old Town gets my fancy and is a great alternative to BS West. lol.
1;"I gave 2 stars because the only good thing about this place were the bloody Marys and the staff. The TVs were older and one was green. It SAYS on the website and on the MENU that they have a bloody Mary bar (the entire reason we went) but no, they tell you, \""we make it for you how u want\"". No shit..so does every other bar. I want to make it my self! Not to mention the were $5 a piece and the first one had very little vodka. I ordered an omelet, one of 2 on the menu, and it was wrong, the have no ketchup bottles only cup served with your meal. We will never go back again.. there was no offer to correct my bill for the wrong food, I was asked if I wanted a new omelet but I was starving and not waiting another min. My husband was charger $1.00 for one slice of toast. Ugh..bad, bad business!!"
3;Over the weekend I took my bike out and road the canals towards Camelback Road.  I stopped at Taco Del Mar on Camelback and 40th Street.   I sometimes stop in the middle of my ride to have lunch at this location.  I am always satisfied with the tacos.  I got three tacos - chicken and shredded beef.  The food is light and tasty, yet simple without all of the fillers (e.g. cheddar cheese and sour cream).  I always enjoy stopping here when I have the chance. \n\nThe atmosphere is simple with a surfer theme and a television in front.  The portions are modest - not too heavy, not too light.\n\nThe salsa selection is very good with green and red salsa in various strengths.  Reasonably priced at about $5.00 to $8.00 per person.\n\nA great stop for a simple and fulfilling lunch.
1;Great bar menu. Cheap scotch. Awesome beer selection.\n\nDefinitely a great place to have drinks, just make sure you eat before you come. They have the worst food ever. I honestly don't understand how they've received a single award for their food. It's always bland or weird and usually over cooked.\n\nI'd grab a cocktail here any day but I'd get a pizza delivered if I got munchy.
1;Very disappointing. Not traditional Chinese food. Not worth the money.
2;I have tried this place 2x's. 1st time was ok, and affordable . I had a gel manicure and regular pedicure. Their selection of colors are minimal for gel. 2nd time I went the pedicure was poorly done. I wish it was better - I need a clean, affordable, convenient place to go.
3;Amazing food for the price. I love the cucumber salad they start you off with. The bento box is also awesome. It's great if you want just a little bit of everything and at around $8, it was well worth every penny. Their sushi alone is also amazing. It feels more like a traditional Japanese restaurant compared to other restaurants in Champaign. I'll definitely be back!
3;I went a few times for Tuesday ramen, rather than the traditional fare. It was pretty good. Staff was friendly.
0;"The monthly price is wonderful, that being said they spend the rest of your membership trying to squeeze every dollar they can out of you. I tried to change my payment date and was told that the only way to do so was to cancel my membership, pay the cancellation fee and come back on the day of the month that I want my payment to be, re sign up and pay another \""annual fee\"" of $39 even though I just paid that when I signed up three months before. Oh, and don't forget your towel. If you don't have one you have to buy one of theirs for a dollar, just another way that they grab at our wallets. I'm not even going to get into the pain that cancelling the membership is and the extra costs that they tack on. The cheap monthly cost isn't even worth it because the gym is always packed, even at 5am. I'm so happy that I'm finished with Gold's."
1;"Gro\u00dfe Sportsbar in KA Neureuth  Viele M\u00f6glichkeiten sich ein wenig auszutoben  einige Billardtische, 3 Darts, Airhockeytisch, und noch eine menge mehr M\u00f6glichkeiten  soweit das positive ;-)\nWas mich allerdings sehr st\u00f6rt ist das die T\u00fcr zum raucherraum dauerhaft auf ist, und man somit nach einem Abend Sportsbar riecht wie ein Aschenbecher. Die teilweise viel zu laute Musik wiederholt sich gef\u00fchlt alle 30 Minuten und das essen schmeckt mir auch nicht wirklich. Aber die Getr\u00e4nke sind OK :-)\nAlles im Allem als Sportsbar recht nett vor allem wenn die T\u00fcr zum Raucherbereich mal geschlossen w\u00e4re."
1;When I heard that this place was owned by Pizzeria Bianco, I was kind of excited, but two lunches later, I've filed this away as just a bad idea. The food - at least the two sandwiches I tried - were okay, but just not anything special. Perhaps my expectations were high, both because of the pedigree and the excellent place that occupied that location just before, and that made for greater disappointment. But nothing can change the fact that the lunch menu  is extremely restricted - 3 salads, 3 sandwiches and a couple of pastas, from what I recall. The sandwiches were served on crusty bread. Now I'm a huge fan of crusty bread (I mean I even nodded in agreement during the scene in Ratatouille where the chef says a good bread talks to you), but that's what I want for my bruschettam antipasti plate or with an olive oil and grated cheese dip - for sandwiches I expect something easier to bite into without the risk of taking out the eye of my dining companions, a focaccia or ciabatta perhaps. \nOne can guarantee that you will not be walking away over-full. A guarantee that you'll be satisfied or wish to return is as close to impossible as getting a side of balsamic vinegar with your sandwich there. The good news perhaps is that there still is an excellent lunch alternative in Cyprus Pita Grill next to it, and should you, like I and my friends, still have an empty feeling after lunch, there's Yogurtology just  down the line.
2;"Deep in the masterplanned behemoth of Mountains Edge this cafe is cute, efficient and great for a snack after house hunting. A tiny cottage setting, the food was good, service was quick and the price was right. \n\nAttached to a bar, the day we visited there were about 150 bikers in the parking lot, no joke. They were having a fundraiser and there was live music which we could hear through the wall. No big thang, didn't change the way the food tasted. I think the owner was afraid we would u turn it out of the parking lot, he practically waved us in from the street. We were alerted that \""it's not usually like this\"". haha I had the Salad Wrap which was fresh and tasty. The drinks come in basically vats. \nThe menu had a good variety for both lunch and breakfast. Sandwiches, burgers, omelettes, the usual. Homemade mac or potato salad..but hope you like celery. It's plentiful. \n\nThe desserts sounded awesome but we declined. Brownie sundae, peach cobbler...and you know it was gonna be warm with ice cream and...damn we should have gotten it. \n\nAll the more reason to delve deep into Mountains Edge once again!"
0;Beautiful setting but I've gone about 5 times and the service is poor. The servers are never around and never check on us.
2;Good place to stop for a beer and grab a bite to eat. On a side street in New York New York. Outside setting was great. Waiters were on it, order taken and food recived. \nFood was decent and the beer was cold. Plenty of  people watching time, the staff didn't push you along after your meal. \nLast word... Relaxing.
3;We've eaten at Monty's a number of times and have always had good food there.   Service has also been good to excellent.   The veggie quesadilla is quite good.   Their prices are a little higher than we would like.\nBathroom and restaurant is very clean. \nWhen we are in the mood for something vegetarian Monty's is a safe bet.\nI wouldn't really say I'm a fan but they do enough right to get 4 stars.
2;"Is Blazin' really as hot as it gets here? I don't know if I've developed some iron palate or whether it's the suits at corporate telling them that anything spicier will scare off the middle America fanny packer crowd. But that's their hottest sauce, and while it's got a robust flavor, it just doesn't come anywhere near the kind of heat I crave as the kind of capsaicin addict who's not satisfied until... well, the less said about that the better.\n\nMy point is, if you're going to be a wing place, give people a chance to really challenge their taste buds. I think even Hooters' 3 Mile Island is hotter.\n\nThat being said, I also love the Caribbean Jerk sauce even though it's barely hot at all - it's not supposed to be. The Spicy Garlic is more vinegar-based, tangy in such a way that sometimes seems more aggressive than the Blazin'. As for the Asian Zing? I didn't think it had much zing at all, it just tasted sweet. I was hoping for more soy/sesame based but I think it's more sweet & sour. Pass. Mango Habanero: could taste lots of mango, barely any habanero. Alsop ass.\n\nThe \""buffalo chips\"" suffer from the same starchy, wan fate as your average steak fry.\n\nBWW gains points for being open 24/7/365, which is nothing notable in this town until you consider that it's a buffalo wing place, and for having a staff that's always friendly. They also offer free wi-fi.\n\nI go here all the time because it's close and convenient moreso than because it's great. But it's good enough. Probably more like 3.5 stars, but of course Yelp doesn't give that option."
1;The laser tag was ok, it's not very big. And $7 for 5 minutes of running in a small space just doesn't entice me enough to want to come back. Tried the mini golf too, the 3D thing really wasn't working for us, my kids didn't even want to wear the glasses because the kids were complaining that it made them dizzy because it was blurry to look through. The arcade is funny, not really much of an arcade, the decor is done very cheaply, it looks like they are in the process of renovating(but not). The second room of the arcade has only a few games by which the others were out of order. The mini golf is outdated. I suggest doing the laser tag instead but don't know if I would come back to do that.
2;The one thing that Claim Jumper does that makes it unique is HUGE SERVINGS.  We're talking, leftovers for days servings.  The service is usually pretty attentive and quick, although there can be a bit of a wait some evenings.\n\nThis is my mom's place to go out to eat when she has her choice.  It's...OK.  I mean, yeah, it's huge - but sometimes you sacrifice quality for quantity.  It's pretty much standard, chain, Apostrophe S food.  Nothing thrilling.\n\nTheir huge chocolate cake slice, however, rules the school.  7 or 9 layers or something like that.  I blame it for my stomach.
0;Went there & no healthy options!!! All Sugar in everything & KFC or Churches tastes better!! Tea is bitter & instead of making a better kind it is turned into a sugar syrup
2;I've gone to Zojo a few more times now. The espresso is hit or miss. Some days it's delicious and other days it is very bad. So far I haven't been able to figure out when I will get espresso or garbage water.
0;Poor customer service . I'll never go back there again or refer anyone.
3;I had purchased a package plan on Groupon for a 60 minute Swedish massage, 55 minute facial, manicure, and pedicure. I had a mixed experience from beginning to end. The front desk attendant that greeted me was friendly and made small talk as I was walking to the waiting area. She was professional and warm, addressing me by name, which gave me the impression that this was going to be an amazing experience.\n\nThe massage was first on today's agenda. My masseuse came storming in to the waiting area frazzled and in street clothes. Makes me think she was running a little late. I was quickly ushered into the room to get ready. Once we were settled, she was straight to the point and got the job done. I appreciated her asking about my preference in pressure. I asked for as much as she could provide. She complied and worked wonders. I did not come out as sore as a deep tissue, but enough to have me dozing off in bliss.\n\nWithin five minutes of finishing the massage, the esthetician came to retrieve me. For some reason, I felt like I was impeding on her time. Once I was in, she was rushing through prep which created quite a bit of noise. Normally, these experience should lull you into a state of calm, but I was on edge most of the time. She could sense it when giving me an arm massage because I was locking up. She became more friendly from then on.\n\nI finished my trip to the spa off on a wonderful note. Phyllis is a true delight. My friends manicurist and her were a hoot to talk to. They worked quickly without the feeling of being rushed out. Nothing was off limits. By the end I came out really enjoying my experience and have a few suggestions on where to go get some soul food. WIN!
4;Just finished four spectacular day's at Encore. My husband and I stayed at Encore from Thursday to Monday. This was our first stay at a Wynn property. Previously we have stayed at Belagio,The Hotel at Mandalay and Palzazzo. This was by far our favorite. Everything from restaurants to pools were excellent. We did venture over to a few other hotels Fri and Sat night but we were very glad to be returning to the serenity of the Encore.
3;For getting things on the cheapie side, I've found that they have a great sales rack.\n\nApart from that though a lot of things are marked as per retail outlet prices. They sometimes have some good deals on t-shirts as well.\n\nBut the main reason I come back here whenever I'm in Vegas is because I always need more Jack Skellington PJ's - and they deliver on this front.\n\nI scored a great zip up hoodie as well for $10 from the sale rack. So you can sometimes find a great deal!
2;"Ummmm I don't quite understand this and maybe I never will.........???? I recently moved to LV in October and despite having many opportunities to visit the strip I just never had a burning desire to cruise around here.\n\n  The homeless guy with a sign that read \""Wife had a sex change operation and then she ran off with my girlfriend\""\nThe paisano with his accordion while singing off key\nThe guy's walking around with signs strapped to their back while yelling \""wings &beer! And don't forget the hooters man!\""\nHalf price ticket kiosks littered at strategic locations\nTshirt shops that sell leopard skin flasks,key chains,and shit glasses\nSuburban white boys screaming \"" oooooohhhhhhhh yes bro!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Woooooooooooo good times man hur hur \"" while chugging cheap beer and strutting in their counterfeit Ed Hardy finery\nA ton of restaurants that mainly chains or gaudy themed establishments, but I'm sure there are a few decent spots if you seek them out"
4;Really nice and thoughtful people at this store, prices are fair, they do their best and thats good enough for me.  Easy access through Dicks sporting goods, stay on 1st floor go straight ahead on left.
1;I was super excited when I saw a groupon come up for this place. I had heard it was really good from more than one person. Man, was I mislead.\n\nMy Girlfriend and I started out with some edamame and miso soup. Both of those were pretty good, but not what I came for. We ordered 4 rolls: spicy tuna, avocado eel,  a deep fried one with peanuts and a samurai roll which consisted of a bunch of fish wrapped in seaweed. They ranged from bland to average.  The Samurai roll was the worst offender and I'm sorry to say that we didn't even bother to eat all of it.\n\nI don't think I'll be finding my way back here for sushi any time soon.
0;This is the worst Danny's I have ever been to. Whoever runs this location should be ashamed of yourself. I have been to the other locations and NEVER had the experience I had here. I even heard other people complaining while I was in there. I would've rather waited an extra 15 minutes to actually get my car washed.....there was dust, yes dust not dirt or grime or something hard to get off, still on my steering wheel and radio. The back of the car wasn't even vacuumed out. I paid for a works, there was no air freshener in my car. On top of not getting the car wash I paid for they stole my   auxiliary cord. When I called they asked if I saw someone steal it? Of course not they are inside my car and in sitting on the sidelines, it's not like I'm standing over my car watching their every move. They told me they would keep and eye out for it......
2;This is just what we needed as a pick-me-up for our 4 hour drive to Myrtle Beach from Charlotte. The people were friendly, the food was good, and it was fast service. It reminded me of a Wendy's type atmosphere. All of the Bojangle's we passed were packed, including this one. They have a really great business, and although they are a huge chain, it was nice to try for the first time. Besides, a chicken biscuit? Who could pass that up?!
3;"Before going to Las Vegas for my best friend's 21st birthday I asked around a bit for recommendations of restaurants to take him to. The typical suggestions were given (Michael Mina, Jo\u00ebl Robuchon, etc) but one name stood out in my mind; B and B Ristorante. I did my research on the place and found out that it's on the amazing list of Mario Batali owned restaurants. Perfect. The same friend and I just recently went to Manhattan for my college graduation and we ate at multiple Batali restaurants (Lupa and P\u00f3) which both blew us away. I've also dined at his Los Angeles restaurant, Pizzeria Mozza (next door to Osteria Mozza). Each and every time I've dined at a Batali owned restaurant my stomach has left extremely happy and my wallet isn't too hurt. B and B was a perfect choice to celebrate my friend's second birthday dinner.\n\nB and B is inside the very classy Venetian Hotel and is tucked on Restaurant Row. It's Friday night in Vegas so the casino floor is bumpin' and there are suits and cocktail dresses galore while walking to the restaurant. Thankfully we came prepared and were sporting our suits as well. After walking the million or so steps through the humongous hotel/casino we arrived in front of B and B and were happily greeted by the two gorgeous hostesses. We then were led to our seats against the \""window\"" in a cozy half booth half table. Sitting by the window was great because the people watching outside couldn't be beat. Out of all the hotels we went to beforehand, the Venetian definitely had the most attractive, interesting, and fun-looking crowd.\n\nOur extremely professional server came over to greet us and take our drink orders. Right away we felt as if we had been teleported off the bustling Las Vegas Strip and into a fine dining restaurant tucked under a stoop in NYC. After looking over the menu we came to our decisions.\n\nTo start, we got one order of calamari and seppie fritti to share. This was probably the best calamari I've tasted in my life. The sauce at the bottom complimented the calamari perfectly by adding a slight spice to each bite but not enough to knock you out of your chair. We devoured the dish pretty quickly and then sat back to wait for our pastas.\n\nMy friend and I are big pasta lovers so we stuck to the Primi section of the menu. My friend ordered the spaghettini (with spicy budding chives, sweet garlic and one-pound lobster). The second my friend said his order our server got ecstatic. He said it was one of their best dishes and also one of their most popular. He then described in great detail exactly how it is prepared as well as how each ingredient compliments the next. Whoa. \""This guy knows his shit.\"" For me, I got the goat cheese tortelloni (with dried orange and wild fennel pollen). Again, our pro-status server then described how it's cooked and how the ingredients would taste with each other. My friend's dish was amazing. It had a small kick of spice but the lobster helped even out the flavor. Also, the lobster was the most tender, melt-in-your-mouth lobster I've ever tasted. My dish was also fabulous. I'm sold immediately to any dish that is prepared with goat cheese and this dish didn't upset. The milky goat cheese gave an explosion of flavor with each bite and the tiny shavings of orange offered a different and interesting flavor every third bite or so.\n\nBefore our meal started I told our server very discretely that it was my friend's birthday. He said that if we order a dessert they will add a candle but they don't offer any special (by this I mean complimentary) birthday desserts. Hm, oh well. We ordered the dark chocolate torta (with spiced huckleberries). Sure enough, out came a candle and script writing on the side of the dish. It looked beautiful (as well as delicious). Needless to say, we devoured this thing pretty damn quick as well.\n\nBeing familiar with Mario Batali's cooking we both came in knowing exactly what to expect; an amazing meal. We both left very satisfied. We then proudly and excitedly crossed yet another Batali restaurant off our list."
0;"I have been to this place a number of times, it used to be called Ballantyne Nail Spa. Based on my experience Sunday I would have to say the service changed with the name and not for the better. I asked for a gel color change for my hands and a polish change for my toes. I believe the woman that did my nails is married to the man that owns the establishment so she is part owner. I had red nail polish on my toes and I was going to a neutral color. When she finished painting my toes and I was looking at her work I noticed that she didn't completely paint my little toe and I could still see red nail polish. I brought it to her attention and she tried to tell me it was because of \""my cuticle\"" meanwhile she puts nail polish remover on a cotton ball and I can see red nail polish on it. She proceeded to use a nail file and hit the toe right next to it. I didn't say anything and when she was looking at her work I guess she realized I would notice that the toe was messed up and started to remove the nail polish off of that toe so she could redo it. At the same time she is removing the nail polish she tells me that I need to keep my toes separated as if I caused  the nail polish to get messed up. I said \""No, you hit that toe with the nail file. \n\nShe did my finger nails and needless to say they were a mess. I didn't complain about them because I was so frustrated and I just wanted to get out of there. She asked me if I wanted to pay before she started my nails I told her no because I planned to use the foot dryer when she got done with my finger nails. She said I wouldn't need to, I politely said no, I would like to because for some reason it takes along time for my nails to dry and I didn't want them to get messed up. She immediately started speaking in her language I knew she was talking about me because her husband immediately glanced over at me. I said \""I'm sorry is there a problem with me using the foot dryer\"" she never said a word her husband actually responded and said \""absolutely not\"". \n\nIt amazes me the lack of respect that some people have as if because you are an American you are supposed to be stupid. I may not have known exactly what she said but I'm smart enough to know when I'm being talked about to my face. So inappropriate and rude.....They will never get my business again. What is with always thinking you are right and are infallible anyways???? They will never get my business again! I wish I could say that in several languages"
3;This place was referred to me by my nail technician who said we'd likely be the only non Asian people there and she was right. The food was really good, fast and inexpensive.  My husband and I had different entrees and loved them both. The service was friendly even though the server clearly didn't understand much of what we said.  This place was also SPOTLESSLY CLEAN which always makes me a fan.
4;You get what you pay for. Very expensive.
0;DO NOT GO HERE! Oh my God, I didn't realize we can post reviews for hotel here otherwise I would have done this a lot sooner.  I was here last year on Labor day weekend.  Let me just say this is the most worst and unprofessional Westin I have been to and will not be back for a long time.  First off...they put us on the floor where the pets were (we reserved 3 rooms) we didn't realize it until we heard a bunch of dogs barking...not only that a bunch of us got bed bug bites all over our back.  (sickening) then we ordered room service, they messed up on that order and then it took about a whole hour to receive my refund which they didn't even do correctly and refunded back the whole bill when they were suppose to just refund 1 item (idiots! but that's good for me) to top it all off, my friends booked 2 separate couple massages only 1 couple massage happened because they woman that booked the appointment thought it was only for one couple well in fact we clearly said on the phone.  It was a disaster!!  They only compensation was a free massage (only to be used at the Westin Las Vegas)\n\nthis place is pathetic!  Maybe others have had a more pleasant stay but ours was a nightmare.\n\nMight I lastly add, I learned that this a privately owned Westin which probably explains that sorry ass service.
3;I really like this place. One of the better Mexican restaurants in the valley. They have great food and their prices weren't outrageous. I sat outside right by a heater... it was heaven. The service was good. Our food was brought out to us right away, but the waiter neglected to notice our empty drink cups. I understand it was busy, and he looked like he was the only one outside at the time, but we were thirsty! All in all, I was satisfied. After we eat there, we usually go and sit up on South Mountain and watch the city lights and walk off the food, lol.
2;Had a sangwich at their food booth during the jazz fest.\n\nThis restaurant had a food booth set up at the Place des Arts during the jazz fest--in fact, it was one of the only booths in the area, save for some hot dog/sausage vendors. On consecutive days, had the tasty bavette de boeuf (skirt steak) and saucisse (sausage) sangwiches, both with chimichurri and criolla sauce. Somewhat overpriced at ~$10 CAD for half a sangwich, but I suppose that's to be expected at the jazz fest.\n\nOverall, it was a decent place to get a quick bite during the jazz fest--a step up from the average cart vendor, without the obvious wait from sitting down at a brick & mortar.
2;"By way of introduction, this is a very upscale Chinese restaurant in the Wynn in Las Vegas. It's the first and only Chinese restaurant to receive a Michelin Star, which is one of the reasons why we were so eager to try it. \n\nFirst, the good: \n- The restaurant is at the Wynn, which means the decor is over-the-top pretty. You sit in huge chairs, and the surroundings are positively opulent. \n- The service was quite good, for us at least. The restaurant wasn't at all busy, so perhaps this helps. \n- The food was really very tasty. It was quite good. Here are some highlights: \n     - The duck salad appetizer was really tasty. It had a crispy bowl of sesame seed crackers, and really yummy light truffle dressing. It was easily the most innovative dish of the whole meal. Try this! \n     - The pot stickers were just that -- four pot stickers. Price? $15!!?!?!?!?!\n     - The kung pao chicken was really good. \n     - A very surprising thing: get the CHILI SAUCE. We were like \""wow, why does everything have this delicious subtle cinnamon(y) flavor to it?\"" The chili sauce! Very tasty. \n     - The general tao chicken was also tasty. \n     - The fried rice was good, and filled with shrimp. \n     - The wine list, by the glass, wasn't bad at all. \n\nThen, the interesting: \n- OK, when you go around the Wynn it's like this: white person, white person, Latino person, white person, Indian person, white person, white person. When you get to Wing Lei it's like they stuffed ALL OF THE ASIAN PEOPLE in the Asian restaurant. They aren't anywhere else, and there's no one but Asian people here. Kind of odd. \n\nLastly, the bad: \n- Umm, the ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE DOLLARS the dinner cost us. We got two appetizers, two mediocre soups, two entrees, fried rice, and two glasses of wine. No dessert. That's a lot of money for really good but still pretty standard Chinese food. Aside from the duck salad and the chili sauce, there was nothing really outstanding about the food. It was all good, but not $200 good. \n- The aforementioned soups (won ton and hot and sour) were pretty standard. Nothing special here. \n\nIn sum, the food was good, but how did this get a Michelin Star?"
4;I brought a TON of items/uniforms here to get washed for work, honestly it was a HUGE amount. I brought it all specifically separated (but didn't expect that they would leave it as so) and requested to please have it sanitized. I asked it be ready in a day/day a a half and when I went to pick up I was VERY happy with what I received!! Everything was clean and nice smelling and it was separated as specifically as I had dropped it off. Everything was folded and made my life so much easier when it came time to put it all away. All this for only $35!! I will definitely be coming back and using Waschen Guer's service. :)
4;Came here for my graduation lunch and I gotta say more restaurants need to be modeled after this establishment. The food and service were impeccable. I made reservations and arrived early and they were able to accommodate us. After warmly greeting us, we made our way to the table. Throughout our meal, the staff were very attentive and checked in on us very often for refills and making sure we were enjoying the food. \n\nHere's what we had:\n-warm baguette and focaccia rolls: freeeeee! \n\n-calamari\n\n-toasted ravioli\n\n-shrimp and salmon milanese served with risotto (fish was cooked very well and shrimp was succulent)\n\n-sea bass with cauliflower pur\u00e9e \n\n-cheese and prosciutto stuffed pork chop with asparagus\n\n-lobster pizza (my fav - crust was buttery and lobster was so tender)\n\nOverall, I had an amazing experience! Highly recommend this place!
3;Das Lago Bowling Center ist eine Freizeith\u00fctte, die neben Bowling auch Billard, Kicker, Dart und Airkockey zu bieten hat. Man w\u00fcrd auch ordentlich mit Getr\u00e4nken und Speisen versorgt und wenn man auf Angebote achtet, ist es auch gar nicht mal so teuer. Waren z.B. an einem Mittwoch und das gabs jede Pizza f\u00fcr 5 Euro. Bowling wird pro Spiel und Person bezahlt, da braucht man sich keine Sorgen machen, da man nur das zahl was man selbst auch gespielt hat. Die Bahn und Kugeln sind in einem sehr guten Zustand.
4;Fabulous meal.  We shared the pate appetizer.  I had the roast chicken and my friend had mussels.  We shared the chocolate mousse for dessert.  It was all so good and our waiter was terrific.  Definitely worth it.
0;"My first experience here was not bad (personally speaking). Someone was bleeding in the packed waiting room. It was busy; none of the medical professionals stopped to ask the bleeding man if he was ok. And it was apparent that he was in pain because from time to time you heard him groaning. My second time here (1992), my sister, older brother and I were in a car accident; my sister & I were rushed to the hospital in an ambulance, but we were left strapped in the gurneys for a few hours before getting any attention. Ridiculous. I should've known, since witnessing the bleeding man in the waiting room incident, that we would be ingored as well.\n\nThe expansion of the hospital brought on a maze-like feeling, as you were trying to get from one place to another, but finding that it's only confusing the hell out of you. You can walk and walk and walk. It's kinda like the street layout of Las Vegas- they didn't think that the city was going to get bigger and that's why the streets end and reconnect whereever they want (Harmon goes through UNLV, Spring Mountain turns into Sands that turns into Twain, etc.).\n\nFast forward to the sexual assaults that some patients fell victim to, the bankruptcy, the CEO getting charged with embezzlement- it's no wonder why this is a hospital to avoid. Unfortunately this is The hospital for trauma."
4;Elenir is the BEST in town!! I have lived here my entire life and has been getting treatments for about 6 years at different spas but will never go anywhere else again. On a personal note Elenir is one of the nicest and most patient people I have ever met. She even gave me some free tips on the best kind of skin care products to use at home, not even trying to sell me crap I don't need, just making great suggestions based on her years in the industry. Very much appreciated when everyone else in town just wants to squeeze money out of you.
3;Just moved here from DC and had a tough time finding a superb Thai restaurant in Charlotte. I must say this place has saved my lifeeee!! I ordered takeout from here and The pan see-eu was so delicious. The broccoli was cooked to perfection. In addition I order my cousin the shrimp fried rice the presentation was beautiful. I'm glad I found this place. Thank you.
3;Service was good, food was okay I'd give it 3. Stars for food and 4 for service. The guacamole was really good- got some fresh homemade tortillas to go with it. I got a veggie burrito and I heard the chicken enchiladas were okay.
2;Located in the upstair area of the Palazzo... Ate here a few months back. I LOVE Kobe beef, so I got their Kobe beef Tobayaki... and it just wasn't for me... BUT their varieties of sashimi and samba rolls with the Brazilian and Peruvian flavored sauces were really good! Next time I eat here, I will just focus on that... and not be a loser and blow $80-$100 on a dish that I didn't like that much.  o_O \n\nTalk about losing money in Vegas...
4;You just can't go wrong with Durant's.  I've been a customer for 30 years and still love everything about this place.  The atmosphere, the service, the food...all 5 star!  Whether you are just stopping by for a few cocktails on your way downtown or spending the evening eating dinner in the restaurant, Durant's will never disappoint.  Great dishes include Cocktail shrimp (fresh daily), Chicken Marsala, Pea soup, Oysters, and of course, their Onion Rings!   If you're looking for a quiet yet elegant, place to take a date or even the family, that place is Durant's.
4;My taste for music is as moody as I can be sometimes and last week I was feeling hard rock. Luckily, I found out that one of my favorite bands, Volbeat, was performing that night along side Hellyea, at the House of Blues. My husband bought the tickets and we headed over on a Thursday evening.\n\nThe venue is not huge but I didn't feel like it was too crowded, just what you can expect from a rock concert. We had seats on the balcony and it was actually very nice to watch the band and the crazy pit from up there - made me be thankful for my upstairs seats. There was one bar upstairs, which also wasn't overly crowded and very easy to access. Security staff was very friendly and helped us find our seats.
4;I love this place !! We come here all the time for a chill place to smoke hookah at. Me and my friends love it ! Highly recommend it. And the food is great !
2;First off, I got my 5 nights comped. I had to pay the ridiculous resort fee ($24 a night). I m so glad I didn't have to pay more because this place isn't worth anymore. Like all other reviews say, location is fantastic, Employees are friendly, but the hotel is aging. Rooms are dated, and not cleaned thoroughly. We had to move rooms twice because the first two were filthy! In the second room we actually found dog food on the ground. Management said service dogs are allowed in rooms. All in all Harrahs is okay if u get a great deal but don't expect much because you won't get it.
4;I don't think I could add anything that hasn't been said already. The mix of food and beer is perfect here. All the food I've had keeps me coming back for more, and the beer is such a high quality product I just want to drink it everyday. \n\nFour peaks is doing it all right and I don't expect that to change anytime soon.
4;"My favorite Vegas haircut joint. Quick, cheap, high quality place. Service is great; I've visited this place countless times and have been charmed every time. \nThanks, Great Clips, for many fast, fabulous haircuts!"
4;A great, and affordable, way to see the city the way the locals do.  Montreal has to be the most bike-friendly city I've ever been to.  Plus, you can work off all that sandwich you ate at Schwartz's!\n\nYou may need a local to show you around a bit the first time or two.  Remember to give the bike you want a once-over before taking it out of the rack.\n\nIf you have a smartphone, I would highly recommend getting an app that shows all the BIXI stations on a map.  There are even ones that will show you how full/empty stations are.... which is extremely helpful at times.\n\nHighly recommend!
0;"Where to start...  First trip to the Elara since we bought it a year and a half ago.  We were \""greeted\"" between check in and heading to our rooms for the \""onwer's update\"", code for sell up.  We declined preferring instead to settle in and finally see what we had purchased.  \n\nWe stayed four days three nights, apparently just short of qualifying for maid service, who knew?  When I called the front desk to inquire why this resort was the first I have ever seen without such service I was advised to read my contract.  Towels were later sent to my room and left in a pile on the sink with a small trash bag with soap and shampoo.\n\nI had to have the clogged drain in the bathroom repaired, the tub leaked onto the floor and into the livingroom, the dresser drawer stuck, some lights didn't work, the front door would not lock as you left the room unless you remembered to pull it hard, and still the red light on my phone flashed to remind me that I had free gifts awaiting me for just one hour of my time.\n\nAfter the second day, the rude, couldn't care less attitude from the staff, and all of the above, I decided to have that meeting and discuss things.  \n\nThe lady was of course very nice, big smile, eager to help and certainly sell me something.  Free tickets to shows, dining out coupons, etc but not to resolve or even explain any of the things that were happening.  I at one point mentioned that we were considering just selling and moving on and she matter of factly said \""You'll get pennies on the dollar\"", might as well stay.  Then wondered if I would like to buy up to a larger unit or additional time.  Really?\n\nSo aside from the list of repairs that I identified, the lack of service and poor attitudes of those employed to help, probably due to being exposed to upsets guests more often then not, we used the facilities to sleep in and that was that.  Our family had a wonderful time in Las Vegas, spent plenty of money although none of it at the Elara, and headed back to reality until next time.\n\nSpeaking of next time, ithe next time I book anything with the Vacation Club I will certainly have a list of qualifications before I book, inspect the room closely upon my arrival, and make absolutely sure that I receive exactly what I paid for, no exceptions, nothing left to pass.  They will earn every dollar that I pay them from this point on.\n\nIn hind sight, should have stayed with Marriott.  At least there a vacation is a vacation and not a business trip that only they can benefit from."
0;Not for vegetarians. Had the mushroom burger, which is a giant mushroom cap on a bun. It was under cooked (cold) and soggy (weird) the taste badly over powered the topping and the bun. Will never go back.
1;I ordered the two meat plate, brisket and pulled pork, the pork was a low average and the two SMALL slices of Dry Brisket really Sucked.\n\nMy wife ordered the smoked turkey, it was a Processed Turkey Roll that was also dry.\n\nThat was my second time at this Dickeys and was Definitely the last.\n\nIf you want Texas barbecue this is NOT it!
0;Opens late. Long lines. Under staffed. Packages never available for pick up when slip states. Packages sit at local sorting facility for days on end without being delivered. My experience with this post office feels like an insight into living in communist Russia in the 80s
0;Usually service and food are very good. This morning they were a little crowded and no room for 3. We said we would wait outside for a table. They sat 2 other groups. We went back inside and there was no room. We said we were going elsewhere as it was appearant they were not interested in our business. Denny's sat us right away and the food was better anyway.
0;Sorry for my comment tonight. I'm speaking from my personal experience only. \nHaving been here for quite a few months. Came back from oversea This afternoon. They normally has special price on drinks & appetizers every last Tuesday night with dancing party. I did receive a email about that special sometime last week.  I went there with my partner thinking they  had the discount. However, when I asked the waiter if they have special discount, he said he would ask the manager without telling us clearly. Therefore, I thought I was going to order some appetizers before we order entree. Nevertheless, we decided just to order three appetizers and two house red wine.\nI was thinking if there were special price, I could order something that was on regular price to balance off their special discount because I'm also a business person, didn't want to take every advantage. I asked if they have Bordeaux as commonly known red wine but the waiter brought me white wine.  He came back said they  did not have Bordeaux so I asked for Pinot noir and a dessert.\nAs a result, our bill was $88.- . I even found that two wines cost $27.- Holly Molly, what?????  then he said they did not have special.  Wooow, if I've to pay that price, I didn't have to sit there where other people coming to dance & took my seat whenever I got up to a dance or to bathroom.  Presentation of food was OK but quality did not match with the price.\nAs I was with a guy friend and didn't want to make him feel bad. I only commented with another friend who went there for the party & a couple of drink only. He said he would never eat there as the food wasn't worth the price. He's right. for half the price, I would take it but not the full price. Or I could have better quality and service. No wonder it was not as crowded as it used to be.\nI felt I had been deceived.  I went home and found the email about the half price of wine and appetizers and special on beer.  I sent them a email with no respond.  Good bye and good luck, cheater  Villa Antonio.
2;Apple Store is now in Arrowhead Mall on the lower floor, not far east of the food court in the middle of the mall.  Pleasant service, and they don't have the traditional checkout lines - instead the employees can ring you up on a little mobile device and email your receipt to you.  Cool.\n\nPricey though.  $30 for a simple jack so I can plug in my iTouch?  Come on.  $35 for flimsy plastic protector?  Come on.
4;Great place.  Owned and run by two sisters who are absolute sweethearts, very friendly and gracious.  And pretty!!  Some very unusual cupcake flavors but all that I've had have been right on the mark.  Full size and mini available and worth every penny.  Interesting drinks, both non-alcoholic and alcoholic.  Try the St Germain Elderflower liqueur.  Very unusual and delicious.  Very friendly staff, too.  Watch cupcakes being made in their glass enclosed kitchen.  Got an idea for a cupcake?  They'll listen.  Nice place to stop for dessert or a little sweet treat.
3;Given the location and the history of this place, you may have really low expectations.  That helps, but the food is actually quite good.  Friday night's ubiquitous fish fry, of course, but they have a respectable menu of Mediterranean specialties as well.  I'm fond of the Shwarma Platter, myself.  Some nights they have belly dancers for entertainment- that's really fun to watch.  \n\nWhat's a trip to a hookah lounge without an actual hookah?  Try the peach/mango, it's amazingly smooth and flavorful.  I'd never tried it before and was amazed at how uncigarette-like it is.
3;Good food, good beer.\n\nThe liter beers are huge, about the size of my head.  You could kill someone w/ the mug, it was so heavy.\n\nWe ordered the chicken bratwurst, veal bratwurst, weiners (kekeke -_-), and pork cutlet entrees along with two pretzel apeptizers - one was some garlic type tip, and the other was chicken liver.  I was surprised the chicken liver didnt taste bad, but I dont think i'd recommend it.  The pretzels were awesome though, with the other dips.  The chicken bratwurst seemed too dense and was really filling - it's like they packed a whole chicken into the two bratwursts.  The weiners were soo good, wish we had some buns to put them in (thats what she said).  But really, we all thought they'd be amazing with buns and ketchup.  The pork cutlet was huge, took up the entire plate and was also really good with the spicy mustard.  All the entrees came w/ a side, like mashed potatoes.  I had the liter hef to drink (it was great), and i was surprised i left standing (lightweight, i know O_o).  All the entrees are large portions, so you'll definitely leave feeling full.\n\nThe dining area was cool, felt kind of like a cafeteria.  We came around 2pm so there weren't that many people there, but I bet it would be so fun eating and drinking there when its packed, with live music going on.\n\nNext time I come i want to try some of their fish specials, but being my first time there, it just didn't sound right not getting bratwurst.\n\nThe service was great, really attentive and gave us recommendations on what people liked.  The manager also said it was cool for us to leave the car parked in their private lot and walk across the street to the hard rock too.\n\nI'll be back.
4;I went once, and I was hooked. So Hooked that I tried to go back the same night but was unable to because I didnt want to miss the tram that would take me back to my hotel room in Palazzo. :(  But I did get to go again at the end of our trip.. and guess what I got the same sandwich.\n\nNow I got to try the Hawaiian which was tasty and delicious. I also tried the Caribbean Chicken or some other name.. and that was also good but my favorite by far was the Caprese, so much that I ordered it twice. The cheese tasted freshly cut, the basil was just right and tomato crisp inside a bun that was well pressed so it had that right crispy outside and the soft inside. The balsamic vinaigrette just made my mouth water for more. I wish I was back in vegas so I could walk to it and order another caprese sandwich. sigh. Earl of Sandwich please come to socal!\n\nThe lines can get long if you are here on peak time. However, it is open 24/7 so come later if you can! :-D
4;This place truly defines what a family pizza place should be like.  They use fresh ingredients and make a damn good pizza.  To start with we got the garlic bread which was unlike anything I have ever had before.  It comes with a sauce and a salad, both blew me away.\n\nFor the pizza we spit it half spicy cheese and half a veg.  It was awesome.  Even the crust and dough that they use has a particular flavor that remided me of the pizza we had in NYC.  The best thing was you could tell that the ingredients were fresh with basil, tomatoes, and sauce that was nothing like I have had in the past.  \n\nIf we are ever in the area we will definitely be back.  They also have a good beer and wine section.
2;We were scheduled to stay here for 2 nights, but had to leave after one. The public bathrooms (near the pool) were very dirty, as was the elevators. I lost confidence in the cleanliness of my room before I even saw it. But, it was clean. The problem is with the mattresses, very very uncomfortable. When I notified Hilton customer service, they took notes on all my complaints and I received a note from the manager. She explained there was a convention of teens, who were not staying at the hotel, that made such a mess of the public areas. She also explained that they are planning on replacing the queen beds by the end of this year. That is why I gave them 3 stars. I was glad the manager took my concerns to heart.
1;If you are a big fan of Monta or Ramen Sora, this place doesn't quite meet your expectations. Everything from the food to service was average or needed a lot of work. Needless to say, if you live on the east side of town I definitely respect the practicality of frequenting this place to have your ramen fix, but I'd say the trip to Monta or Ramen Sora will be worth it in the end.
2;We ordered a red pie with mushroom, jalapenos and pepperoni and a garlic sauce. It wasn't bad or outstanding. For some reason the second slice was tastier than the first which didn't make any sense. We thought perhaps the pizza soaked up the garlicness giving more flavor? They should just serve some sort of dipping sauce with their pizza because although the crust had a nice crisp, it was about as plain as the body of Christ you can get from church any Sunday.  \n\ni do like going to Revolution because they do have a pretty good beer selection. Unfortunately, on our last visit they seemed to be in the middle of changing their beer choices so it was hit or miss ordering off the beer menu. i believe on Friday they have $3 NC draught beers.  It'll be interesting to see how they hold up when a beer specific place (Growlers) opens up down the way. \n\nAlso of note, they have a pretty nice outdoor seating area. My only wish would be that the outdoor seating be a little higher so i could easily look over the wall to watch the people on the street without having to use perfect posture sitting straight up. \n\nWe did order gelato on a previous visit and when the wife doesn't seem interested in getting it again, it must not have been too outstanding. The appetizer menu sounded unappetizing to me: mussels, calamari, collards and pork.  i suppose i might like the toasted ravioli and the flat bread, but they didn't sound worth \n7 bucks. \nThe service has always been good to us. i imagine we'll be back because there's something i just like about this place (the name, outdoor seating and beer) and at the moment, it is the best place in NoDa for some good brew.
4;i love you gucci. i love this gucci extra bc the whole Crystals shopping plaza smells so freaking good when you walk inside. how do they filter the air and keep it smelling that??? i have no idea. maybe that's what real money smells like. haha.\n\nanyway this gucci was awesome. i was greeted right when i walked in by everyone who passed by, not just people in their respective zones. the associates allowed us to browse without being pushy and they retrieved all the items we wanted to see without sighing or rolling their eyes. i appreciate this a lot especially in a town where there are high rollers and these associates are probably looking to make a killing off of their commission. In any case, the way they treated me and my friends was excellent. kudos to you gucci. \n\nmy friends and i walked out very happy with our purchases. i love impulse shopping!
3;I like this store. They are knowledgable and friendly.
4;When I went to wildflower this time, I decided to branch out and try something different from my norm. I got the chicken Parmesan sandwich and holy God above it was good. I also got a slice of the chocolate cake. If you are a chocolate lover, a hormonal woman, or some combo of the two, you HAVE to try this cake. It is dark and smooth and sooooo good. \nWildflower has yet to disappoint me... Every time I come here, it is such a great experience.
4;I was worry about bad review but , general manager : Walter  ( very nice looking guy) he was so big hearted and helped me what I needed! And Alberto was try hard for me. He was kind too! I appreciated both! And didn't wait much great price and nice car ill rent Fox again!!!! Walter look like Denzel Washington ! He was such a sweet heart!!!! Thank you!!!
3;Didn't know what we wanted for dinner, came across this so we gave it a chance. The food was delicious, one of the best easy fast foodish teriyaki place I've had...will def come back again!
4;This review is mainly for the bar. We ate in the restaurant on Christmas Day a few years ago (Swan Court) & had an excellent tasting menu dinner. But it is the bar we consistently return to time and time again.\n\nFirst off, the bartenders are terrific - friendly and knowledgeable. We always sit at the bar (rather one of the tables) as we enjoy chatting with the bartenders. We look forward to seeing Dave each Christmas visit (we miss his fellow bartender David, who moved out of state).\n\nThe bar menu is delicious - sliders and French Onion soup (made with four gras) are highlights, but we usually order a few items off the dining room a la carte menu as well.\n\nDrinks are always stellar, and often when chatting with the bartenders about various liquors, we are offered a free taste or two of this or that. I'll never forget the taste of 1972 Pedro Jimenez that we were given a few years ago - a rarity that is now nearly impossible to find.\n\nThis isn't one of those raucous Vegas nightclubs, but a nice cozy bar where you can relax and enjoy good drinks, good food, and good conversation.
4;The wife and I were looking for a new spot to eat for lunch. We have heard about the upcoming Mochiko Chicken concept opening soon so we went on the second day they opened. We were not disappointed, as the service has a very personal touch. The chicken tenders are the best you can buy- nothing like it anywhere else! (we tried raising kanes and they are dry and flavorless). Lychee lemonade is very tasty (although I felt that it could use lemon). The chicken is so good, however, I felt that there should be a bone-in option as well. In the end, I note a few things. The place is small, but gives you the feeling that they will go above and beyond for a guest. Friendly staff and owner is clearly a big part of daily operation. I was lucky enough to be waited on by the owner (Jerry) and he was anxious and more than helpful with all of our questions. I strongly recommend trying Mochiko, you will not be disappointed- Oh and pro-tip: ask for a sunny up egg on your rice bowl/ ENJOY!
4;Every time I'm in Vegas I end up spending the afternoon on the patio here resolving my hangover... You can't beat the view - the Bellagio fountains are immediately across the street.   \n\nEverything I've ever eaten here has been fabulous, from the atypical fish and chips to the mussels to the croque monsieur to the french onion soup. Full bar, wine, beer, etc. Great Frangria (their version of Sangria) - buy a carafe to get a better deal... Excellent people watching on the strip. The Atrium room is also a very nice place to sit, but I'd avoid the rest of the place as it is very dark. They've just added a bunch of gas heaters on the patio, so there are no excuses not to enjoy the patio, even on the cooler nights.
0;yes it's in a casino, and yes it's ridiculously overpriced. but even if they had normal chinatown pricing, i wouldn't bother coming back here. with strip chinese joints, you're paying primarily for the location, but it's usually also about the food quality, presentation, and service. unfortunately, that's not the case at Zine - here, all you're paying for is location.\n\ni've been here a handful of times, mostly just for the noodle soups. which were ok. today was my first time having their entrees, and i wasn't impressed with anything we had. it was probably the worst bbq duck and pork i've ever had - tasteless, gristly, just yuck.... \n\nas others have mentioned, serving size is smaller than most places - maybe 3/4 of the portion you would normally get. factor that in if you're doing family style, and just fyi this is what you get for $600 at Zine (seriously):\n\n12 veggie spring rolls, 4x beef chow fun, 4x fried rice, 4x bbq combo, 3x steamed veg, 2x kung pao chicken, 3x lemon chicken, 3x honey walnut shrimp. bbq combo is $30 for awful bbq - 1/4 duck, 1/4 chicken and maybe 1/4lb bbq pork. $25 for an order of lemon chicken, which is literally 1 piece of chicken katsu w/ some lemon sauce. \n\neven if you gamble here and can get a comp - take your casino cash and get your moneys worth somewhere else at palazzo. there are so many other worthwhile overpriced places to choose from.
0;"Went to Vegas for a girls weekend & wanted to find an affordable hotel (not something super, dirt cheap...but something under $300 for the weekend). I will never go back to this hotel.. I would much rather pay more than have to deal with this dirty hotel again. \n\nHere's why....\n\n1. No full length mirrors in the rooms. I MEAN- really? Obviously if youre going to vegas, youre most likely getting dressed up & going out. But if you plan on staying here, plan on not knowing what you look like when you walk out of your room.\n\n2. The lighting in the bathroom is TERRIBLE. If you're a girl & you are getting ready in the bathroom- Please be advised....the lighting makes you look like shit no matter how hot you are. \n\n3. We asked for towels & it took AN HOUR for them to bring it up. This happened not once but twice- and when we complained, the lady on the phone said \""You know, he's got a lot of rooms to go to he will be there as soon as he can.\"" Sorry- I wasn't aware they only had 1 guy delivering towels to the entire hotel. \n\n4. The hallways are dirty & dark. The carpets are disgusting, and the walls are DIRTY. I felt like I was walking down the hallways of a dirty motel. I mean really, can  you add some lights? \n\n5. The housekeeping ladies literally opened the door to our room 5 times throughout the trip for NO REASON. We even had our privacy sign up, they would just open the door and then close it at will. SHADY.\n\n6. Valet parking was full ALL weekend. How does that even happen? It didnt matter what time of day it was. It was full, and we had to park in self parking which was also full except for the top level at the way back. \n\nThe third night we were there we ended up getting a room at the Hard Rock instead and let me tell you - it didnt even compare. \n\nLesson: Don't stay at Luxor. Ever. Just not worth it."
4;The box is THE place to go 4 an excellent, top it yourself (which I like) perfectly cooked burger....I usually have the big one. If you're really hungry go 4 the double. Excellent rings 2. Word of warning though....PAY ATTENTION here folks...NO AC...if you're not a local, this is NOT the place 4 u after May 1st, got it....the rest of us don't wanna hear u crying in July!!!!
1;Wanted to love this place.... Fast, close to home, and great Yelp reviews.  Alas, it was not to be...\nGot the Red Curry lunch with veggies, tofu, and brown rice. They had a great variety of veggies and they were cooked perfectly. Not limp, crispy without being too raw. Brown rice was perfectly cooked as well. Trouble was the curry. There was a layer of sauce on the veggies, as opposed to it swimming in curry. Which would have been fine except that there was a gritty texture, no silky coconut milk, no hint of fish sauce, and NO FLAVOR. There was not even a hint of heat, nor any other discernible spice notes. When has a curry ever been bland? I'm the wrong person to ask. I guess.\nI also tried the chicken pot stickers. They wrappers had a weird texture, the filling was super bland, and the sauce they came with was just thin, sweet, and totally forgettable. \n\nDecor was inviting, it seemed clean, and the staff seemed fine (ordered carry out, my order was waiting for me when I got there, both the guy on the phone and the gal on the register seemed competent & friendly-ish)...\nI may be back the next time my son bugs me for Pei Wei. :)
4;Visiting from Hawaii.\n\nNothing super fancy, but the food was better than anticipated (based in previous reviews) and the service was very attentive. \n\nWe ordered the variety appetizer, which was amazing! It arrived with two ham/pork and cheese type sandwiches, fried bananas, sirloin steak, skirt steak and Moros y cristianos. My husband and I enjoyed all the flavors though we had to do take-out because we were so stuffed. \n\nWe would definitely return to this restaurant.
4;I recently visited Optical Gallery for new contact lenses and glasses.  I have a tricky stigmatism that has always been difficult to work with for other optometrists, but the Dr. was able to get the right glasses and contact lenses that work for me. I purchased two new sets of frames after three years with my old glasses, but I had trouble adjusting to the new prescription, and I ended up needing an adjustment to my prescription and new lenses. They had both frames fixed quickly with no questions asked.  I always know when a company has great service when they are willing to help solve my problems without giving me grief.  Also, the sales rep that helped me picked out some great frames that I get compliments on all the time!
1;"Perhaps it's Superbowl weekend that made Boa seem sub par, or maybe it was the fact that you can only get happy hour prices at the bar, or even the way the bartender was more concerned about setting the Tivo to record some T.V. show, instead of serving us our last happy hour drink, I just don't know. Either way I am not impressed at all with Cafe Boa. For one, the entire restaurant  was reserved until 9:30pm, Ok, so let's sit outside you say. Ahhh but low and behold you cannot get happy hour prices outside. Would this be so bad if the bar wasn't 10 ft by 10ft....probably not. So the happy hour \""area\"" is small but luckily we were able to find a seat at the bar. Now the prices are good, and they offer a decent amount of drink specials on everything from wine to beer, to martinis, however the food is limited. I though the Pinot Noir I ordered (half off) was very dry for a Pinot. The food specials and sausage dish served in a marinara sauce was ok, the sauce was interesting with capers and black olives. It did give me some new ideas to experiment with, when I make my sauce.  Unfortunately the sausage was dry like the Pinot. (good pairing) My date ordered a cappretta salad, which was several tomatoes and some mozzarella and this cool soft cheese. Or \""badass\"" as our bartender described it. LOL!  That was very good, but it was an extremely small portion.  Overall the service was decent. I heard the energetic, charismatic bartender, drop several F bombs, and the staff seemed somewhat \""wired\"" like someone left a big basket of easter candy in the back, and they all got into it. Sugar rushes aside, overall the final bill tallied up to 30$ (without tip) for 4 glasses of wine, and 2 apps. Not bad you say? Since we missed one happy hour drink, the bartender was cool enough to leave one of our drinks off the tab, to balance it out. As he said \""It was both our faults we missed that deadline\"" with a smile. I jokingly replied, \""actually I just blame you.\"" I was kidding, but also somewhat serious as he spent about 10 minutes trying to figure out the Tivo settings. Um, who has TIvo in a bar anyway?"
3;"First, let me just say that I've never been to the South so I can't really compare this food to the true Southern style. I'm only comparing it to the other restaurants here in Vegas.\n\nWent there on a weekend for dinner around their opening time (5pm), there was only 2 tables in there. So we got seated right the way.\n\nThey bring you a basket of hush puppies right the way with sweet butter.... oh my...... move over the \""Hush Puppies\"" restaurant... these are the best hush puppies I've had. They are not your typical fried corn meal batter. These are really flavorful and fill with some kind of stuffing and Jalapeno peppers. Nice intense flavor with a hint of spiciness. We had to get a refill of one more basket.\n\nFor starters we ordered Grilled Cajun Scallops as appetizer $10.29. They were really fresh and skewered with some vegetables and over some rice. But the Cajun flavor could be strong though. \n\nFor entrees we ordered the all you can eat fried catfish fillets for $13.95 and Jambalaya for $14.29\n\nThe fried catfish were really tasty, the batter was seasoned just right so it's very crispy and flavorful. And these fillets are big pieces, and it's a real piece of fillet, not the fake small pieces other restaurants usually serve. And it's all-you-can-eat.... for $13.95! Can't beat that. They will bring you two more pieces each time when you get a refill and it's really fast. I think catfish is one of their popular items so they always have fresh batch coming out.\n\nThe Jambalaya was OK, the Cajun flavor was not as strong on this. And not really spicy. Maybe that's why the have a bottle of Louisiana's Hot Sauce on each of the tables.\n\nReally attentive and excellent service. The atmosphere is romantic and quiet.  They also have a bar on the other side. But if you want to enjoy a romantic atmosphere, sit on the restaurant side. They also have a balcony upstairs and it appears to be another bar/ party room with a stage. It was closed when we were there, but maybe you can book it for private parties."
3;This is one of the nicer, large bowling alleys in town and is my preferred. I don't bowl often, I'm not even that great at it, but sometimes it's a fun thing to do among friends. \n\nAdd that it's in Red Rock Casino where there's plenty else to do, you can fill up your whole day just hanging out here. I would say bowl and hit up happy hour, watch a movie or a concert at the pool if you're ambitious. \n\nTo sweeten the deal, there's special late night bowling pricing. $1.50 per game starting at 10 PM until 2AM on Sunday through Thursday. If you watch a movie, bring your ticket stub and get one game for free. Shoe rentals are not included in that. \n\nThere's a bar in here with pool tables and darts as well if you're into that. There's also cafe serves snacks like pizza if you want to eat and bowl. If you ever have a special event, their VIP private bowling rooms are awesome and worth considering!
1;I have to update this review by adding one more star only due to the fact that the establishment's owner and manager have contacted me in an effort to better my experience in the restaurant on my next visit.  Although I will more than likely not come back to this place because I don't live in Charlotte and was only there for work, this fact alone is deserving of an uptick in rating.  Customer care matters.  Thanks guys.
4;"Some rental car company complaints amuse me (and many don't). I think part of the behavior of rental car company is that they are handing the keys to a $30,000 vehicle (give or take) to someone they barely know (again, give or take), and the driver will probably abuse the car because it's \""not theirs\"", so I take no offense against a counterling who once again reviews insurance issues and wants me to sign-off on decline additional coverage.  Fortunately, I haven't had to deal with a real problem.  Part of that is luck, and I've read true horror stories.  This time, lucky again.\n\nBudget did a great job.  No complaints.  Fast (as can be expected -- it's never fast if you go to the counter), pleasant, competent service.  A great car and a reasonable price.  Fast return.  Considering this a rental car company, it's as good as it gets.  Yes, I can fantasize better service: I get a big hug as I walk in, some old guy immediately tosses me the keys to a corvette and says, \""bring it back empty, and don't worry about a crumpled fender\"".  But since I'm renting a car in the real world, not an imaginary one, world, this was as good as it gets."
1;My friend wanted to try this place so we came for breakfast one morning. The hot cocoa was delish! Looked more like a dessert. I had the tamale and eggs breakfast. It wasn't that great. I should have ordered the blueberry pancakes which I first chose but then changed my mind. Sorry, cant remember what my friend ordered but she wasn't too impressed with whatever she had. Her daughter had the french toast which looked really good and a huge portion. She liked it. I should have stolen a piece to try it. Oh well. I'll pass on coming back here unless I feel like some of that hot cocoa!
4;Did a tour with them, fantastic facility, with very knowledgeable trainers who walked us around.. Tour was about an hour or so, watches them give their lions a bath which was cool and a training session which was neat... Can't wait to go back again and see more
4;These guys do a great job. I've looked everywhere for a drive thru wash with soft pads so it doesn't scratch my paint..drive thrus r harsh on black..and not only does this place have it but the guys come out and give ur car a pre hand scrubbed wash down..legit..$5-7 can't beat it. Both me and my fiance come here..both black sports cars and never worry about scratches. :)
3;Hushpuppies? Aren't those shoes for the elder crowd? \nBrunswick Stew? Isn't that a soup served up in a Canadian Province? \nSmoking while dining? Oh yeah, this is a tobacco state. \n\nListen, I'm just a guy from San Francisco, you know, the land of foie gras, locally grown organically produce, the slow cooking movement, I didn't really know a lick about Southern cooking ... until last night. \n\nSure, it was all fried and oozy and a week on the treadmill still won't burn off the number of calories from just a single serving of sweet tea, but now I understand why Charlotte is ranked 34 out of 45 on the American Fitness Index, a ranking of the 50 most populous cities that determined the least fit cities. Fried, fried and fried goodness sums up the local goodies available at The Penguin, such as the salty fried pickles, a huge batch of perfectly battered slices served with MSG laden ranch dressing. Hushpuppies, while a crowd pleaser, were a little lost on me, although I'm sure the same can be said about California politics to those from this part of the country. \n\nI also indulged in a wonderfully battered corn dog and a Southern Burger, slathered with coleslaw. \n\nMy biggest impression was not the interesting mix of clientele, very typical of some of the districts of San Francisco, but the prices. At these rates, we would have ordered the entire menu for what an entree costs at a typical resto back home. As one of my dining partners said, if you become homeless, this is the place to be.
1;Oh No, the first Cirque to suck!  If you've never seen Cirque, then see this one first, you won't be disappointed.  If you've seen others or if you're like me, seen ALL of them in Vegas, Orlando and San Francisco, then you'll be so bored you'll be tempted to ask for your money back and write to corporate cirque, demanding a refund and an apology for tricking a loyal fan into seeing a rehash of the hohum moments taken from other cirques.
1;"Outdated and dirty, TI feels like a legendary Vegas casino minus the charm and updates necessary to keep it from becoming a Sahara or Taj Mahal.\n\nThe only redeeming quality about TI is it's location on the strip, and for that reason only is TI worth a night stay. You can see the entire strip and \""free shows\"" all the way to Mandalay Bay from some of the rooms and the views are amazing at nighttime. Walking to other grander casinos and nightclubs from TI is a breeze.\n\nAside from location, TI is extremely underwhelming. The staff is very nice and accomodating, particularly at the check-in/check-out desks, but I have never seen a check in line move so slowly. It was pretty painful. The casino itself is run down, for instance some of the buttons in the elevator were so worn you'd have too look at the surrounding numbers to know what they are. Also, there is a complete lack of fine dining and night life options. There's a western bar there and a terrible Kahunaville (see my review) that are meant for good times for adults, but they are both gimmicky and nonmemorable, so again the proximity to the other casinos is hugely needed.\n\nFinally, the rooms have been updated and are more modern but in my experience they are not maintained well. The sun shining into our room cast a light on the furniture that displayed dust laden everywhere, and there were some rust stains in the bathroom.\n\nWe will not choose TI again. There are two other more affordable casinos that meet our marks, and plenty more moderately priced ones that exceed our expectations every time. I think TI could turn things around easily, and I hope they do before the bulldozer comes..."
3;10 stars for the cocktails \n\n2 stars for the food.\n\nAbsolutely the best place in Madison for creative old school and new school drinks.  Bartenders always remember your name and make you feel welcome. \n\nUnfortunately the food falls on its face here.  Beyond the grilled cheese it just is bland.
1;Lots of construction.  Expect jackhammering all night.  The staff was so great!!!.....they offered us earplugs as a solution.  Perhaps if we had booked the place at a discounted rate knowing what we were getting in to we would not have been disappointed.\n\nAlso the new Delano rooms are hospital white.  Not a dollop of color anywhere.  Insane asylum sterile feeling.  Lost is the upscale elegance as these new rooms combine brass with chrome and white!!  \n\nWEIRD
4;This place is the best
4;I love this market! Right in the middle of OldTown - it is perfectly located for locals!\nThere are many pre-made items here and it is a great place to go for lunch and roam around and check everything out.\nMy favorite stand is in the middle aisle and the man who is a French Chef. He is always offering tasting of his Creme Brulee and his Chicken Salad is THE BOMB\n\nI often also go to a great stand where she sells fresh ceviche. It's perfect! I love stopping through the farmers market to get a lil something for lunch over the weekends.
3;La place est id\u00e9ale pour passer l'apr\u00e8s midi tranquille \u00e0 \u00e9tudier. Les latt\u00e9s sont excellents!
4;My experience with Freeman Painting was professioanl and pleasant, from beginning to end.  Ron showed up for a quote when he said he would, and gave me a very reasonable price.  I was also impressed that his profesional crew had been with him 10 years, and they had known each other for 15 years.  He also had all the required insurance and licenses to do business.\nI wanted the ceilings and walls painted in our three story townhouse and was concerned about the heights (14 feet) and the potential mess.  The crew came in and taped everything off, and covered everything with plastic.  The entire job was done spraying.  They were done in two days, the plastic and tape was removed and there was very little mess to clean after.  Ron and his crew walked through and touched up any areas that needed it, and made sure I was happy with the work before even asking for payment.\nA great experience!  You can't go wrong with Freeman Painting!
0;Restaurant review\nI don't know why this place has gotten such high reviews, but my meal went south very quickly. Some tips, there is NO FREE soup any longer. When you go order they placed it through an ipad. One of the questions is whether to tip 15-25%. Just click no. This is a self serve restaurant from picking up your food to depositing your tray. There is no reason to tip and this just by default. I was craving some other korean dish which was not available here. I went to the kalbi, unfortunately I made the mistake of ordering one that was a stir fry version of kalbi. There was vegetables and it was a soaking mess. I have no idea were my dish went wrong. Small amount of beef, lots of vegetables. Tables are very cramped and the prices are not cheap. My kalbi dish cost 12+ dollars. Overall a big let down, this is a big step below K-bowl which is leading my Korean food experience in champaign.\n\nPros: Unlimited rice\n\nCons: Expensive for the quality of food, small spaces, sub-par food\n\nHidden deals:\nMake sure you don't hit the tip button. This is a SELF-SERVE restaurant
1;I was pretty excited to fund out the Rio had a hash house a go go. I've been to the one in San Diego was and was blown away by how amazing it was. The portions were huge and the food tasted great. This one however brings shame to the hash house name. \n\nFirst off the ambiance of the restaurant is fine. A standard restaurant located in a casino at the Rio. The service here was also decent...no complaints there. The food however was disappointing to say the least. I ordered the corn beef hash which was moderately priced for Vegas food. The plate came out with an unpleasant liquid along the bottom of it and it just got soaked into the potatoes. The corn beef had as much flavor as a piece of cotton. It was terrible. By far the worst corn beef I've ever had. The biscuits looked appetizing. But again....WRONG...DRYEST BUSCUIT EVER and just not enjoyable at all. \n\nI still love the one in SD. But never coming back to this one. For sure.
1;Friendly service, but food tasteless. No dressing on coleslaw, tasteless spinach, even after redoing.
0;"One star because zero isn't an option. I ordered a beer I've had multiple times elsewhere. Beer came out and tasted off - it was clear the draft lines were dirty. I asked the waitress if they had other options in the same style and she offered to replace the beer. When she set down the beer I was told I \""owed $5\"" and that her manager Jimmy was making her collect. Please don't offer to \""replace\"" by selling me another beer... I went to speak to Jimmy the manager and was told he would call the police if I didn't pay $5. Paul's has the most unprofessional management I've ever witnessed and I will never return."
2;Place is small, so friend and I ordered take-out. We tried the chicken kebab and the kofta kebab. It came with lots of rice, salad, grilled tomatoes and peppers. Taste was alright. Portion would definitely fill you up.
0;"I bought a Deal Chicken in November and called to make an appointment at the end of December if memory serves me correctly for the Gel manicure and Paraffin pedicure.  Gary told me the first available appointment was April !!!  I was so surprised, but he said I would understand why when I came to the unique salon.  Okay!  A few weeks ago, Gary called me to confirm.  And today, he called to confirm again for the appointment tomorrow. I missed the call and he left four important things to remember...including they do not remove gel, that has to be done beforehand.  Keep in mind, the Deal Chicken was for a GEL manicure.  I called him back immediately and said I do have gel on my nails; he said I would have to remove it beforehand and \""It's so bad for your nails.\""  All of this information was said in an arrogant tone.  I told him to forget it, that I was not going to get the acetone he suggested and take it off myself.  I said I would contact Deal Chicken and get my money back.  At that point, he told me I could not get my money back since I was canceling inside the 48-hour window.  When I pointed out to him that in our two previous conversations, he had not mentioned that he doesn't take off gel, he hung up on me!!!!\nI don't know what kind of \""artist\"" Gary thinks he is, but he needs a new profession --- one where he does not interact with people.\n\nWow I can't believe at 8:30 in the morning, I have been hung up on.  He won't be ruining my day!  But don't be taken in by this place's \""good\"" deals!"
1;Ok so after going here a few times, the owner is very short with me. he hurt me bad, ripped off one of my thumb nails, told me that i couldn't just get a pink and white fill i had to take them off and pay 50 for a full set of glitter tips with acrylic on them. COMMON you know thats messed up. go to other places, for nails. pedicures are spot on. ask for jenny.
1;I hated this place pretty much from the very beginning. It was very busy and not enough staff, apparently. It's a room with nothing on the walls or floors to absorb the sound so it's very loud. After we were seated it took nearly 5 minutes for the server just to get to the table. \n\nThe menu is limited in that they are all about that meat and potatoes thing with very few alternative options: no meatless, vegetarian, or gluten free items. \n\nI opted for a bowl of steel cut oats topped with strawberries & pecans and it was ok. Certainly nothing special about a bowl of oatmeal so I'm not even sure what I expected here. No PB and most have never heard of putting it in your oatmeal. But if you don't, all you get is a bowl of carbs for breakfast\n\nDo they even know what bill time is? In all the time I've been eating out I have never had any restaurant not give me a credit card receipt. It is not your position to assume I don't want one and I should never have to ask for it. Always get a credit card receipt to help prevent fraud. \n\nNot going back here. The end.
2;For the price you had to pay to get in, and the amount of time you have to wait in line, you would expect food that is really really delicious.\n\nThe service is really nice here, people are friendly and come by you relatively quickly despite the size, so that's a plus.\n\nThe food is really mediocre though. I tried a lot of the the food, and I was not too thrilled about the taste.  Some of the food that was tasty was: kimchi, steak, the ice cream, pasta, sliders, and pizza. A lot of the other foods were not too great...\n\nI would really advise you to try somewhere else instead of spending a lot of money here. If you want to eat at a buffet, there's Rock and Roll sushi, and a Korean BBQ (both all you can eat) about a minute down from Wynn hotel. \n\nSave your money, and try somewhere else rather than waste money on this place.
4;"Bought the Living Socials discount coupon.\nMy dog seems to like it here, she is happy when I leave her and happy when I pick her up.\nDawn is very nice and professional and I believe truly cares for our furry friends.\nI like the fact that they are not crated all day like some if the other dog day cares around town.\nI'm so happy that they have opened a new location in the \""true\"" Northwest part of town. (next to Vons and Target)."
3;I like this place, it's so convenient because its so close to my house, the problem is that lately it gets so crowded you have to wait hours to get seated,and they don't take reservations, I like the pastry basket and the cheese , I ate the chilaquiles and they were really good not that spicy, my husband ordered chicken and waffles and they were not bad but not good either.\n\nI like that they have a small patio and decor is my  favorite, definitely coming back , if I can get a table of course!
0;I am not sure when they actually open but the sign was flashing open so we went in and it was a ghost town.  After standing there and moving the tables around to fit our family still nobody has greeted us or said I will be right with you.  The phone rang and we finally saw the first sign of life but still no acknowledgement to us standing in the restaurant.  So we decided to leave for a different place and I guess that jolted him into almost chasing us out of the store yelling for us to come back because he was really open.  I guess get there when you know people are already in there eating.
4;A great indoor place to bring the kids for something fun to do.  Highly recommend!
0;"Service sucks! Bar area is a smoke filled room with worse service then the food area...what a let down. Great location for something good. Just NOT THIS. Ugh...hoping for a good place to open in this area soon. FINISHING my review 8-29-2013 I went back cause a friend said his buddy runs the place. MISTAKE AGAIN. I WILL NOT RETURN. POOR POOR BAR SERVICE & \""dining area\"" haha more like a middle school lunch room. They really need to get rid of the front area where YOU STAND and wait to order.They should put tables in and hire actual wait staff!"
1;I really like the atmosphere at get nailed and the hours 24/7 BUT after my last few experiences here I will not be returning unless everyone else is closed and I have no other option the time before this last I got a new set 2 had to be fixed before I left then a week later had to come and get a fill early cause they were so bad then came back for a late night fill and pedicure ended up needing a new set my other set only 3 weeks old when she was taking them of split my thumb nail started bleeding hurt so bad then had to redo my polish cause she didn't pick out the right base then I'm like pedicure time burns the shit out of my leg when trying to rinse the scrub off then trying to tell me what I want won't look good....... well unless you must go try somewhere else..
3;Had fun here, got a little crazy here with friends. Good crowd. Just hoping no one took pictures.
1;I really like this Loews, especially since my more local option is the disgusting Southland 9. But this theater has a lot of problems.\n\nThough this complaint only applies to a small window of time, I have to say that seeing a movie at this theater on a holiday is an absolute nightmare. My family goes to a movie on Christmas night every year. Two years ago, we went to see a family film (there was a then-seven year old, my niece, in our party). Throughout the entire movie there were screaming, unattended children running around the back of the theater, cursing and hitting each other. No one from the staff or management made any attempt to address this issue, though a few customers went to complain.\n\nThe real kicker was that as we were leaving the theater, a swarm of kids was running around outside our theater to the point that people had to dodge them and make strategic plans to run out of the building. They were screaming, jumping on each other, and fighting. We were parked near the front entrance and needed to stop at the restrooms for the 7 year old, so we started to head out in that direction. Security (who was finally showing up for the first time all night!) stopped us and told us that we COULD NOT go this way. The 7 year old started to cry because she had to use the restroom so badly, and my sister had to argue with a cop to let them through. It was an absolutely atrocious experience, and one that I won't forget.\n\nThe good news is that I've heard that, after many complaints and a shooting, this Loews has stepped up their security. Last night I noticed a sign saying that unaccompanied minors would not be allowed at the theater after 5PM on Christmas night. Hopefully this year will be a little more pleasant.
4;My kitchen drain was stopped up and I called and within a half and hour Ron came and fixed it. VERY polite and prompt. no problems with this company.
4;3 time repeat customer here and zero complaints!  We own 3 volvos currently and have always had an excellent experience.  The sales department has always been very fair, prompt and upfront.  The services department goes out of there way even staying after hours to see our need are met.  Keep in mind these folks are not magicians but do evrything in their power to see our cars are fixed properly, on time and with minimal impact to our busy schedules.
4;Amazing. We were seated in a timely manner considering the lunch crowd, and the waiter were always available. The food was Amazing!!! Mind blowing and you can taste the quality of ingredients. The atmosphere is relaxing and entertaining and it was a beautiful day out. Even if its seasonal im definetly waiting and going next summer and telling everyone i know to go as well!
2;Following the rave reviews on here, I ordered the Paradise, Phoenix, and Tuna Tartare for take out, and was underwhelmed. While, in theory, the combinations sounded delicious, the taste was lacking. I don't know why, but everything tasted boring. 2 of the sauces were too strong for my tastes, so I left them aside, which left the rolls bland. I found the prices too high as well, for what I got. \n\nWhile the restaurant's decor was nice, I go for the food - and on that account, I doubt I'll be back.
3;I found the staff very friendly and welcoming and my sandwich (Leonardo DaVeggie) and pickle delicious.  The iced tea was also very fresh.  I would not hesitate to go back and try something else.
0;I don't like to criticize Art not being an artist, nor music not having the balls to get on stage myself. That being said I went to Phix last night to see a band, the place was lacking AC, the bathrooms were disgusting, the sound sucked, the art....\nI paid $8 bucks for that torture and that hour of my life I will not get back.
0;Trust your gut or your gut will let you know you've made a mistake. I walked in and there was no one inside, the place looked filthy and no one was at the counter.\nI walked back out but because of the convenience, my craving for Chinese, and the ability to run a few nearby errands while waiting, I went back in. I was finally greeted and made my order.\nThere isn't much more to say. I've had better sesame chicken at Panda Express. I didn't get food poisoning but I was feeling ill afterwards.\nSome people work out or do yoga the morning after hard night of partying to sweat out the toxins. I was up at 5:15 for a 5-mile run to unload this experience.
2;The food was good and our waitress was amazing. The menus were dirty and other customers were very loud. The wait on our food was a little longer then usual but it was worth the wait.
0;About the worst customer service I have ever had.  I don't know Toby Keith personally but I can't imagine he would want his name associated with the kind of service I received.
4;You're enchanting. \nSomeone with a certain je ne sais quoi...call it aplomb.   \nYour friends know you as the life of the party. The 'crazy' one. The one who takes all the risks and always comes out the better for it. \n\nWell if this is you. And you've yet to succumb to death in any number of odd ways. \nIf you're the type who can ingest a couple hits of LSD, drink a bottle of Johnny Walker Black, and drawing on your Catholic school years, recite the Catholic mass in it's entirety at a Mexican beach resort. Have I got the perfect place for you. \n\nO'Donogue's Pub. \nHere is where you can 'put on the dog' as all of elite Scottsdale looks on.  \nStart with a shot of MIdleton's Irish whiskey. It's cost around fifteen bucks a shot but worth every penny.  \nThis is no ordinary whiskey folks. This tastes like the glistening sweat from a nubile  young...[record scratch]  sorry, the Midleton's.\n\nIt's much too expensive to get cronked on, you'll need to alternate with Irish Car Bombs and Guinness 'pints'. \nOne problem. \nThe pints take f.o.r.e.v.e.r to pour, since O'Donoghue's insist's on using all of the 119.5 seconds its maker recommends while pouring. For this reason, you'll need the bombs and shots to fill in. \nIf you've never tried this, I highly recommend this triumvirate of drinks. \nQuite simply, their majesty is untouched by lesser drinking combinations, paring much the same way as does a fine Bordeaux with a Filet au Poivre and a side of bernaise. \nTrust me on this one. \n\nTo wit, when properly consumed, and in the order recommended, the car bomb, Guinness and Middleton make for a deliciously fun afternoon. Laughs. Practical jokes. Darts that never seem to find their target. \nAnd those Scottdale elites, looking on in horror and disbelief that anyone could get this drunk on a Tuesday night. \nSuffice to say, you'll have so much fun, when you leave and one of your friends insults your truck's towing capacity by suggesting it isn't mildly capable of dragging someone's open windowed Camry from the Fry's parking lot over to the Starbucks drive-thru, where you'll leave it for dead, you'll take that wager!\n\nAfter all, you're that special someone. \nThe one with all the je ne sais quois....assholiness in this case.\n\nNote: To the owner of the late model red Camry in the Fry's parking lot...I hope we didn't fuck-up your car too badly. FYI, we did use a nylon tow strap wrapped around your rear axle, so there shouldn't be any damage to speak of. \nIf there is, it was my buddy Dave's idea. (and bet) \nI didn't actually do any of the rigging....I just drove. \nAnd, laughed.\nA lot.\nAnyways...sorry.
2;A touch of Thai -- literally.  Maybe, the name said it all.  Just a tad bit not too much or it might overwhelm you!  Seriously, I need my Thai not just a touch!  Food was decent I must say, but kinda pricey.  Though I enjoyed my Dragon Noodles regardless.  Service was okay, very friendly, but tad bit slow since there were only 2 other tables around.  I totally dig the d\u00e9cor, very calm and relaxed.  However, my only complaint was that it was too quiet.  What!?  I felt like I had to whisper cause someone could be listening in on my conversation.  (Yeah, if I were a girl I would date him....huh!) - Enjoy!
1;Nothing I had here stood out. Mediocre, or worse.\nWe had some apps, and the Ramen, in particular, was bad.\nWill not be going back.
2;I have to concur with some other reviewers comments that there was nothing remarkable one way or the other about the food here.\n\nI've always enjoyed Asia Lee. It's a welcoming, if a bit dingy atmosphere and the folks there are always friendly. The wait is never too bad and the menu is fairly well rounded. It's a comfortable place to be.\n\nBut it's nothing special. The food is pretty decent, if not spectacular. Sometimes it's a bit dry. But overall, it's quick and cheap Chinese food and usually satisfies my desire.
3;They would only get three stars because you have to woo me a bit more to get four stars but the toddler and I have been going to the Summer time kid movie thing every Thursday morning where you pay $7 in advance for 10 rerun kids movies (a friends dad had to tell us about it - I'm not one of those moms that intuitively knows where all these kids things are going on at all times). They manage all those kids pretty well and the theater is pretty clean. That alone impresses me.
1;Really disappointed in this place after reading so many previous Yelp reviews that were so positive.  Bottom line was the pizza and cheese sticks we had were less than mediocre. I have high pizza expectations as it is my favorite food and has been for forty years and Molly's just doesn't stand up. No crispness to the crust...very floppy. Sausage is grated? No where near enough cheese especially on the cheese bread...ahem...cheese bread...hellllloooo? It should be covered in cheese.  See my pics.  One positive...inexpensive and fast...but you get what you pay for.
3;I went to Asie Moderne to try one particular dish.\n\nI ordered their sour soup with tripe and beef.\n \nI was very happy! I grew up eating Cambodian dishes and the soup taste just like my mom used to make it.
0;"I've stayed here twice and the first time wasn't so bad.  I wasn't expecting much for the price, but we didn't run into any problems because we were staying in the newly remodeled north tower.  The second time, we arrived at 2am due to a chemical spill on the freeway that turned our 4 hour drive into an 8 hour drive.  When we got there, we had to stand in a huge line and right before our turn the clerk let a lady cut in front of us because she was having a problem with our room...Okay, but I just wanted to get to our room!  Turns out that this lady wanted a new room because the toilet was broken so they switched her rooms.  When we were finally helped, I was told that the King size non-smoking room that I reserved was no longer available and that all she had left was a king size smoking or a double queen non smoking...Yeah because they had just given our room away to the other lady!  But, being so tired, I was in no room to argue so I just went with the double queen non-smoking...It must have been the room that the other lady had just turned in.  When we got there, first of all you could hear the entire freemont street experience from the bathroom every hour.  It was so loud!  There were NO TOWELS, The bathroom floor was soaking wet and there was hair on it, disgusting!  And the carpet near the bathroom was soaking wet too.  But, being that it was so late, all the other hotels were booked and that we literally only needed to sleep for a couple hours, my boyfriend wiped up the water with a bathmat and we went to sleep. A few hours later, we were awoken by a god awful \""Bloop\"" noise every few minutes.  The toilet was making bubbles and that's where the water was coming from.  There was toilet water all over the tile and carpet, so gross.  I couldn't even pee because I was afraid to sit on the toilet in fear that I might bubble while I was on it!  The only good thing that I have to say about this place is that they gave us our money back.  So ghetto."
0;Overall, blas\u00e9 atmosphere (kinda tacky really - red, orange and yellow color palate, which Arizona pulls off better than anyone, but not in this space - it looked like a converted ball room from the early 1990's) and terribly unimpressive hostess. Can't say anything for the food, the initial disappointment with the atmosphere and service was enough for us to decide not to waste our money on a subpar experience (which it would have been regardless of how good the food was).\n\nWe arrived here after having had a negative drinks and appetizer experience at Sol Mexican Concina (which was recommended to us by Allan, a Westin concierge when we said we were looking for a place with local flare and high-end service like The Mission in Old Town - oh goodness could they not have been further from the mark). This was also recommended, so we tried it next. The menu looked okay so we decided to give it a try, the hostess tried to insist on having us sit in the small lounge area, but we wanted a more elegant dining experience since it was my birthday, so we asked to be seated in the main dining area. She just looked at us confused, literally twirling a strand of her hair with both hands (i wish I had gotten a photo of this - it would have been down right comical how ditzy she was acting if I weren't hungry and frustrated with the Westin's poor track record with recommendations so far). Ultimately she did seat us in the main dining area, but along a back wall away from everything and everyone EXCEPT* another couple whose booth was situated so that they were staring right at us (so awkward). There was plenty of other seating in the restaurant but we already felt like we were being difficult so we didn't want to bother them by asking to be seated anywhere else. Our waiter came over and told us about the specials that evening, and we had to laugh because their special was the exact same as the special at Sol Mexican Cocina (skirt steak), which both servers pushed pretty hard. I'm guessing it must have been on sale in the area or something? This was when we decided we'd be happier with a movie, a bottle of wine and tapas in our villa - it was sad because we really wanted to have a nice dinner out, but the remorse would have been much greater had we settled for either of the two sad recommendations we received from Allan, the Westin concierge.
0;"I have ordered from China star numerous times and I never had an issue, but this last time was a nightmare! They sold me uncooked rice.... the rice was raw. Even the vegetables in the rice were raw and crunchy. Then when I called back, one of the employees told me to \""put it in the microwave.\"" They refused to refund me! If you want to order food here, order at your own risk; I just wouldn't try the pork fried rice. :("
4;Everyday Noodles is probably the best place to enjoy Chinese noodles and wrapped dumpling offerings in Pittsburgh. There is usually a line waiting to be seated, but the clientele, kitchen and service staff moves quickly so the wait is usually not terrible. \n\nThe service has always been quick and professional.\n\nThe lamian (handpulled noodles), were cooked perfectly were provided just enough bite. The minced pork sauce noodles are also very flavorful. The shrimp and pork wonton noodle soup is also very good. \n\nThe pork soup dumplings are very juicy, and the shrimp-pork shaomais offer that nice crunch that you expect from shrimp (although at times you lose the bottom side of the dumpling skin and much of the liquid flavorful goodness in the steamer liner). \n\nPortions were generous and the prices are very reasonable.\n\nThe owner, Michael Chen, can often be spotted in the restaurant and often asked customers whether they enjoyed their meals while removing their empty plates and bowls. I think that is always a good sign for a restaurant.
4;"Waitstaff was super friendly.  Food was great \""diner\"" style, no surprises.  Pancakes were just great, coffee was hot and plentiful.  Food arrived fast - and my waitress even offered to HEAT UP MY SYRUP!!!  Place was extremely clean - I really liked this place. \n\nI ordered the chocolate chip pancakes and they were fantastic.  Waitress was very tentative to our needs.  I'll be back, for sure."
1;I have been to this place multiple times. I love the food ( when done right) and the atmosphere is awesome. However, my issue is that they don't put nearly enough sauce on the wings. Most times I get wings that end up being bare on one side. With such great sauces, and wings being the selling point  of this restaurant, I would imagine that they would be a little more generous with the sauce.  You have to ask for extra sauce to get a normal amount.  Service tends to be on the slower side also. I don't mind waiting a while usually, but just so others know.
1;"I love Mexican food. Its hard to disappoint me when I know I'm going to eat this food. Yet this place did find many other ways to make that happen. First the host placed me and my wife at a booth that would fit 8 people. The window was facing the afternoon sun and she never asked to lower the blinds. After a few minutes of sitting in the direct sun and starting to sweat, I asked we could be moved. She asked if we wanted to sit at the bar. \"" No, please just seat us at another table or booth\"".  She did as I asked. Even though the table she took us to was clean on top, you could have filled a waste basket with the food and chips that where under it. She grabbed a broom and did sweep it out. So I started to look around. The place was a complete mess. Tables with plates and food still on them and the floor was a complete disaster. Ok, lets just eat I told my wife. The waitress ask for our drink order. Great time for a margarita. Not really. Time for a lot of sweet and sour. The food was just middle of the road. I hope your experience is better than mine."
3;I get take out on a frequent basis. I love their sweet sour soup !  Good quality for a reasonable price. The dine-in area is small and dated.  I always call in my order. Never a problem.
3;Came here late one night after an event in Phoenix, to have a few drinks and snacks.  The nachos on the won ton chips are delightful and very different then anything I've ever had.  I absolutely loved them!
0;IP is pretty much one of the worst places you can stay on the strip which is unfortunate because its right in the center of the strip. \n\nThey buffet is pretty gross and will most likely make you sick. \n\nThe rooms are definitely get what you pay for, you will have a cheap room and if that's all you need is a place to crash you will do fine here. Id just rather pay a few bucks more and stay at the harrahs which is a little bit more expensive and way nicer. \n\nThe poker room has some shady guys working there, I have seen multiple winning hands mucked that cost someone over 50 dollars due to a dealer mistake. Even when the mistake was admitted and a request was asked to check the cameras they don't use them for that. Pretty ridiculous.\n\nYou can stay and gamble here if you want a sub par vegas trip but I wont be back and I look forward to the day this hotel is demolished.
0;Food is okay when they get your order right! I think forced labor gives better customer service but at least the location is convenient.
4;I love this store...  I  lived in mountains edge... that store is tooo cuteeee... cute and afordable for us hard working girlies who gotta pay bills and also need to shop to be cute and happy ...LOL   Yes the girls here are sooo nice and Genuinne...not fake or rude... its a fun store and everything is color coordinated... LOVE THAT !!!!  Thanks girls for making it a funnn and fab store that cheers up the ladies of Vegas.... u ROCK !!!!
4;Don't be alarmed by the looks on the outside. This place is a beaut! :)\nI looked at their menu twice, maybe three times because I couldn't find anything vegetarian. My heart almost sank until I mentioned it to the waitress. She said they have vegetarian pho as well as other dishes made with tofu and vegetable broth. For some reason they don't list it on their menu.\nPhwww! \nThere was no way I was getting my husband out of there without eating something. \n\nI ordered vegetable pho (usually made with beef broth) it had tofu. I forgot to say no mushrooms so I took them out and noticed that they were the fanciest mushroom I've ever seen, like something out of a children's book. I was a little sad that I wasn't going to eat them being that they were so cute and presentable. But no worries, my husband gorged on them. \nHe had a meat dish with noodles. We both rolled out of there, we ate until the last drop. \n\nThis is a restaurant we'll be visiting over and over in the future. In fact, we're taking my brother this Saturday to try Vietnamese food for the first time. I can't wait. He eats anything.
2;A bit pricey for what it is. A bit more smoke and mirrors than actual quality. It is not a bad place. Food is good, but there are much better places close by that are a bit better. \n\nIf you need some pizza pretty quick and your and in the biltmore area, and you want a classy joing, then this is the place...\n\nhave fun
1;Excellent service mais nourriture m\u00e9diocre, nous avons opt\u00e9 pour 2 salades vertes , calmars frits ( tr\u00e8s graisseux) et pizza marguerita, la sauce de la pizza \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s bonne mais la cro\u00fbte \u00e9taient molasse, le fromage \u00e9tait seche m'indiquant que celle -ci \u00e9tait sorti du four trop t\u00f4t!
4;I love this store! The staff rocks and their process are also pretty reasonable. If you're looking for somewhere with knowledgeable staff, and a nurse that also prescribes medicinal herb blends then this is your place!
4;I can't say enough great about this truck and about everything that surrounds it's management and follow-through.  We hired the truck for a private party and everything went off flawlessly.  The food is outstanding and the service is just as good.  The dumplings, the chicken even the ice tea were huge hits.   This is the way to cater a party.  Hire great truck, truck brings, cooks and delivers great food, all mess and fuss drive away with the truck.  Smiling, happy, laughing guests are both nourished by great food and delighted with Jake, a great host!!
0;This store just irritates me...but since it is really close to home I usually use it. My biggest gripe is ...they used to have really top quality fresh organic salmon....but for the past year they have been using a different supplier or something because its now just rubbish. The freshness is questionable, badly sliced,no consistency in sizes and the factory in Ontario removes the skin which makes it almost impossible to broil or bbq it without breaking it up..just terrible quality.I'm now activly looking for a new supply. Also they never seem to have any fresh Pacific salmon so most of the fish they carry is farmed junk. It seems to me that companies, for some mysterious unknown reason, keep finding it necassary to ruin a perfectly good and popular product be it a grocery product, a web page or a restuarant menu. Unbelievable.
0;Ordered edamame...never came...server then forgot about us and the sushi chef had to come take our order (much appreciated). Ordered beer...the server forgot...  Food came out....they forgot the rice for the beef terriyaki...we reminded our server about the rice that was forgotten...he forgot again...\n\nNoticing a theme here?  The staff was very nice but were extremely forgetful and non responsive.  After voicing my frustration and asking to just get our food boxed up, we ended up getting one of our rolls that we ordered on the house.  I thought this was a nice gesture, but hardly enough to make up for this frustrating experience.  I would have understood the lack of service if they were incredibly busy, but they were not.  They just seemed to be understaffed for a saturday night.   It is a shame because the terriyaki steak and the chirashi bowl we ordered were both very good.  I will not be returning to this place and will be eating the rest of my dinner that was boxed upat home after i make some rice.  Assuming that i dont forget!
2;"Great homemade tortillas but meat was bland. Needed to use outside sauces and salsa to flavor, but maybe that's deliberate. Floor needed to be swept a little but appeared very clean otherwise. Very casual/simple dining, almost like fast food. Not a sit-down and be served by a waiter place; you stand in line and your food is handed to you on a plastic tray. Other reviews I've read seemed to have been expecting a traditional sit-down restaurant and that's just not what this place is. It's very laid back but the food is real good."
3;Nice cozy place, great service. Food comes out fast and is consistently delicious. Would definitely recommend. My favorite is the bacon wrapped dates and the sangria by far.
3;Had a great lunch here.  Took about 15 minutes to get seated but it was worth it.  Service was excellent.  My Hangover Burger was perfectly cooked and very tasty.  I would recommend this place to anyone who shares my love of burgers!
0;Never go to the Rio buffet. Sooooo salty you can't enjoy your food. Disappointed, and 67 dollars short. Sigh... NOBUENO.
1;This place is a little more pricey than most, which is fine if the product was exceptional, but I was not impressed. To me, the coffee tasted watered down. I did like the ambiance and there were no problems with the service.
1;I really should give this place a break since it is opening day but with a chain should there really be growing pains? Dickie's is a national chain with tens of stores.. should they be out of pulled pork? Potato Salad? Dirty tables and condiment area? Should the staff be rough around the edges? You know them not having pulled pork is like McDonald's being out of Big Macs!\n\nEating here lead to more questions then it did answers. Why were the ribs like jerky? Or the beef brisket moist tender and juicy? The food was just all over the place in terms of its preparation. There was a very steady stream of customers who seemed very happy that they were open. Of course I had a cloud above my head and wondered why a chain with so many stores was so off?\n\nNot sure if there will be a repeat visit anytime soon.. perhaps in a few weeks or months they will get it all 'pulled' together? Ouch!
0;I'vr been calling and leaving messages and cannot get a return call.  Andy might be good but he isn't good about returning messages.
0;horrible place to rent a car! The employees must get a kick back from ripping people off. DONT NOT RENT FROM these people unless u want to ruin your vacation!
4;A beautiful setting and GREAT food.  Have the burger!
1;Not surprised that this place closed down. Mediocre food, small selection in their lunch buffet, and weak service equals dead restaurant walking on borrowed time. The only positive aspect of our visit was we met another Indian cuisine loving couple who we actually ended up sitting down with at the same table. They told us that their favorite Indian place was Mt. Everest, and wouldn't you know it, it has become one of our faves too!
3;Wondered in here yesterday in search of delicious breakfast fare. Did I find it? I'd say so.\nI just moved to the Melrose District area and have been eager to try every breakfast place and visit all of the antique shops (but that's another story...). My boyfriend and I came here for brunch. I was immediately taken in by the super kitschy and cute decor and friendly wait staff. \n\nI ordered Huevos Rancheros and my boyfriend ordered a 2 egg breakfast with a waffle. We both got coffee. Our food was delivered quite quickly and was super delicious. The Huevos Rancheros had the perfect amount of spiciness and I tried a bite of my boyfriend's waffle-fluffy and light. The food was fresh and tasty. \n\nThe prices are ridiculously inexpensive and the portions are quite large despite that. I've grown used to paying a pretty penny at Old Town brunch places so this was a nice change of pace. \n\nDespite the speediness of service, my only critique was that I couldn't really tell who my server was since we had 3 different people stop by our table...also it took a bit to get a water refill that I had asked for. \n\nOverall, this is a great place to grab a quick bite before 7th Avenue shopping adventures. I will definitely be back since I live so close!
4;My best friend and I walked in on a Sunday afternoon to browse around because I really needed to bite the bullet and get the dress situation handled with less than 6 months before my wedding. \n\nLucky for us, they had no appointments and we were the only ones there. My best friend convinced me to try a couple things on even though I totally didn't want to, and I ordered my dress and veil by the end of the hour and a half that we were there! Laurie was a godsend. She knows the product, and really wanted me to find something because the Allure dresses were all $500 off and she wanted to avoid putting a rush on the dress.\n\nI still had to rush the dress to be safe, but I still saved a bunch on my dress, and I can't wait until it comes in. I will definitely update my review when the time comes!\n\nEven if they don't have THE designer you are looking for, you should really really REALLY call and make an appointment or stop in to take a look at the amazing dresses they stock. They will give you a great product and great advice because they aren't on commission!
3;"I've been going to the spot ever since it opened.  At first, I wasn't that impressed but over the past few months, I feel they have gotten a lot better...  \n\nThe food isn't food to \""die over\"", it's good for lunch/dinner once and a while...  But I mostly go to it because it's convenient... With delivery and online ordering, it makes the decision easy, especially when none of the local competitors in the area offer neither online ordering or delivery."
2;I had to just double check my receipts to make sure we're all talking about the same Walgreens. Yes, this is the one. This store is just north of all the hustle from the busy Strip itself. I drove here from The Quad almost every other day for my cigarette fix. Until I realized a few days later there is a very nice larger Walgreens right next to The Venetian which was closer to me. I don't know really, it's a Walgreens which came in very handy on my first day in Vegas after realizing I forgot some things back home. I wouldn't walk to this location from where I was staying though. There are also other shops surrounding it which are more affordable than your usual tourist traps down the street, e.g., Dennys, Ross, Liquor Store, Souvenir Stores.
0;"Quite disappointed!!!  The front desk asked me why I was checking in \""so late\"", it was 9:15pm. \""free wifi\"" that I was not able to access in my suite.  When given directions to my room, I was told to \""just follow the map\"". Yes, the map was decent but not really the attitude to have. \n\nThe \""suite\"" was less than what I would have expected. This is at a Nice Golf Club, which I would think many people want to relax at the end of the night by watching a little TV I. Their room. Obviously, the designer of the room felt completely different. I had to sit in a small chair in the bedroom or lay on a small couch in the living room to watch TV. \n\nNever once did I see a channel guide, I guess they want you to have fun guessing what would be next. The remotes died after about 5 minutes of having the TV on. \n\nI could go on, but you get the drift. I'll take my chances with the Quality Inn it head down to the Courtyard, at least they know what they are doing."
0;Terrible food. Its a total insult to mexican food. The place smells of wet mop year round. (I'm a flight attendant that walks by there at least 3 times a week.) The drinks are watered down and the alcohol in mixed drinks is of the cheapest quality. But for a town like Vegas where some people stay drunk throughout their visit this  might be the place for the indiscriminate bunch.
1;There's nothing special about their donuts :(
3;"We stayed here the weekend of 4/19/13 to 4/21/13 \nI booked this hotel on hotels.com. We came her for my sisters 21st birthday and me and my husband wanted to find something cheap and roomy and we noticed this place had a kitchen and washer/dryer so so i booked it right then and there, i noticed it wasn't on the strip but that's fine because it had a free shuttle service and that was great we planed on using it but i will talk more about that later. The service:So we walking into the lobby to check in and it was packed people looked confused and so did the workers they just looked over whelmed like they had never seen that many people in there hotel before (i guess people were there for a time share presentation) so we make or way up the the registration desk and a nice young man welcomes us and says if he can help and i say yes and we check in he was really nice i don't remember his name but (i believe it was delmar) i could be wrong not sure.Anyways we have to go to another desk to get a parking pass (which is free) and the lady asked if we were part of the time share thing we said no and she asked if we wanted to go and see if we were interested and we would get a gift card of 100$ so i said sure why not i always wanted to see how those worked anyway so she signs us up for the next morning. The Room: We finally make our way up to the room and you know how they always make the picture online look all fancy and when you get there it isn't well i kid you not when we got to our room it looked exactly like the picture but better the kitchen was great it came complete with everything you would need and the washer/dryer was really easy to use if your husband can use it you know its easy haha there were two showers and the master shower had two shower heads which me and my husband though where cool especially if you want to save water ;) the room was great the bed was comfortable and they had a lot of towels we didn't even has to call for more.The pool: We didn't get a chance to go in were we busy with my sister birthday a lot of the time and we really wanted to go in but time wasn't on our side but it looked nice we went to go check it out there is a bar in there but for some reason it isn't open like there was no liquor or cups like it was new which i though was weird but whatever.The shuttle: Okay so the shuttle where do i start its a good idea but it only comes every 1 hour and it doesn't bring you back which is weird because there right next to the MGM grand so they could or should make it were they drop you off there since the monorail is there anyways if you wanted to get a round and also they stop it around 8 which is lame because no one party's that early unless you plan on getting drunk before 11 and going home haha and it would be great not having to worry about drinking and driving and taxi here are so expensive its crazy so i wished it could of did that but i know your probably thinking now your asking for to much lol but still that just my 2 cents.The time share: We woke up early around 9am since it was at 10am the lady said to come 10 mins early so we did so we can check in there,so we tell them our name and they cant find us they go and look around ask other employees get the main managers and then finally say they have to sign us up again so we get told to go out again and sign up were we were last time, so we go and this nice lady helps us (this time i really don't remember here name), so we sign up again and she apologize for the inconvenience and says instead of 100$ we will get 125$ so i am like okay that's really nice of her, so we go to the time share thing and this guy name ron is talking about all the great places he has been and starts saying how it our fault that \""we\"" don't ever go on vacation and blah blah talking about all the money he has and all the places he has been (you know if you have been to one) they say there not gonna presser you but they did when we get out but we cant afford it and honestly it sounded great but we have small kids and it just wont work now,so what did i learn about this: well you know that line time is money well for poor people or not so financially people ,money is time because if you have the money then you would have the time, you cant go on vacation with out money first! The check out: so we woke up at 9 and our check out time is at 10 and we wanted to eat and go swimming before we left, so i called down stairs and ask if we could stay longer and they said we can stay till 11 and after that its 20$ an hour so me and my husband go out to eat we get home around 10 and decided we need to leave because we really missed our kids and our home but honestly i wished we could have stayed longer and next time we are gonna bring the kids because the whole time we were there we kept talking about how the kids would enjoy this and everything vegas has to offer for the kids, i cant write anymore so i will leave it at this We had a great time and will be coming back"
0;"Yuck\nIn a word \""Yuck\"" . All items taste like they were cooked in old oil. Never again. We will be going back to Asian Grill."
0;This*  place*   situated in  new york new york is  more like a dive you would find in any 3rd world country than a saloon \n I fully expected to discover the bathroom  was just a hole  in the middle of a room .. it was,nt but not much better.\n\n  cover charge,  bouncers bullying  female  patrons to remove their bras ,  awfully  loud music, no where to sit ,expensive drinks and skanks dancing on the bar while they squirted  some sort of  drink  in your mouth seemed  to be the mode of this establishment .\n\nthe male customers  who  looked like extras out of a horror movie were  sloppily  dressed and slivering around  with a bored  look  on thier  faces gazing attentively at the stage hoping  for a glimpse of a breast  or perhaps a crotch shot from the gyrating  dancers .\n\n not a hope\n    we had one drink (cost a arm & leg )found a vacant space on the  wall  to  lean against  untill   we could,nt stand the   noise  any more and left    not a place we would visit again   but part  of the  Las Vegas  experiance ..
4;"I needed my front brakes fixed really bad. I drove in around 2:00 without an appointment and threw it out there that I needed to leave by 4:15 at the latest. They said it would be plenty of time, and that I didn't need to come back a different day. I didn't catch the names of the dudes that helped in the beginning, but everyone rocks at this dealer. \n\nCathy Solorzano is by far the best service advisor I have ever worked with. I have lived in many states, and always used a Toyota dealer for my service, over private companies. I trust that she won't screw me over. \n\nI know if I go in for a routine maintenance, that she won't tell me that there is a unicorn in my engine and at a certain mileage that I should re paint, and change out the seats. \n\nShe knew it was getting close to 4:15 and put a rush on them getting my car to me. Her persistence was very much appreciated. \n\nI made it to work on time, and the strip doesn't hear my car stop from a mile away! It is just nice to see someone care, and not just give a price and have a \""take it or leave it\"" attitude, which is what I have normally dealt with in other dealers."
1;I'm not a troll. I don't usually make bad reviews, but today was a bad day in Starbucks of the Arizona Mills Mall. I waited in a slow moving line of only 3 people in front of me. By the time it was my turn, I ordered a blended chai tea latte. I would have gotten something to eat, like the double chocolate brownie, a berry coffee cake or even a banana bread. They were out of everything, except for carrot cake, which I don't like. Next, I waited twenty minutes for my drink. You know what? I paid $5.36 to wait for my drink to get to me eventually, and that is unsatisfactory! Also, slow wi-fi. If you're going to provide slow wi-fi, you may as well cancel it!
4;The food was absolutely amazing here.  No wait, cute atmosphere and the prices were good.  Forget those high priced buffets when you can eat here!  Service was great!
0;"Ticks! Ticks! Ticks! The park was closed 1 Month last month for \""turf maintenance.\"" My dogs got ticks right before it closed.  It re opened and I now AM battling tick infestation. Per other reviews note below: be mindful! I will not be taking my dogs back for a long time. BEWARE!"
1;"It's not very often any more that I'm excited to try a new burger in town, and when I do I really have to make a conscious effort to not set myself up for disappointment. Honey Salt recently opened in Summerlin, and as an overall foodie I've been very excited to try this new spot. While I didn't make it there too often, I always enjoyed Nora's that used to be in the space, both the menu and farm-to-table concept of its replacement gave me much hope. So after impatiently waiting a few weeks to let the crowds die down I finally ventured in there for dinner one night (and ran into foodie friend Splurgemonkey). Did it disappoint?\n\nThe space itself doesn't look too different from what I can remember; the exposed kitchen is still on display for you to enjoy all the madness that goes on with food prep. There is a large faux brick feature wall with the Honey Salt logo, and some nice, simple decorations on the walls. The room is quite loud even not at full capacity, but at our small table for two it was cozy enough that we didn't have much of a problem. There are several menus depending on the time of day which I won't bother replicating here. The food is all regionally grown, and you can tell by the menu offerings and quality of food you receive that they pay attention to what they're putting in their dishes. I've heard many positive comments through friends and online about their meals, and really wish I could have had a bit more than the burger, but that's what I do and I was still expecting something great to come out.\n\nWhat did come out was one perfectly crafted burger, but had absolutely no stand out flavors whatsoever. The meat was really great quality; it was cooked perfectly to the medium rare I ordered, but had no strong beef flavor, no char flavor, no seasoning, nothing. The $1 optional egg on top added very little, as did the lettuce and tomato even though they were all of very good quality. The butter pickles were the only strong and good flavor I noticed in there. Even the bun, which had a good sweet smell to it, had almost nothing going on. This could easily become the perfect burger if it had a secret sauce or just the right additional ingredient. All the other food we had that night was so flavorful and delicious, this should have been too. My girlfriend's steak had great seasoning, and some fantastic sauces with it; why did that beef get a different treatment than this one? In fact, adding the roasted Anaheim salsa that comes with the filet or even the potato bacon hash to the burger would make it incredible, but I shouldn't have to order a side of either to make their offering better.\n\nOddly enough, the fries were fantastic; they were cooked crispy and consistent throughout. They had great flavor and were better than a lot I've had around town considering how unassuming they looked. I was very saddened by this burger; as I said everything else we ate that night was heavily seasoned, flavorful and delicious, but this burger was so plain and frustrating. For $15 I really couldn't recommend it, that's just far too much for a Summerlin location even considering the quality of ingredients. Our entire meal, which included two cocktails, an appetizer, two main dishes and a dessert, came to $115 with tip, which I found to be way too much for an off-strip location. I usually skip dessert when I'm out so this is a bit odd, but my girlfriend skipped getting any sides with her meal which would have easily increased our total even with subtracting the cheap-ish dessert. Some of the other dinners I saw around our table looked great, although maybe a bit small in portion size given the cost. If you're looking for strictly burger advice here, I can't recommend Honey Salt at this time, and would rather send you across the street to Flemings."
0;I went tonight at this restaurant for the first time, the food was ok. What I really didn't like was the service was terrible, especially the waitress who served us not the young and skinny one but the older one with bangs. There are many places where the ramen and service are way more better. Wouldn't go there anymore.
1;This place has a fantastic outdoor patio and makes for a great place to sip back and enjoy a few beers. We split the brewer's feast and particularly enjoyed the southwest egg rolls with a roasted jalapeno ranch dressing. I enjoyed their winter seasonal and their Sweet Magnolia brown ale. However, they didn't make my top favorite beer selection and other than that I really didn't find any of their brews to be that great. Overall, I'd recommend going elsewhere with a better beer selection from multiple breweries. Of course, much of this review reflects my distaste for chain restaurants and breweries.
4;What do you do when you are damn hungry and want to eat really tasty food somewhere on The Strip at 02:00 hrs? Well, you go to Grand Lux Cafe :)\n\nI was staying in Venetian with my wife and was looking for some food joint near by. Grand Lux Cafe came to our mind since we liked the complimentary breakfast here. We ordered  Veggie Burger, Margarita Pizza and Garden Omelette. Here is what we liked about this cafe:\n1. Food was just awesome. It was so tasty that we ended up eating a lot more\n\n2. Serving size was much more than we expected(at least if I compare that to Gordon Ramsay Burgr)\n\n3. Ambience is really really good\n\n4. It is not costly at all\n\n5. Wide variety of options to choose from. Me and my wife are eggetarian and even we could find sufficient number of options to choose from\n\n6. It is open 24 hrs\n\nSomething not to miss in Vegas !
2;The soup came with the crepe was good, and the crepes are good too.  It's a good to try it there but I am not sure if I will go back since it's so out of the way.
3;The wings here are great.  I have had them once, but I know people who only order wings now, after the initial taste.  It's worth a shot.  I like variety too much to do that.\n\nI went yesterday and had the beef rib.  It was fall off the bone style, with some tasty bbq slathered on.  I topped it off with some hush puppies, for a very hearty meal.\n\nI've had tacos on a previous visit, and they are also very tasty.  I strongly recommend the brownie a la mode if you have room.  I rarely eat dessert, but I just had a bite of someone's and it was amazing.
1;Same thing as Dennys at almost twice the price. Marginally decent food and service.  It was clean and food was pretty quick, even with a nearly full restaurant. Parking is horrendous when all the places there are busy.
0;Bad service. Bad drinks. Bad food. Go to the one in Cancun instead. No comparison. This place should not have the senor frogs name.
4;Great to see so many Vegas families taking their kids to develop an interest in science and/or nourish that existing interest.  So glad I was able to take my kids to this, the involvement of the community, and to Yelp for sponsoring this event as well.  Education is so important, and helping kids become passionate about something that matters is essential beyond the words that exist to describe it.\n\nGreat work, and thank you for making this a free event!
3;Great place to get pizza! We accidentally showed up at closing time. The staff didn't tell us, which was nice. We ordered a whole pizza, spaghetti dinner, and garlic knots. Service was extremely fast and polite. \n\nThe best thing about the whole experience was my daughter ordered the spaghetti without meat sauce, I asked for some butter, the employee said we do not have butter. So I said ok. About five minutes later the employee came back with a cup of melted butter from the restaurant next-door. I was totally shocked, what a great thing that employee did for my daughter!!\n\nAlso I will warn you with the garlic knots, I loved them! My wife doesn't like a lot of garlic and they do come with a boatload of garlic! So prepare yourself. \n\nI highly recommend this place, the only reason why I did not give it five stars was the cost of the pizza. It seem expensive. $20-$25 for a pizza pie.  However we are not from Charlotte, so I'm sure if that's normal pricing around here for pizza.
4;One of my favorite places. I work here, I relax here, I meet friends here, I'm not vegetarian but I eat that here and love every bite. \nYou can't go wrong stopping (or driving thru) by here.
1;I went to the supposed Grand Opening of Joystixx Gamer's Lounge inside of Hooters last night after April S. and Melissa S. promoted it at the Vegas Young Professionals mixer Thursday night. As you drive in, you get the feeling that you are entering the ghetto as you try to maneuver around the parking garage. Once you enter the casino, it gets even worse, so much so that you are EXTREMELY lucky to get a cell signal in the place.  You find Joystixx in a corner near the buffet and they have an air hockey table and some pool tables near the front and at least 3 rows of video games as well as some basketball hoops and skee ball. I've been to Insert Coins on Fremont and that place is heaven compared to what Joystixx is trying to accomplish. My friends and I left after about an hour since there was no one in there. We don't think the place will last very long especially if they don't advertise or try to advertise as something they are obviously not. There is HONESTLY no comparison to Dave & Busters at all.  It's pretty bad when the employees outnumber the clientele.
3;Oh thank god we stumbled upon this place in the midst of $40-per-plate restaurants. I had an excellent burger cooked perfectly plus you can get a steak there or other random things like spring rolls or lobster corn dogs. My friend had the fish tacos and there were three of them and on full-sized corn tortillas - not the smaller ones like you would expect. Good casual kick-back food at $15-$30, much less than most of the restaurants in this area of the casino.
3;Wicked Spoon was very decent for dinner and breakfast - it did not blow my mind and is not the best Vegas buffet I've ever been too, but it is quite decent and I would go there again for convenience if I was stayed at Cosmopolitan again.  I loved the boiled peanuts (my family is from Hawaii and I can eat a mountain of these!)!  I also loved the meats, mashed potatoes, fish, lobster, vegetables.  For breakfast, I loved the boiled peanuts (!!), made to order omelette, hashbrowns, lox bagels. Mmmm!  And don't forget the chocolate covered strawberries!!  They also offer buffet to go, so inquire about that in case you don't have time for the whole buffet experience.  A-ok service -- I think maybe we went back for rounds so often so fast that they couldn't quite keep up clearing our plates, but otherwise, they are attentive with drinks and requests.
0;Positively horrendous. The food is sickening, greasy, stale, and in horrid combinations (mozzarella sticks and chicken nuggets and mayonnaise and fries on a donut bun? really?) The tables are never wiped off or cleaned, and we had to sit in these gross chairs with used kleenexes tossed everywhere which we grudgingly had to pick up and throw out ourselves. My friend used the restroom and reported that her shoes stuck to the floor with every step. The entire place was swarming with flies. It Was Very Bad.
4;"The Wedding Room is a wonderful place for a wedding reception, with friendly staff, tasty catering, and beautiful decor. It truly is \""elegant and affordable\"", like they say.\n\nBut it isn't only for weddings, it's also a great location for business meetings and other social events, especially since it is in a pretty centralized location.\n\nI'd recommend this place for any kind of social gathering."
4;Receptionist was A+++++ Drew out a map for us, gave us the DL on basically everything you could think of- food, bars, dancing, parks, events & shopping. She was the best! Wish I remembered her name! Our room was super spacious and clean. Perfect stay!
3;Very nice hotel.   Very clean, the rooms were nice, and  The staff were all friendlly and helpful.   The cleaning staff were particularly good and fast.   Nice place to stay visit las vegas
0;"Will never go back again.  It was great when Kiesha was there, but that all changed when she was gone. \n\nDropped off my 3 toy poodles and the 3 women working there were not very friendly - seemed like they all did not get along.  I had asked if the rate was discounted because I was bringing in 3 dogs and the one lady said yes since my \""discounted\"" rate was written on the dogs information card.  When I went to go and pick up the dogs, the 3 women were arguing very loudly and would not stop - very unprofessional.  I went to pay and they would not honor the discount even though it was written on the information card.   They denied ever saying that there is a discount and would explain why the discounted price was written on the card."
1;Tried out burgers for a couple of times and was thoroughly disappointed by the quality. What was more appalling was the way fries were made. They werent cooked properly, stayed too clumsy and tasted awful. \n\nThis is a place, I might probably abstain from visiting again unless I run out of options in Charlotte Area!
4;Best fried chicken I have ever eaten!  Service is a bit unreliable but the chicken makes up for the service.
4;Good place after night work to relax a little bit and drink a hot drink in the Winter. Feel warmed and satisfied.
2;Sympa bitro , mais se rempli trop rapidement . C'est petit .Bonne musique d'ambiance .
2;Fantastic Italian subs! Just like back in Jersey...So much meat, it's like the opposite of all the other sub chains. \n\nWhy do they have to be so far from home?
2;Food and service decent,but I m not hip on smokers, smoking  a few feet from my meal, sorry I will not be going back. But it does have a nice fireplace and outdoor feeling inside ..
1;I have to give 2 stars as the service was excellent.  The food, however, was not.  Crappy boiled ribs with buffalo sauce?  Horrible.  Fakey processed mashed potatoes.  Overpriced and really bad.
4;I was in Phoenix on a business trip.  Had never been to Arizona before, and was looking for some dinner and stumbled upon this place...\n\nSashimi in Arizona? I was a bit hesitant, but little did I know that Arizona actually has some awesome Japanese food, and very high quality fish.\n\nI came in on a Monday night around 8pm.  The place was about half full and I took a seat at the sushi bar.  I ordered the large Chirashi (NOT on the menu, must ask for it, $18.95) and WOW was it awesome.  (There is also a small Chirashi for $12.95 with a little less fish).  when they served it to me, i kinda gasped at how big it was.  Something like this would easily cost $25-$30 in Los Angeles.  Maybe it's the low cost of rent here? but this place was very reasonable for the amount of fish you get.  3 slices of albacore, 3 slices ahi, 3 slices hamachi (yellow tail) and 3 slices of salmon.  I've had better quality fish, but that was at a $100+ Omakase place.  For the price, this place can't be beat.  Service was great, sushi chef and manager were very friendly.  Private parking lot.  I'll definitely be back here next time I'm in the area.
3;"This has been my nail salon for over 2 years now.  They do great manicures, pedicures and waxing. It is always clean and the staff friendly.  I love the salon, but I do have 2 complaints. First, within the past six months I have been asked not to use my debit card to pay and to pay with cash only. I asked \""why?\"" the owner tells me his credit card processing company charges him a lot so he doesnt want to pay the fees.  Second is when I finally have free time away from my children to go in Im told to come back in \""a few hours\"" I personally cant just come back later with 4 children. I go at the time Ive available only to be told to come back. They have lost my business the past 2 months because of this."
4;I have used this place twice in the last week and the service is great ! I will def be back !
4;"Ah-mazziinnngggg!!! Absinthe was one of the best shows I have seen on the strip in a long time.  I've seen most of the Cirque du Soleil shows and while they're all great shows, Absinthe is a mixture of acrobatics and raunchy comedy.  Just like the other reviews, this show is not for everyone.  \n\nI loved the intimate setting of the venue.  I thought I was the only person who knew of Esquivel and loved the fact that you waited for the show listening to his new age bachelor pad music. I wasn't hip on the uncomfortable chairs, but after the performance started, the chairs really didn't matter.  The performers are so close and their abilities of contortion, balance and stamina are mind blowing.  Also, Penny and The Gazillionaire had me nearly peeing my pants because they were so hilarious and you can't beat a comedy duo that can get an \""old, Republican looking\"" woman to motorboat an \""easy\"" slut.  That had the crowd going wild.\n\nAll in all, Absinthe is a MUST see (for non-prudish people) and it's worth every penny."
2;This is the big gambler's PT's.  Lots of big spenders go here.  Problem is with PT's points system.  You have to be a big gambler to benefit... and I'm not.  Food is always decent at PT's but they gyp you on the keno payouts and again, the points aren't generous either.  It feels like the little gamblers are funding the perks for the bigger ones...
1;"Service = EXCELLENT\nFood = MEH\nWine= POOR\n\nOur server was great!  The food wasn't the best. Wine was horrible.  Don't plan for a romantic wine and steak dinner; the wine was the main problem & didn't go good with our meal at all..."
3;I went to an event  hosted at Hotel San Carlos and found the appetizers tasty, nothing special but basic.  The drinks were made well, the room was clean and relaxing, the service was nice and personable.  I think it is a great spot in downtown Phoenix for a social party/gathering!  \n\nI have never stayed in the hotel, so this review is strictly in the event category.  \n\nHotel San Carlos, has great charm and attentive employees.
3;"The ABC store chain is expanding in Las Vegas- a great resource for souvenirs, snacks (baked goods, japanese rice crackers), food (like spam musubi), drinks (soda, water- the most reasonable price, etc.), alcohol (pretty impressive), magazines, t-shirts (cute characters like Hello Kitty), keychains, toiletries, and of course Hawaiian products (nuts, oil, lotion, etc.). On the island of Oahu, there are tons of these stores- and we've been to about 80% of them! (kinda like the 7-11 stores here but more concentrated, with a couple on the same block). It isn't quite the same as the ones in Hawaii- there's tons of Las Vegas souvenirs and LV themed chocolates, , for instance. This is the one of the first ones to pop up here- \""the 9th island\"" as they say. But, if you go to Hawaii and you forget a few things for your family or friends, you can get the chocolates here; it won't be as cheap, but it will do just fine (especially with the luggage fees and all- if you find that you are short on room/space in your bags because you've shopped too much). \n\nThe staff is nice and helpful. It's always well-stocked and clean. Too bad, we just can't get the pancake mix since it was discontinued (sending over to LV, I mean). But whenever we're at this mall, we stop by and browse."
3;This place is small and the wait time is horrendous \nI am writing this review as we wait for our food\nIt is now 9 53pm\nAfter waiting since 8 30 we still have not gotten one plate of food\n\n1. Ga pow- a good portion of meat and the texture of the pork was tender and not gritty. White rice compliments the dish perfectly, but on it's own can be a little too salty\n2. Pad Kee Mow- very flavorful dish with tender noodles and meat. My only complaint about this dish is that there wasn't enough noodles in proportion to the rest of the dish\n3. Short rib fried rice- so tasty but again a little on the salty side. But if you mix some white rice with it and add some thai chilies the dish is great.\n4. Pad Thai- it was a little too tangy and where were the peanuts? I love the peanuts normally on this dish. I felt a little sad that it wasn't what I expected\n5. Mango Sticky Rice-Delish!! The rice wasn't too sweet or too sticky but where's the mango?! Such a small portion of mango for $6.50....can't you charge $7 and give me more mango???\n\nWaiter Dino was very nice\nWhen he noticed we were waiting for a while he made sure to let us know \nThe girl in the front seemed snooty but after we talked her up a bit she was a tad more friendly...and by tad I mean I wasn't going to pull her hair from behind just to be like, who did that?! \n\nAnyways, this place was good\nCome when u aren't hungry\nBc by the time you get the food you will be starving \nGood tactic Le Thai... Touch\u00e9
3;Yummy true soul food! I always get the vegetable plate when I go because I can't choose between the many (all amazing) sides. The collared greens are the best I've ever had! Everything is salty, but that's expected at soul food restaurants. Mert's is always crowded, but you're usually seated quickly. Quickness of service always depends on the server. Seating is pretty close to other tables, but not a biggie. My biggest turn-off is downtown parking...you have to park in a parking garage and walk to the restaurant. Still a favorite of mine!
3;I was shocked to see the lower ratings for this restaurant. I found it interesting and refreshing. \n\nThe live music is a nice touch to the delicious food that they serve. I do think that the band is in an awkward place, because its blaring at you the minute you walk in the door, and people are standing around to watch them while making it very crowded and difficult to enter. \n\nI have gotten the seafood, which is seasoned and very good. The macoroni is really good, and the collard greens are amazing! \n\nThe decor is very modern, and cool. I love this place, and will be a regular, BUT, (there is always a but) - the service is very average. The wait staff seems nice enough, but they often disappear and leave a feeling of abandonment. \n\nOtherwise, the food and the entertainment is worth it!
4;Store supports disabled workers with opportunities to work part-time.  Very good customer service, and caring management.
4;You have to do this at least once in your life.  The best Sunday party in Vegas is Rehab, a massive all day pool party at the Hard Rock Hotel pool.  Get in early because the lines are very long, or just stay at the Hard Rock and bypass the lines.  I saw several celebs while there including some of the cast of American Gladiators, Torrie Wilson from the WWE, and my friends said he recognized a rapper that was there with his crew, but I can't remember the name.  Think dancing, crazy splashing in a massive pool with the hottest music blasting all day.  In the mood to be lazy?  You can sit out on the chairs and soak up some son or rent one of the cabanas or the King sized canopy beds not far away from the pool.  There are ridiculously beautiful people everywhere you look so if you are conscious about yourself, probably not the best place to go.
1;Hubby and I went to this cafe for breakfast.    We did enjoy the scarce amount of food we did get.   Your unable to get a free refill of coffee unless you pay a dollar more.    Coffee was almost $3.00.     Overall it's not worth a $30.00 breakfast.    They need to lower their prices.
2;2.5-3.  I can't decide which.  The check-in lines were hugely disorganized and there was a random pill (yup, a unmarked PILL) on my friend's bed when we stayed there.  We picked it because we wanted a cheaper place that was within a reasonable walking distance to Mandalay Bay for a concert (because MB is too expensive).  So this place did the job.  We walked to Excalibur and caught the tram.  MC has nice decor and the BRAND Steakhouse we ate at was pretty good, but if I wasn't so cheap, I'd have stayed at a different place.
4;I LOVE this thrift store! By far the best thrift store ever, and I have been in a lot of them. Yes, it could be a little cleaner, but it's large, and well organized. I have to bring an extra suitcase when I visit my Mom, and sometimes need to ship items of clothing and shoes home! I find jeans, shorts, tops, and shoes, all with brand names and stylish. Sometimes I feel as if the items are a little pricey, then think of how much the item was when it was brand new, and can see why it's priced as it is. I could spend hours in this store!
4;New management has turned this place around. If you can get past the out-dated decor. You are in for a treat! Huge portions, diner style food, friendly service all super quick! This must be why there's always a ton of cars in the parking lot!!!
2;This would have been a four star review if a few things would have been better. We never had a hot shower in the 3 days there. Water turned all the way to hot was barely lukewarm. When we called to complain they asked if we let the water run for 15 minutes---unacceptable. The fridge was missing a leg so was wobbly.  \nRoom was extremely spacious and comfortable with a large sofa and a higher qualify tv. The bed was comfortable and had a wonderful  sleep on it. The room was a bit noisy as we had traffic noise despite being on 19th floor. Wifi was included in resort fee which made the $28.00 somewhat palatable despite pools being closed for winter.
3;I highly recommend Village Runner. They have knowledgable staff and good selection of top brands. Bonus they have Wednesday night running with occasional raffle and discounts if you attend running group. \n\nWhen I started running VR hooked me up with some New Balance, after analyzing my stride. Those shoes allowed me to complete a three mile run without anymore shin or knee pain. Turns out I had wrong shoes, who knew just going to Nike Outlet and buying shoes wouldn't work? My runner friend said, go get the right shoes and turned me on to VR. \n\nWhile there I was invited to group run. Now I go often. Met some great people and that run helps keep me motivated and running. Enjoy the runners discount by going to group run as well, which is pretty nice. \n\nAfter I lost weight and the New Balance didn't feel right they recommended some Asics and I've worn those since. \n\nI love VR. Hope to see you Wednesday night, 6pm in winter, 6:30 in summer.
2;My dress was beautiful, awesome, loved the style loved the dress....\nStaff is OK....would not go head over heels raving about them...The russian girl, if you can and want to get your alterations done there make sure you get her!!!!!\n\nFirst off I got the dress home 3 days prior, the night before my wedding I tried it on just to make sure everything looked great, well when my dads GF was tying the bustle, 3 of the 13 ribbons this lady sewed on came off!!!! OMG, I was a mess. Up at 5:30 am rushing my dress to demetrios..waited outside until they opened. Told them the Bustle had already broke and that I needed them to fix it and that I didnt care if they tied twine or rope under it just make sure it didnt break again. They assured me it wouldnt....\n\nRushing all around the dress was ready 2 hours before my ceremony start time...dress was down for the ceremony. Went in my room to have sis and mom tie the bustle up. 13 ribbons this lady wanted them to tie. Ribbons were flying everywhere the dress looked ridiculous but it stayed for the minute...I was happy and darted out to see my new hubby....\nBout 10 minutes later, nightmare...half the dress was hanging on the floor...I looked down and then looked at my mom in fear...thank god my mom had those detachable bra straps which she ended up tying the entire dress with and then roping it around my wrist....CLASSY!!!  I had to return the dress to be fixed but it was too late- my wedding was over. \nI told them I wanted the money back for my alterations and that I wanted Demetrios to make it right with me and give me the dress at cost for ruining my wedding day. They gave me a whopping $500.00 on a dress that I paid in total $3000.00 for....\nI am not thrilled that I will never be able to wear it again.\nI am not thrilled they wouldnt give me more than $500 back....\nI came with picture and video proof of me sitting down my entire wedding.  Didnt even get to utilize the dancing lessons we spent a ton of money on..Pretty much spent the entire night sitting around watching my friends dance because the floor was so dirty and the dress was still dragging....\n\nBumb deal. Wish Demetrios would have tried harder to make this right knowing how much I spent there and how bad the dress made my day.\nSo now I have an awesome dress with a bustle that gave me hell my entire wedding day.\n\nBe careful about t his place, they talk you into the dress....they give you a price, but by the third alteration they want full payment. They then go into how they charge almost $300 for alterations and then they charge again to have it steamed and pressed...\n\nThey gave me a low budget bag. I had to go get it professionally cleaned just so I could store it the correct way for years to come.
1;I was so excited to book at Monte Carlo because my uncles had stayed there last year during the Mexican Independence day. So, I arrived Sunday afternoon and all the sheets were ripped and the restroom was so dirty. The tub had tons of hairs and had mold. This was suppose to be a 4 star hotel however it was more like a 2 star hotel. The only sort of luxurious part of the hotel is the lobby. It is definetly not worth the money you are paying.
3;I'm a total fan of this store. I always find good DVDs and the staff to be very helpful. I only had one bad disc and they exchanged it without a receipt which I thought was super nice.
3;i went to this place last week with my sister and two other people who have never tried Indian food, and we all loved it. We had the Indian sampler for $30 and the Vertical Vindaloo and it was all delicious. The sampler, one other entree and extra order of naan was enough for the 4 of us. The service was also great. I definitely would recommend this place to anyone who wanted to try Indian or even just something different.
0;I bought tickets to a Deadmau5 concert in advance by two weeks and was then held in line for two hours with people whom had no tickets. The management holds people in line for ransom like slaves waiting to be paid off by frustrated club goers in order to guarantee entrance to their club. I will never come back here... To this club... To this casino... Or to this hotel. Pissed and still waiting!
4;I'm really happy we found Velveteen Rabbit while visiting Las Vegas. When one thinks of Vegas, flashing fluorescent lights, neon signs, and tawdrily attired drunks probably comes to mind. And rightly so, there is a time and a place for that particular brand of mental obliteration. But if you want to escape all that, and spend time in a quality lounge with ambient mood lighting while sipping on some of the tastiest cocktail drinks,  - Velveteen Rabbit is THE destination. I tried a little of everything on the menu - I recommend the celery-based drink and their version of a whiskey sour. They use cinnamon oil in the whiskey sour and it's truly amazing! The decor is unique, every chair and couch is different but still reminiscent of the Victorian era, and you can tell a lot of thought was put into each detail. A small, upholstered green chair here, a whimsical bird cage hanging from the ceiling there, it's all in the details. The service was also impeccable, everything you'd expect from a high-class joint, without the obnoxious prices you'd find elsewhere in Las Vegas. I highly recommend this place! A hidden gem! Will not disappoint!
0;No stars for me we received the menu from one of the employees walking my neighborhood and thought we would try it, wrong move.  We ordered 3 meals and 2 appetizers egg rolls, bad, to be delivered.  Chicken with pineapple had raw peppers canned pineapple and some kind of sauce.  Beef and snow peas had snow peas that had bruises and brown spots and not from cooking meat was bad.  Paper wrap chicken looked as if they had picked it up from the floor and wrapped it in foil.  Very very unhappy called and spoke to them on the phone they really did not want to hear it and hung up.  STAY AWAY I should have driven the food back to them and asked for a refund.  They must have been run out of China if they served this food.
1;Run of the mill Walmart. Bad service, lacking in open registers, long lines that take forever, rude customers but the shelves are decently stocked with what I need when I go. Would much rather be at Target but the good deals and location being so close to home is hard to beat.
4;We accidentally found this place and had no idea what Shabu Shabu was,  Well we found out its delicious and the restaurant was wonderful.  \nIt's now one of our favorite places to dine.
4;The food was excellent. Salsa is great and portions will not let you down. The owners and employees are very friendly.
0;Bad Energy. \n\nI try to support local business and really wanted to like this place, but in the 6-7 times I have been there I have yet to feel like they haven't seen me as a burden on their day. I don't know what it is - it may be because I usually have my well mannered 2 year old daughter with me and they aren't overly kid friendly. They don't have highchairs and claim it is because of some restaurant code (I go to restaurants, I see high chairs...). I have had other friends with and without kids in the neighbor share similar experiences . I just heard they implemented a no stroller policy (not confirmed).   I don't want kids screaming and running around when I am eating either, but address it if and when it happens and don't have a smarmy sign up that says unattended kids will be given espresso.\n\nOther than that:\n\nNice clean design, they added a couch and some comfy chairs recently, I think that helped. \n\nTheir sandwiches are lacking, but I really like their chocolate croissants and pop tart knockoffs - almost gave them 2 stars for the croissants, but can't get past the lack of customer service. \n\nCoffee is not great, but they do sell the Cokes that Earthfare sells as Mexican Coke - I think it has real sugar as opposed to high fructose corn syrup - that is good, but I can get that at Earthfare.
2;the food is average and the service is  extremely fast. the food came so fast that i didn't get to enjoy a few sips of wine. ive came to this  restaurant many times just because its open 24 hours and amile or so from my house. if it wasnt for that, id probably would never go. the customer service is the worst ive ever experienced.
2;"Hubby and I went with our friends last Saturday night and had a very nice, relaxing meal (despite our waitress trying to hurry us along)!  The spring salad was a plateful of spring greens and herbs with a bit of shaved parmesan and potato crisps on top, nice and refreshing but hardly worth $10 a plate.  Hubby had the seafood sampler (scallop, salmon and crabcake) and was totally impressed, I had the swordfish; and although the portion was not large, it was tasty and I was filled.  Our friends both had fillets, and thought they were delicious.  Food cost was not outrageous for the quality--I thought all plates were fairly priced.  The alcohol, however, was overpriced as usual--but that did not stop us from drinking!  ;-)  I had the $10 wine, not the $15 margarita!"
1;There are only a few good things to say about the dinner at Lupo. The service was reasonable and the wine glass portions were more like 1.5 or 2 glass portions, but at the price of about a glass.\n\nUnfortunately, the food wasn't very good. I feel like any top chef can come into a city and put his stamp on a restaurant and feel free to charge whatever he wants.\n\nOur spaghetti was just OK, and the prosciutto on our pizza was a bit stiff, and as such, unappetizing.\n\nWhile Lupo isn't horrible, there are much better places to go for the price.
3;I had only been to Timo once before for drinks, but finally had the opportunity to go for a favorite Yelper's birthday brunch a few months ago.\n\nWe had two large tables, and the servers were able to keep up beautifully.  The mimosa flight was a great deal with glasses of orange, grapefruit, and cranberry.  The grapefruit was my favorite.  Damn it!  I'm not supposed to have grapefruit.  Oh well, it was worth it.  I also hesitatingly ordered the crab cake benedict.  The last time I tried this at another restaurant, the crab cake tasted more like a fish patty.  Not at Timo, it was perfect.  Well, the yoke was maybe a tad overcooked, but that's okay with me.\n\nI would happily return for brunch again!
1;Had a buy one get one free coupon and it was during the day... so it only cost around $10.... but we waited in line for about 30 min., only to go to a small observation deck. It was an impressive view, but one that could be obtained from a hotel window. \n\nIf you have a coupon and some free time it may be enjoyable. However, this is something you could skip. Spend the time just walking around the Paris hotel lobby.... as I found that more exciting and it cost nothing.
2;Just ok.  Meat wasn`t juicy, and I found I was adding a lot of mustard while eating it.  The bread with the `sandwich` seemed superflous since it was too small to contain any meat inside it anyways.\n\nAlso, I think I just paid $1.75 plus tax for a large pickle.
2;This airport is kinda deceitful. From the outside, and even inside the terminals it looks modern, clean, and inviting. That all changes the moment you need to excuse yourself to the restroom.\n\nHands down the nastiest restroom I saw the whole time I was in Vegas, like seriously. I am pretty sure there was even a glory hole in one of the stalls. Unless you are into that kinda thing, you are probably better off holding it in.\n\nThe TSA line was also frustrating. They flagged three pax carry-ons in front of me for additional screening, but they would only screen one bag at a time. I stood there, with my backpack in the xray scanner giving it a nice radiation bath for over 15 minutes while they meticulously went through a sorority chicks lacey panties and grampa joes dentures and woodworking mags. They refused to carry on until the other luggage had been screened, even though mine was in the machine and fine.\n\nThey do have an American Express lounge and a handful of fast food joints. Oh, and do yourself and your wallet a favor and STAY AWAY FROM THE SLOTS IN THE AIRPORT!
4;"The food quality is so consistent at Portillo's and the Tempe location is no exception. Went with coworkers and they all really enjoyed it and said they'd be back. I had the Italian sausage sandwich with sweet and hot peppers dipped and it was outstanding. I recommended the combo sandwich to one of the first timers and he loved it. Other great reviews at the table for the beef sandwich, fries, onion rings and chocolate cake shake. \""I don't remember ever having to chew a shake before, but this is awesome!\"""
0;This store has a lot of toys.   Apparently toy shopping is so important these days that the store has to be open at 9pm on Thanksgiving day.   I am completely in awe at the depths of stupidity this nation has fallen to and this store is leading the way.   We shop here when looking for children's gifts.   It isn't the best store for atmosphere and so not the most fun place to shop in the first place.  Anyway, we won't be going here ever again since they are opening on a holiday.  If they didn't have this policy I would give them three stars with one star being for keeping their store hours away from the holiday out of respect for their employees.  If they treat their employees this way imagine how much they care about their customers.
4;one word...amazing!!!!
4;I went through the drive through around 10 am this morning.  Fastest drive through service ever,  tasty coffee.  I highly recommend pumpkin spice coffee during the fall.
2;Another failed attempt to find good Pad Thai in Madison. The summer rolls are good, but for the most part the food is bland. I eat thai food for the richness in flavors and the sauces here just don't cut it.
1;We were at Caesars Forum shops because we had to buy a gift and of course we got hungry along the way.  We were in the mood for some Italian so it was either Spagos or Trevi.  We walked past spagos and didn't feel like mingling with a bunch of senior citizens so we decided to roll with Trevi.\n\nTook about 20 minutes to get us seated.  Tip...you want to be around in case they call your name before your approximate time.  They move through the list pretty quickly.  Two calls then onto the next.\n\nWe like to order something very basic when we go to a new restaurant.  If they cannot get the basic menu items down, we really don't have an interest in returning.  So we ordered the Calamari for app.  I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs and my wife ordered the chopped Italian Salad.  The calamari was a little on the bready side and the sauce was ok.  Nothing extraordinary.  The spaghetti was ok as well.  I can't say it tasted horrible.  But there's nothing really special about it.  My wife liked her chopped salad.\n\nAt the end of the day, we spent approx $70 for food that is worth about $30. So the food is 3 star worthy, but the price knocked it down a star. I guess they have to find a way to pay the lease at Caesars!
1;All i can say is what happened to this place!!\nI use to visit this location years ago when i lived in el paso and now this place has multiplied and the food quality has gone way low!
2;It is what it is!  It is still cheaper to mail stuff here than it is with UPS and FedEx, so they are doing something right! \n\nThis post office is ok.  It is big and has a lot of room to wait in line, which you will be doing, which makes the wait in line a little better.  It makes it less claustrophobic like many of the older locations around town where you feel like you are in a cattle car.   There is always a line here though, no matter what time of day you come., so always give yourself some extra time when you stop by.  They never have all of the windows open for some reason, which slows everything down.  They also recently removed the stamp machine, so now everyone needing stamps have to wait in line as well, which also adds to the line length.  \n\nThere is a self service machine for mailing smaller, regular packages, which is really quite nice.  You can get in and out quickly if you don't need to talk to a desk agent.  This is a huge plus for me, since I rarely need a desk agent.  I am a DIY kinda girl, so I just love it!\n\nAnother plus is the huge parking lot.  The post office by my mom has about 15 spots, so having 100 or so is nice, especially if you are mailing a lot of items.\n\nOverall, it is a decent location.
4;"So I was doing an Elvis renewal while we had some friends in town and I was trying to create a whole Vintage-Vegas day.  Well, there's not a lot of authentic vintage left in this town, so we settled for fabricated vintage instead.  Luckily someone I know started talking about this place and it piqued my interest.  After further research on Yelp, I was sold.\n\nThe idea for Capo's is that you are in a speakeasy from the 1930's.  Back entryways, secret doors, dim lighting... it all makes for a fun and interesting atmosphere.  Our friends were especially impressed since we surprised them with our restaurant selection.\n\nWhen you get into the restaurant, be prepared for the dim lighting- they really aren't kidding here.  It was still daylight outside when we got to the restaurant and it took my eyes several minutes to adjust.  But they keep the idea fun and even give you little flashlights on your menu to help you read it if necessary.\n\nThe seating is posh and comfortable and I love the chandeliers above every table.  The tables are large enough for a party of four (like ours) to have a good time, but still intimate enough for all you Romeos out there.  At 6 o'clock they have a singer that performs old Sinatra songs and the like.  He was a great guy that not only sang well, but also chats up the diners and later dedicates songs to them.  My girlfriend and I had \""Unforgettable\"" dedicated to us.  Needless to say, I felt pretty special.\n\nAs for the meal, they start you off with bread and garlic butter.  The butter was tasty, but like other reviewers said the bread hardens up pretty quickly.  Not really sure how this is possible, but it's true.  It's not inedible but just not as yummy as when they first bring it out.\n\nThe salads were great and vinaigrette dressing was delicious.  The veggies were fresh and I loved the little artichoke heart they throw in for good measure (but I'm a sucker for artichokes).\n\nI ordered the Vodka Penne and it was so good I'm still thinking about it.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce had a lot of flavor.  I was very happy with my entree.\n\nTwo others in my party ordered the pasta with alfredo and another ordered the stuffed chicken.  Everyone else said their entrees were good, but I don't think they liked them as well as I liked mine.\n\nOur waitress was fantastic- super friendly and checked up on us just enough.  She was also more than happy to bring out a special cake that our friends had made for us and even lit a candle on it.  The other employees we met were really friendly as well.\n\nThe few cons:\n-bread could be better and perhaps a couple of entrees as well\n-for how nice the dining area is, the bathroom made me a little sad\n-I didn't like walking through a smokers lounge to get back outside\n-it was too warm in the restaurant- not sure if the air was broken or they were going for the speakeasy atmosphere, but the temperature needed to be turned down about 5 degrees (and I'm always cold, so you know it has to be warm for me to say something)\n-the food is a little overpriced\n\nI'm going with five stars since this was overall a very memorable experience for me.  Between the employees, the singer, the food, and the atmosphere I definitely have plans to come back."
3;love this place. burgers are awesome. fries are somewhat greasy which is somewhat gross but ill still eat them. love how they have a secret menu and every time i order something off the secret menu the employees know what im talking about and dont look at me like i just made something stupid up. could be bigger inside and have more seating. the fries come with a good amount of salt on them so adding more salt probably isnt a good idea. like how when it gets busy an employee comes out to each car in the drive through line waiting and takes your order. place can get crowded during lunch and dinner time so come early or later for lunch if you dont want to wait forever for your meal. like how in the drive through area you can see inside the building and watch the employees make the food.
4;A unique and interesting restaurant which embrases the charm of an old home and gives it a modern and urban touch.  This restaurant boasts a large variety of unique pizza combinations.  Our group of 14 tested 6 of these and all six were fabulous...leaving even the most non-adventerous food eaters in our group shocked that they enjoyed each one.  I'd highly recommend the the pizza with asian pears... it was fabulous!!
4;Strawberry coconut mojito, pork tacos, and churros are amazing.
4;History on display! Love it!
0;Won't be going back....my sister who usually cuts my hair saw how bad of a job it was. A hair person herself, pointed out the simple little things.....won't be going back plain n simple.
0;Horrible snobby service. Took forever. Just wanted a drink with a coworker on a great looking terrace while visiting Canada. Decided not to eat there even after we read reviews of other experiences.
0;"The biggest eyesore that stands out and makes this review a 1 star and not higher is the royal screw-up during check-in.  I distinctly answered \""NO\"" to leaving my card open to having incidentals charged to my card.  Well guess what?  Christian, who checked us in, apparently thought it better and took it upon himself to leave it open.  T.I. put a hold of $500 on my card.  This is similar to a security deposit when you rent a car.  My card had a \""reservation\"" placed on it and because stupid me used my debit instead of credit, my bank red-flagged my account due to suspected fraud and blocked it from further charges.  I found out the hard way with my card being declined the next day.  Thanks a lot, Christian!  Went down the next day to get it straightened out and they apologized and made the correction, but three days later my bank still hasn't released the hold.  I'm not blaming my bank for the hold still pending, but this all would've been adverted if directions would have been folllowed and a simple keystroke would've been correctly punched!\n\nEverything else about T.I. was satisfactory and I would probably be rating it 3 stars if it were not for the mishap with check-in.  The deal we got was actually a steal: $45 for Sun night and $40 for Mon night with 2 free buffet coupons each day.  Although the free buffet coupon was only good Mon - Fri.  Buffet, ehhh.  Still, the rates themselves were great.  The Sirens show is temporarily close until after Christmas, but judging from reviews for that, didn't miss out.  Pool was closed, but it's friggin' 50 outside at this time so who'd be swimming?  So, wouldn't you think they'd ease up on the $20 resort fee????\n\nFound parking close to the hotel entrance rather easily each time.  The tram between T.I. and the Mirage, though a very short distance, was really convenient.  Rooms are clean and tidy; modernized and doesn't look dated at all.  Nothing gross that can be seen (don't want to break out the black light, though!)  Slept sound and comfortably each night.  Nice view of the strip overlooking the Venetian across the street - ho hum, maybe shoulda stayed across the street..."
2;good place if the price is right its centrally located and it has the best sushi restaurant KOI
1;"2 stars becauses the food is fantastic. We had the champagne brunch today, and it was great. The best desserts, great meats and awesome seafood. \n\nWe were dissapointed, however, by our waitresses behavior. \n\nAs we were getting up to leave, our server saw us and walked over. She picked up our check and loudly asked us if we needed change, which we did not. Keep in mind you pay for everything before you eat here. Then she said \""I didn't see anything on the check.\"" It became obvious she was asking for a tip. As we left and were not walking out, she sarcastically told us to havbe a great day. Extremely rude and not acceptable when you are paying close to $50 a person for a weekend lunch."
4;I saw Christine's review and had to throw in my 2 cents.\n\nI love the Humane Society.  I found my first dog at the 13th and Hatcher campus and couldn't have been happier with the service and the dog.\n\nWhen we adopted our second dog from a sick friend, we knew that we had to get this little girl fixed.  When she was old enough, we took her to the Dobbins campus and had her spayed.  The employees were incredibly nice and comforting and our little Layla recovered pretty quickly from the surgery.  And it only cost $60 which is phenomenal if you check with private vets.  They do it all the time, so they are pros at it.
4;I almost want to give this place 1 star just so the craps tables won't be so packed when I go back, but I won't.\n\nIt's simple. If you're a pimp, you play craps. If you ain't 'cause you not then you play one of those other sorry ass grandpa table games, but this is why I'm hot. I'm not going to write about those other noob games because my sack isn't hanging down to my knees yet AKA I'm still young and ballin' like Spaldin'. If you do play those other sorry ass grandpa table games then get yo' ass to the MGM where all of the other old people go to die. I play craps because my boner is strong.\n\nCasino Royale has awesome craps because it has low minimums and high odds. If you are not loaded with mommy and daddy money then this is most def ideal place to play some craps if you want to make some money, talk shit to people playing on the dark side (don't pass line), and getting fucked up on White Russians, Jack and Cokes, and brews.\n\nI swear, 90% of the time this baller throws the dice (noob.yelp.com), he hooks everyone and their moms up with cash money. God, I love myself.\n\nKOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOBE! Get $$$!\n\n\nP.S. if you're looking to find slam pieces then def don't come here. Your boner will die within 2 minutes of walking through the front door.\n\nP.P.S. watch yourself on  your White Russian consumption. I almost deuced myself after the 4th one last time and had to switch to whiskey. It might've been the milk they were using or maybe it had to do with me making so much God damn money.\n\nOH NO YOU DI'INT!...\n\n...why yes, I did!
1;"You come because you want to acquire bragging rights and say you've eaten here; however, there's nothing to brag about. The overpriced food is comparable to Denny's, it's crowded, the wait for the food is egregiously long and service was ok. At least I hung out with my friends. Go to the Cheesecake Factory inside the Forum Shops instead."
0;"If I could give zero stars I would! What a pretentious establishment!  They had empty seats and saved them for \""important people\"" this is a whole bunch of crap!I would not recommend yhus establishment to my worst enemy! \nHorrible service!\nHorrible mojitos, my dog could make a better drink!\nThis place sucks!\nMike at the door fkat out told me he had important people coming. I stood there like a stooge bought 2 over priced drinks along with my entire party..watched them smoke over priced crappie cigars from their shop...the while time 4 tables sat empty.  Finally we were sick of spending our hard earned money at this s... h...! Don't waste your money!"
0;We are done. Many of the office staff are incompetent in their job. As the other stated NO ONE ever calls you back and have sent prescriptions to a pharmacy I have never used causing confusion and frustration.  Dr. Imas I hope that if you read this you enjoyed the comic book my husband gave you and we enjoyed you as a docotr. But I sit here today never to return after the incident that took place this morning. I cancel my morning appointment and am just waiting to take my medical records else where. To bad your a great docotr with mediocre front office staff.
0;Let me start by saying I dream about Paciugo. I don't spend much time on State St anymore but after a mediocre date night dinner at another restaurant I was excited to get my gelato on. I didn't realize that it was no longer Paciugo until I walked in an recognized nothing. \n\nMy favorite part of Paciugo was being able to get more than one flavor. The employee working didn't seem to want to be there, the case was half full, and nothing really sounded good. I finally choose a plain dark chocolate option (my previous gelato go to) and was satisfied with my first bite. From there I quickly felt my teeth feel chalky, as if I had just guzzled a whole bottle of Pepto. Needless to say I didn't finish my expensive single flavor cup and my boyfriend couldn't handle more than a bite of it. We won't be back.
0;I'm very upset with University Dermatology. They sent my bill to a wrong address (it ended up with a neighbor since it was a digit off) and then sent it to collections before talking to me. I payed the bill with collections, only to receive a notice from the office later that I could no longer receive care from them because of the late payment. Completely unprofessional! When I called the office to explain that when I did eventually receive my bill it had a mis-typed address, they were rude to me and didn't care that I was paying collections to fix an issue that wasn't even my fault. I didn't write the wrong address on my paperwork, your staff needs to be careful about missing numbers. Now I have to find a new dermatologist, since they won't see me anymore.
0;"I am so so so glad that I am no longer in the care of this Family Practice office. Each time I would go in for an appointment they were running hours, I'm talking 2+ hours behind. Once I was late less than 10 minutes and they threw a fit. \nNow that I live out of state, all I'm trying to do is get a copy of my records. It seems to be rocket science to them. On hold for over 20 minutes with an intermitten \""thanks for holding how can I you?\"" from different people. This is INSANE!  \n\nWhen I finally get somone on the phone I'm asked if I need all my records. I said yes. So they tell me since I need my whole medical record, it cost $10 to get my records on a CD. I went there twice. I can't imagine my records being more than a couple pages. I asked if for the $10 I can get my son's on the same CD. Nope. We were both there a total of 4 times - combined. This place is so completely disorganized and the front office staff is completely aloof to the patient's needs.\n\n If I moved back to Mesa and this was the last medical office on earth, I would go die  in the gutter. I wish I could take the one star I had to give them, to write the review, back. They don't even deserve that!"
1;I only go to a BW3 if a friend insists.\n\nThey have Happy hour beer prices and some happy hour food offerings.  We happened to be there on 60\u00a2 wing night.  We asked for the wings extra crispy and they were.\n\nI am pretty sure they charged extra for ranch and blue cheese - which that is cheesy!  We had an order of 20 wings and we got a tiny plastic cup of ranch and 1 tiny cup of blue cheese.  \n\nThe happy hour special were mini corn dogs, chili con queso dip (that's chili and chese dip) and onion rings.  I do enjoy greasy bar food, but  I could have done better at 7-11.  \n\nWith the happy hour prices you really are just paying fair prices.  Basically, you get a discount on there overly inflated prices.\n\nHats off to the BW3's marketing and advertising team.  You are able to fill up a huge restaurant serving shitty overpriced food with bad service in a down economy. \n\nThey get one extra star for the variety of sports on TV's everywhere.
2;The pancakes are the best in the world.  Good food. It's a little pricey for what it is though...  You are paying tourist prices.  They DO NOT have locals special prices.  Too bad.
4;"I've been in town for 32 years now and first was recommended to Ted Wiens in the early 1980's when they were downtown. At that time, they offered to 'knerl' the front spindles on my 1950 Chevy Pick-up to save me replacing them. It is that type of \""save the customer money\"" that is still alive and well at this location at Decatur and Rancho. When you go, ask for Randy. He is the type of honest, hardworking mechanic that you just don't find everywhere. I've followed Randy thru a couple shops in our area in the last 10 years and now he is at Ted Wiens, Decatur and Rancho. I hope he stays here ! !  But if he doesn't...I'll track him down again. He is that good ! !"
1;"Okay, like the saying goes... bigger is not always better.\n\nThis is a freeeeaaakkiiiiiinnnnn' GINORMOUS store. I went here to meet two of my friends, and boy... was this a fun time looking for them, NOT. The music is pretty loud, so you can't hear your cellphone ring.\n\nI saw about a hundred associates \""working\"" there... a.k.a. walking around aimlessly, taking the escalator up &down, talking to each other. I think only one person actually asked if i needed help in the whole 2 hours I was there. She was helpful and pointed me in the direction of the shoe section.\n\nThere is a lot of clothing being double- or even triple-shown. There's actually not that much selection, just a lot of the same stuff. \n\nI don't care much for Forever21 anyway, because the quality just doesn't meet my expectations... I could probably find some pieces in Chinatown with a lot more detail for about the same price and comparable quality. \n\nBig ups for having a bathroom inside the store though.. well, obviously, it was the old Macy's...but Lord knows, girls and their bladders just don't hold up like mens' do."
1;Boba places are a dime a dozen but for some reason this one seems to be more popular than others. Maybe it's the location? Or the abundance of seating compared to others? The drinks themselves are  good, but not amazing enough to rave about. However, the service here is horrible. I've probably been here a dozen times to meet with friends (always their choice) and every time it's bad. After they get you your drinks, they pretty much forget you ever existed. It's also poorly staffed as they only have 1 or 2 people serving drinks on a Saturday night. I'd recommend going else where.
2;The view from the Mix lounge is terrific, and the ride up in the glass elevator is also very fun. The restaurant ambiance is also very nice with a glass bubble chandelier hanging from the center and panoramic views. However, it is still casual. The furniture has started to look a bit worn, or maybe we were seated in a bad corner which was right by the server desk.\nThere was some complementary bread as a starter, we weren't very hungry so we ordered the entrees directly. They were excellent - Brown Butter Cod and the Mediterranean Rib meat Lamb with Eggplant Lasagna. It was a great combination of flavors. We did not want dessert but the server brought us some complementary fresh baked madeleines with chocolate. It was nice but too sweet for my taste. \n\nService was ok, our bread and water server was much friendlier than our main server who was just stiffly polite. It seems like the service is variable.\n\nIt's a nice restaurant but a little pricey overall and I would probably check out some other restaurants in Mandalay Bay like Fleur and Aureole next.
2;Who doesn't think all gas station quick marts should have Mexican takeout counters in them?  Raise your hands.  \n\nSeeing this place on TV, we knew we had to go when we were in town recently, and not only did we go, we went directly from picking up our rental car.  We ordered carne asada and a few other things.  Food comes in a styrofoam takeout container with rice and refried beans.  Menudo is only served on Saturdays (thank god it was Wednesday--yuck).  While I was thrilled to see the horchata and hibiscus flower drink machines, the counterperson sadly told me that they were out of it because...they couldn't find their delivery person.  Huh?  Whatever, I had iced coffee.\n\nThere are tables set up in a reasonable space to the left of the rest of the convenience store, with some bistro tables by the window.  Portions are on the small size, with the exception of the flour tortilla that comes with your meal that is enormous.  The carne asada and the other stuff was a little tough, a little flavorless, and probably not worth the excitement in our opinion.  However , we both felt that we would happily try some other things before rendering a final opinion.  Perhaps the burritos or enchiladas are more toothsome.  \n\nThe whole place is a riot, with people enjoying themselves and their food and everyone talking about how it had been on Food Network.  I think Guy Fieri is an oaf, so that doesn't mean much to me--the quirk factor is in full force here, so come if you're in the area.
1;It's ok. Had no choice to eat here since we were running late for our show, Ka, and this was the only place you could eat right away. I forget how much dinner was, but somewhere around the $25 range. You can buy a bottle of merlot for $15 outside as well (a pretty good deal).  I had tons of food, but then again, it's buffet food. I wish they had more soups to choose from. I felt like the soup was leftovers in some creamy sauce.\n\nThe part I did like, was the mini bites of desserts. So smart to have them bite-sized so you don't waste it. The carrot cake and key lime pie were good.
0;I was so incredibly disappointed.  I love gourmet food, and I thought I was going to get some pretty good, gourmet italian.  I had to wait over an hour for my reservation, our water was never refilled, and the food was very over-priced.  I paid almost $30 for the ribeye steak which was the worst ribeye I have ever had.  If you want ribeye, go to Jim Gould's.  Their mashed potatoes were very much like the kind you make from a box.  After I ate there, I went to kofusion for dessert.. it was THAT bad.  It is also so small.  There are not even 10 tables in that restaurant, and I can not even believe they are still in business.  I was so pissed after eating here, that this restaurant is the reason I made an account on yelp.. to tell you all that it sucked.
3;Bumping this up to 4 stars. Returned here yesterday with just my husband. There were more people in, but the service was still equally attentive, without being clingy... and this time the food came out hot. \n\nThe -1 star is because they always seem to be out of something (chicken strips today), and their taco/nacho station didn't seem that good. I just ended up having a couple salads, and my burger meal. \n\nWe're supposed to go back here tonight because our friends from last week want to attend again though. Maybe they can earn that extra star back.

3;M & I tried this place while we were  out looking at houses this past weekend. At the minimum, we assumed that we'd get something to fill us up. Little did we know that we were in for a treat.\n\nThe Dogs are very good, with a natural casing that gets good & crispy when cooked. I went with the Boston - A regular dog on a soft, warm bun with SauerKraut & Spicy Mustard. Excellent portions & good flavors all around. M had an Original w/o onion. She was pleasantly surprised as well.\n\nThe staff were greta, and promptly took our order tableside and brought us our drinks. I assume that when that are busiest that you need to order at the counter and find a seat, but they appear to offer tabel service at the slower times.\n\nIf you're in the area, it's worth a stop in.
2;Very pleasant ambiance. I did'nt care much about the food but maybe it was what I ordered
0;"This place (owned by a different group of people) just opened up today, taking over what was once Sushi Hut.\n\nOh, god.\n\nThey have a roll named \""Lady GaGa.\"" Let that sink in for a few seconds. \""Lady GaGa.\"" Gives new meaning to tuck and roll, I guess.\n\nI still went through and got a katsudon--only to find out I can't actually eat it because it has onions on it (I have a food allergy) because it wasn't stated on the menu. Is this my fault? Yes and no. I should have done what everyone with food allergies should do--ask. However, I also believe it's kind of important to have that information on the menu just in case! Because food allergies aside from milk and peanuts, do, in fact, exist.\n\nIt's new, and I'm probably being way too harsh by only offering one star because maybe it's just an opening fluke--but the few bites I can take out of this that aren't covered in onion just aren't satisfying. It's tough, it's chewy, and it doesn't have a good taste at all. I'm just kind of disappointed and hungry all the way around."
0;This groomer may have good reviews but she was less than polite on the phone.\nShe is NOT taking any new clients.  I inquired why this wasn't on her website and she got huffy with me.  When I informed her that I would be putting a comment on yelp she was not happy and hung up me.  She may be good with dogs but not so much  with humans.  Ruff! Ruff!r\n\nI stand by my comments.  I used a competitor and they were fine.  The subject service is not taking clients.
2;Came here for lunch on a Thursday. Left tipsy but unimpressed.\n\nService was nice and efficient, and we were seated on the patio overlooking the strip pedestrians. We ordered a few dishes to share--the salmon tartare and the steak au pouvre. Also got a carafe of the frangria since I can't resist anything with rosemary in it. \n\nThe warm bread and salmon tartare with homemade potato chips were probably the highlight of the meal. Although that pickled thing that looks like a miniature watermelon with a long stem and lots of seeds was nasty! What is that thing!? Why do restaurants serve these little devils mixed in with the delicious cornichons?? Gross.\n\nThe frangria, sadly, left a bit to be desired. Although it was not sickeningly sweet like some sangrias, it also didn't have the depth of flavors that the description led me to believe it would have. I couldn't taste the fruits and definitely could not taste the rosemary--which made me very sad. \n\nThe steak was also just okay. The cut was so thin that even though we ordered medium rare the only part of the steak that was pink was a 1cm slice toward the middle. I like my steaks juicy and flavorful, and this place, despite all the hype about the steaks, fell short of that cut. \n\nOverall it was still a pleasant experience and sitting on the patio watching Vegas life was fun. Just don't expect the best steak of your life, and don't eat those picked-mini-watermelon-w/stems.
2;not a bad spot to stay, but they make you pay for wifi, so they get a 3.
0;I purchased a voucher from fabness  and was having trouble. I clicked the chat button and was treated to a very rude customer service rep who did not help me and just disconnected me when I asked to speak to a manager. I will never order form them again.
2;First of all and i think the most important is that this venue almost always has djs who spin either trance or house music, with very little deviation. They do have a seperate hiphop room but its very small. IMO i always check to see whose spinning at the club, if you dont like the music sorry to say this but there are other venues in vegas that are still very nice and probably easier to get into and with cheaper drinks. That being said, if you want the absolute easiest way to get in every time, especially with big name Djs, is to pre buy your ticket online via their website. The next best way is to find a promoter. The good/bad thing about this is you have to spend time setting it up, and its still up to the promoter to respond back to you and take care of you. Many times they may not be at the venue or not very good at getting back to you. Staying at the hotel usually gets you 2 free admissions per room per night, but is subject to whatever the door feels like doing that night. The Club itself has a lot of stairs, lots of stairs, be prepared to walk A LOT. drinks are typical for vegas, meaning expensive. If you drink a lot and have enough people, a table might be worth your while. Marquee dayclub is attached to the club just dont fall in the pool. The most important tip at this venue is watch anything valuable you might have with you. I had my wallet, stolen right out of my front pocket. I wasnt drunk or heavily intoxicated at that time. I was in the middle of the main floor dance floor when it happened. We searched for it on the floor but never found it. The security was very helpful in trying to find it, but to no avail. The club security and hotel security both admitted to me that they KNOW there are pick pockets who work the club and steal wallets, phones, watches, jewelry, pretty much anything that can be taken from you when you are drunk, dancing around or just packed into the venue on a busy weekend night. The next time i go back im bringing a wallet with a chain. that being said the club itself is nice, the lines can be long, if you like the music and can afford to spend the money for the drinks, its not bad. Just do what the security says and bring a taser, JK dont do that but really, buy tickets ahead of time, follow the dress code, and have fun.
2;I love the Port of Subs. I fell in love after tasting their smoky cheddar. The cheese is so creamy, a bit sharp and full of flavor. I didn't eat here much before I was a vegetarian, but have been rocking the veggie subs here since that time. \nThis location is one of the 2 locations nearest my home. This location is typically clean, but occasionally there are some sketch characters hanging around this location. Maybe its because there is a Wal-Mart next store...and I've seen my fair share of  the People of Wal-Mart website to know they usually have sketch characters shopping there :-P. \nBack to the unfortunately acronym-ed POS...I really enjoy the woman who seems to always be working here (maybe she is the owner??). She is super friendly and does not skip on the veggies. When I order a veggie sandwich, I would assume sandwich shops wouldn't skimp on the veggies, well some do, but not this one. My favorite part of any POS sandwich is the cheese. They have really good cheese. My fave is the smoky cheddar (as previously mentioned, but it  really does deserve another shout out), a close second is the provolone. The cheese here is no exception. Each and every delicious slice is laid out upon the fresh bread to make a little piece of heaven that will soon be enjoyed by my taste buds. Ok, now I am hungry. \n\nI only have 2 concerns with this Port of Subs. \n1) They close super early (7pm or 8pm depending on if they've had a dinner rush)\n2) They do not accept the Port of Subs loyalty card. Ugh! That is no fun at all.
4;I love this place.  Great spot for some basic food, yummy drinks.  Service isn't always super fast but it's not a place for fast.  Great spot to go with a friend and chill during the week.  I highly recommends the hummus and fig salad.
1;Having dined at many other Vegas buffets (the Wynn, the Paris, the Mirage, etc.) I found myself very underwhelmed. Everyone raves about the Bellagio buffet but I just kept wishing I had gone to the Wynn.\nThe decor is decent and the quality of the food is good, but there wasn't much of an assortment. I went for 4th of July brunch at around 11:30am and the sushi bar wasn't open, there was not a single pasta dish, the slice of meat I got was fatty and veiny, and our drinks took 20+ minutes to arrive.\nI will say that the fruit was fresh and yummy (melon, berries, etc.) and the desserts were good, but it wasn't enough to make me want to come back here ever again.
0;The customer service here is so terrible I couldn't recommend it to anyone.  I won't be back.  I actually paid $3 MORE on amazon for something to avoid giving Toys'r'us any money.\n\nJust despicable lack of checkers, and rude, literally rolling eyes, management.\n\nWhat can a brick and mortar store offer if not customer service?
0;this place is awful, the food is also awful.  Noisey enviroment.  definately, i will no go back .  I wish yelp would have a spot for no stars.  I would even give one!
2;This particular Chipotle varies a lot on a day to day basis and the service all kind of depends on how busy it is, which I don't fault it for. The service is that of any fast foodish place and the people try to rush you down the line as quick as possible to serve the next customer. I usually get the same thing when I go there. Chicken burrito with black beans, sour cream, cheese, and brown rice. Kind of plan, but hey, still good. \n\nOnce in awhile you get that person that doesn't quite know how to wrap a burrito and thus it falls apart easily, which makes me a little sad, but it's not really a big deal, since I generally end up eating them with a fork anyway. It's hard for me to be impressed with fast food joints because they are, well, fast food, but this place is at least pretty clean. It gets very busy at around noon though, so if you come wait until later if you have a chance. There is outdoor seating and parking usually isn't a problem to find. The service is sub-par and once and awhile they make mistakes. Nothing that good or bad about the place. Just, eh.
0;This place is horrible..... i paid for a $9 margarita that was literally salt water. The beer was room temperature. My friend and I went in for happy hour and we asked the waitress what their happy hour menu was and she told us she didn't know and told us she would get back with us on their specials and never did. Finally found the menu hidden under the old nintendo64 console and we ordered the bacon wrapped hotdog, fried ocra, and wings. The food was COLD!!! It sucks because we could've just gone to Hooters upstairs or Big Bang downstairs but we wanted to try something new and we were completley dissapointed. I HIGHLY WARN AGAINST GOING TO THIS PLACE!!! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
4;Got to this little box on the corner of a shopping plaza at around 3pm on a Wednesday afternoon. No long lines as mentioned in the other reviews. However we have made attempts before and the line gets pretty ridiculous for an establishment where you can either drive up or walk up to the window for your order. You can call in your order too but I wouldn't do that the yogurt melts pretty fast. The other reviews talked about how long it takes, I think it's well worth the wait, I think they only slice up the fruits when it is ordered hence the uber freshness . I don't think they are pre sliced and sitting in a tub wilting. \nMy 8 year old daughter placed her order first and ordered the breakfast parfait. The guy helping us told us that it would be too much for her since it was 20 oz and that we could order her  a similar item on the kids menu. Wow! Honesty so rare now a days that breakfast parfait was about $6 and the kids menu is 1.99. The kids items are the same size as Jamba Juice's kids items but WAAAaaaaaay cheaper. So she ordered a kid's yogurt and customized it with strawberries bananas and granola. I got the regular size yogurt customized it with strawberries, bananas, mango, granola and peanut butter. My boyfriend got the famous Acai bowl and my son got the kids' chocolate smoothie. All that for $14 we got the smoothie for free for no reason Yay! \nThe yogurt was not dense and tart like most yogurt. It was sweet and very ice cream like. The fruits were all firm and tasty, I don't know what brand granola or peanut butter they use but it was super delish and very different from anything I've tasted. I love that you can customize your bowls and that they have lots to chose from. I added peanut butter as an afterthought and while I was waiting I was worried how the mango and peanut butter would taste mixed together. I was also worried when I saw that the peanut butter was not blended with the yogurt it was placed on top. \nWe are regulars at Jamba Juice and yogurtland  and it takes us awhile to consume our yogurt bowls and smoothies but with Juice n Go items, we went through it pretty quick. My son killed his smoothie just from the walk from their window to our car. We were all done within our treats in less than 5 mins. Take a look around the parking lot and you see everyone leaning on their vehicle handling their yogurt/ fruit bowls .
3;Harry's was a great spot for lunch. They have really fresh food options, friendly-service, and a pleasant atmosphere.\n\nI enjoyed the crab-cake sandwich on brioche with sweet potato fries. The fries were perfectly light and crisp. The brioche was super-soft and the apple or pear (can't recall) slaw was a perfect addition to the sandwich. \n\nPriced at $13, it was at the top range for a sandwich or buger- most were $8-12 so pretty standard.\n\nI have heard from other co-workers that it can get slow- so arrive early if you're eating lunch during the work week.
0;"Maybe it was because I had a groupon that the stylist (and owner) was horrible to me- but if you don't want to spend time on people who have groupons, don't sell groupons! Duh! Anyway- he told me my hair was too short for him to do anything with. He said to let it grow two months and then come back and he could cut it, but he still sure as heck took out his texturizing shears and made a few cuts so that he could redeem the groupon. Plus, I can't be 100% certain, but when I walked in, I'm pretty sure he and his girlfriend started talking about me to each other in another language. And I clearly interrupted him doing her hair (even though I had an appointment). Altogether I was in there for 30 minutes- 10 minutes waiting, 10 minutes getting shampooed and 10 minutes \""cutting and styling.\"" Not an ice cube's chance in hell that I will ever go back."
3;Figured we'd give it a shot since I listen to him on KTAR and I like to eat at Majerles. It seems like a upscale version of sports bar food. Has a clean fun atmosphere and the staff was nice. Had a buffalo rap and 2 beers while my wife had sliders and a Bloody Mary. Bill was $42, so it wasn't that bad. We will go back for sure
3;Great restaurant! We were staying by the airport for the night and il Fornetto was the right choice. I ordered the Veal Parmigiana and started with the Fried Calmari -- both were exactly on point. The experience of sitting outside while dining here was fantastic. I would highly recommend you try this place if you're in the area. Everyone I was with enjoyed their dish! YOU SHOULD GO.
1;I came in with 6 people and ordered Chicken Sausage slider. The cups for water were all wet and looked dirty, the place also was swarmed with flies. Everyone got their food except me. So I know they might have forgot my order. I talked to the cashier girl who got my order to check if they do. She comfirmed they're making it so i continue to wait. After everyone done eating, my order still hasnt come. I checked with the cashier girl again and she finally said the kitchen staff lost my order. I gave this place 2 stars since the manager was decent enough to get my order to-go with an extra apple pie and get me a refund as I demanded. I highly doubt that I would ever come back here again.
1;I stopped in here for lunch one day last week.  I had been wanting to check it out for a while since it is just down the street from my office.  The reviews saying it was expensive kept me away but now after seeing the menu I don't think it so bad compared to other places in the area.  You really can't get a lunch for less than $10 anywhere in Old Town Scottsdale unless you do fast food or the food court in the mall.  I thought the place was decorated super cute and with a nice relaxing atmosphere and the staff was very friendly.\n\nBut the food was just kind of average.  I had a 1/2 panini and soup and they both pretty much tasted like something I could make at home.  I also took home a couple of pastries (now those are way overpriced, I agree) that also were not too impressive.  I will definitely give them another try just since they are so close.  Hopefully some of their other menu items will be better.  They did have great smelling cappuccinos so I may try to sneak out some time for a mid-morning coffee and croissant.\n\nI think this is a cute little French cafe to stop by for a quick lunch if you are in the area but I would definitely agree with Suzanne S. that it is not a destination restaurant at all.  There are a lot better options nearby.
4;Loved this place!  The food was great, service was great, and the atmosphere was awesome!  Came here with a group of 8, at prime dinner time, and was quoted a half hour to 45 minute wait.  Not a big deal for us since we weren't in any hurry.  However, we were pleasantly surprised when seated only after 20 minutes.  Our server was attentive and very nice.  He even split up our checks and let all of us use our Localdines coupons we had!!  Thank you!!  I got the black bean burger and it was amazing!!  Tons of flavor and our server suggested I get the mixed fries of sweet potato and original and that was a great suggestion!!!  A little bit of everything!  We sat inside at a part that looked like a sun room.  It was extremely clean and classy and felt really comfortable with our big group.  The outside looked really nice too but we didn't have a chance to experience that.  Valet parking is complementary in the back between The Vig and CIBO.  Which is a total PLUS!  Parking is so hard to find downtown.  We will definitely come here again!!
4;Traditinoal
2;We held some events here at this venue. The facilities are very nice. Big beautiful ballrooms. The banquet staff was helpful and friendly. We had minimal wait times to have our requests met. The one complaint that I have is concerning signage and directions. It was very confusing and difficult to find an area to unload our gear. We finally ended up using valet to accommodate our parking and unloading needs. It was extremely frustrating.
4;I loved this place and would eat here almost once a week, but i went there Friday (5/27/11) and it said it was closed and relocating.
2;08/09/11: Another star lost from my review. We walked up to a promising sight, the line to be seated was 100% EMPTY. This is the first time I had ever seen it like that. Within moments, we were seated and our party of 4 began chatting and catching up.\n\nFIFTEEN MINUTES passed before our server, Rodrigo, decided to stop by our table. We had enough time to decide what we wanted in that time, so drink and food orders were given at the same time. Rodrigo read them back properly, it was promising that my order would not be messed up again (The last two times when I asked for EXTRA sauce on the side, my sandwich would have no sauce on it).\n\nWe were rather surprised when our food came out within a couple minutes. Well, most of it did. Somehow, between reading back our order correctly and inputting it into their order computer, our server managed to forget to put in some of my food. The foodrunner ran back and made sure the last bit was cooked and arrived very quickly too.\n\nAll of the special order requests and extra sides (with sauce on the sandwich) were correct. Almost. For some reason, they decided to put the wrong cheese on my sandwich, but the guests sitting across from me, who ordered the same sandwich, all had the proper cheese.  Little things add up when you are annoyed!\n\nEven better than the special orders being right, this visit, the cooks managed to actually grill the bread! \n\nI won't dock the restaurant for this next bit, but the older, grandmother looking lady (she had what looked to be 3 generations in her party) kept staring at our table (which was in the corner) with a scowl on her face. It was kind of creeping me out.\n\n07/07/11: The food is almost always perfect. The service is hit or miss. Although, the worse the service, the more true to form this location is to all of the other steak n shakes I have had the pleasure of eating at during many trips back east.
0;They did not mind that my ID was expired while I was losing...as soon as I win, they take the winning and say I can't play then kick me out the floor... Wtf.
2;It was just okay. We came here for happy hour and were surprised by the lack of people inside. The happy hour menu was very limited and we were underwhelmed with everything that we ordered. It wasn't terrible just wasn't great and we were expecting great food based on reviews and articles written about the restaurant.
3;I adore this club. That's all I have to say. Probably one of my favorites in Las Vegas, as far as a beach club goes. The venue is pretty big and the pool is sectioned off into two parts with a walkway between them. There are plenty of places to sit on the various plants that they have around the sides of the pool and there are multiple bars, which make alcohol access easy. The sound from the DJ playing carries pretty well across the venue so that's not a big problem. \n\nThe only beef with this place is once again the small dance floor. I guess I've been spoiled with other dance floors, because it just seems so tiny. I have also noticed that the people that come to this place are a fun bunch. I've had better experiences with people here then at almost any other nightclub in Vegas. It it definitely worth checking out if you are in the area. Especially if it's summer and a DJ you like is playing. Swimming AND listening to techno is probably the best thing ever. Get there a little early though, since it tends to get packed on the weekend, as do all nightclubs. Also, as per usual, girls are less expensive to get in then men. Yay for Vegas norms. \n\nThe club itself is beautiful. There are many things to gawk at while you are walking around drinking your drink and there is a hot tub in case you don't feel like dipping into the pool. Who cares if you have to share it, it's a hot tub! They also have seats that you can reserve in a shallow part of the water, in case you feel like boozing in the pool. One more fun thing that they do is have a variety of pool toys (ei, beach balls) floating around to play with. That made me happy. I didn't drink when I went there, because all clubs are horribly overpriced.
1;"My husband and I took a trip to Phoenix last weekend so I booked a room on priceline. Based on my PAST Priceline experiences, I was expecting something better. The hotel was recently upgraded and it's beautiful...our room was really nice...the decor was nice and exactly what I saw on their website...\n\nOk THE GOOD:\n\nIt's close to Walgreen's which was cool because I haven't a clue how I could forget simple things like LOTION! But it was nice to pick up beer, wine and munchies because the room had a fridge! \n\nTHE BAD:\n\nTHE PARKING? OMG...there's a lot in the front (but it's super small). The hotel parking is not just BEHIND the hotel, but behind ANOTHER hotel (the Radisson). That's about 1/2 block away (WHACKNESS).  \n\nTHE UGLY:\n\nThis hotel has HORRIBLE ventilation and plumbing. After we checked in, we decided to head out for an early dinner after the long drive. By the time we got back our whole room smelled like SHIT. Yes folks, I just dropped an \""S\"" bomb...it smelled as if someone had crept into our room while we were gone, took a dump and split. We discovered that it was coming from the AC vent...so we turned the fan off. Except then the room got stuffy and the freakin windows DON'T OPEN. O-EMMM-GEEEEE...\n\nThen about an hour later we heard what sounded like a jack hammer (which my husband explained was probably the snake cleaning out a toilet). A few minutes later...clean air! How bout this continued to happen for hours at a time each day we were here...NOT COOL.\n\nI couldn't WAIT to check out...I was up first thing in the morning packin it up so we could RUN (not walk) outta this place. Sorry Holiday Inn...get your SHIT together! LMAO...no seriously...lol"
0;"I am leaving this store angry and can't resist writing a review! \n\nThe staff is incredibly useless....if you can actually find someone to help you. The store is huge with very little signs to guide you. Therefore I always wander aimlessly looking for the one simple thing I stopped in for (even though I tell myself I will never go back) with no one to help me. \n\nToday they were out of an item I bought last week and need more of to finish my project. I asked the only 100 year old lady I could find to check the back and she told me they have nothing in back and to ask customer service. The lady at customer service was actually a reasonable age and when I asked her to call the Indian Bend store she handed me their number and said \""well you can call them\"". I stormed out soooo mad and this time I promise to never go back. Hobby Lobby or Michaels is worth the drive!!!"
4;I have been here in Vegas for 5 years. This is the first restaurant we found when I moved here. And haven't stopped going since. My husband and I had our wedding reception here. The food is absolutely delicious. I've tried almost everything on the menu and it's all so yummy. The most authentic Italian I've ever had. My husband and I recommend: shrimp on the stone and calamari for starters. I love the eggplant rollatini and my husband gets nothing but the lasagna. Mike is great!!! Enjoy! There is a lot of food so make sure not to eat a lot before. :)
1;This Taco Bell is located very close to Paradise Valley, which is evident because the Fry's supermarket that shares the same parking lot offers complimentary Valet Parking....LOL.\n\nWhen I walked up to the counter, there was no cashier present.  I stood and waited for a few minutes...and waited....and waited.  I finally snapped this photo because I was bored.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/taco-bell-phoenix-13?select=B_8TxcUXg61PmzTghnax5g#2hQRkmgKs5nxkjs9eXNnxg\n\nWhen he finally showed up, I ordered my regular 7 Layer Burrito and 2 Bean Burritos.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/taco-bell-phoenix-13?select=B_8TxcUXg61PmzTghnax5g#B_8TxcUXg61PmzTghnax5g\n\nThe food came out fast and accurate.  They were a little sloppy making the Bean Burritos as they had red sauce on the outside of the tortilla....which makes for a sloppy meal.  I would've expected better service from a restaurant so close to PV.\n\nOverall, it wasn't too bad, but it was inconsistent.\n\nReturn Factor - 20%
0;First off F*** sapphire. The most racist strip club on the planet. I already heard rumors about them shunning minorities but after a personal experience now I know it's true. I get the limo deal for the 2 drinks minimum cover for $30. Cool no problem. Limo picks me and my friend up by MGM no problem. We get there and the place looks nice from the outside but unfortunately I didn't get to see much more than that. We get to the front and get carded. I'm thinkin I'm about to have the best exprerience ever but WRONG!! One of the security guards say I'm  too intoxicated. What?!? Now I had a few drinks before got there but I was far from intoxicated. I would understand if I was stumbling and puking everywhere but I was very much coherent and far from too intoxicated. But don't take my word for it. Ask some of the locals and they will say the same thing. Sapphire is racist and minorities clearly aren't welcome there. Don't say I didn't warn u
3;The place is small but trendy.  It's always packed with good looking people and bartenders.  Good burgers and the fries are OUTSTANDING!
0;This place continues to send out damaged parts so disappointing! I warn you to not except anything that is shipped before you inspect it. The will stick you ! There packaging Sucks and they will try to blame the trucking company it will take 90 days of you fallowing up with them and at the end you get burned. Good prices sucky parts and service!
0;Given the loathsome politics of Sheldon Anderson, I refuse to stay or gamble at this casino...but, dear lord, I can't come to Vegas without eating breakfast at Bouchon or experiencing the majesty of a copy of Shakespeare's second folio at Bauman's Rare Books.\n\nPerhaps I'm a hypocrite.  \n\nPerhaps one negative review of this place doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things.\n\nRegardless.... if you care about such things, visitors really need to consider what will be done with the money you spend here.
2;The tacos were ok. Be sure that if you order take out for a large group, that you specifically ask for utensils, napkins, etc.
3;Now I've only gone to D.D for breakfast prior to this past Saturday.  I try to stay as far away from the area I work on the weekends.  LOL  With gelato calling my name, us still needing dinner, and wanting a burger than Thai food Saturday night...I suggested D.D.  \n\nWe arrive and its pretty empty inside with one party of 8 seated a few tables over.  We sit down and wait about 5+ minutes for someone to come take a drink order (though someone had been around with water a minute after we sat down). A few minutes longer and J said he would have wanted to leave.  \n\nThe water you get is cucumber water, with a slice of cucumber in it.  I didn't mind, but J thought it was terrible. \n\nThe gal comes by and we order our beverages and decide on an app because they were on happy hour special.  \n\nThe Chicken Pouches are very tasty!!! J especially liked the sesame orange and balsamic reduction sauce.  He's not a huge fan of wontons, but he liked these.  \n\nWe both ordered burgers with the combo fries (sweet potato and crispy) - \nMine - DD Burger w. bacon on the side  J - Gladiator.  \nThese burgers were huge!!!  The bacon was especially tasty and I ate it separate from my burger.  J ate about 3/4 of the burger and said he was stuffed.  But said that the burger was good.  Portion sizes were generous.  And he would suggest it to his coworkers for one of their Friday lunch outings.  \n\nWill I be back?  Silly question!   Breakfast or Lunch/Dinner..this place is a winner!
4;I took my fianc\u00e9 here after looking on Yelp and could not have been happier. The food was great, the service was phenomenal, and the venue is very intimate.  You won't be disappointed.
3;"Much has been said about the other Ranch Market location (http://www.yelp.com/biz/IiwgHkUbBt9Ha25H4dUtkw) but I have to give some major props to my neighborhood location.  It is as amazing as the other location, but more important for me, when I first moved into my house it was the closest grocery store.  I had no idea what to expect when I walked into the place.  WOW! It was like a happy assault on my senses.  You walk right into their bakery section and the view of the cakes and deserts combining with the smell of sweet breads and cinnamon was kinda like love at first sniff.  Their veggie section is second only to AJ's in my mind - but for less than 1/2 the price.  And while my girlfriend has always been picky about where she would buy fruit and meat - this is her favorite place to get meat and seafood in town.  \n\nMinus one star for the parking - which is never pleasant, the fact that I'm occasionally surprised by what they don't have, and since this location isn't quite as popular w/ the gringo's yet in some departments you can't find someone who can speak even limited English as my high school Spanish does NOT help me here.  The English part is slowly changing and now I can always be sure to at least check out with someone who is bi-lingual.  \n\nAs my neighbor said when I took them here \""Wow!  How can you ever be sad when you leave here? It's like a party!\"". Therapy by shopping?  Not a bad plan..."
0;So maybe 1 star is a little harsh, and only for the casino,  But I didn't see a single thing here that would make me want to come back,  much less even stay here.  The casino was fairly small, and the ventilation was pretty poor compared to the other casinos on the strip (which is also why I avoid Fremont st).\n\nThe dealers were in normal Hooters garb, nothing too exciting.  A couple friends took advantage of the single deck black jack table and were all in a pretty sour mood by the time they were done.  The dealer had these ridiculous specific rules to follow, from how to hit (can only do it with you cards) to how you're supposed to tap the table, to not allowing you to really talk with other people at the table.\n\nREALLY NOW?\n\nNot worth it.  The vibe was oppressing and the dealers were irritating.  Definitely won't waste my time coming back here my next time in Vegas.
2;"With all of the banh mi reviews recently on Yelp (Misti Y. seems to write one every other day) I was craving some sandwiches. Now, I don't know anything about banh mi  and my trip to Dakao was my first time trying one. As others have mentioned, Dakao is tiny. There's only one tiny, metal patio table that seats two in their shop. So plan on eating elsewhere. \n\nI decided to try the grilled chicken and BBQ pork. I didn't like the chicken. The quality of the meat wasn't the best and it lacked flavor. The BBQ pork, on the other hand, was a winner. The flavor was good and the amount of pork that filled the baguette made this $3 sandwich a bargain. With the carrots, daikon, cilantro and cucumbers it was a delicious sandwich with a little bit of a kick from the jalape\u00f1os. The outside of the bread was crispy, but the inside wasn't as soft and chewy as I had hoped (old bread perhaps?). Bread is the key to making any good sandwich great, so I can't give this experience any more than 3 stars.\n\nThere was a sign that said \""cash only\"" but when I asked the girl at the register she said they accept credit cards for purchases over $8."
3;"My boyfriend and I stayed here for my birthday. I'm absolutely in love with this place. Beautiful structured and designed.\nI took one star off only because we did have to move once, it had a half empty beer bottle and fuji water sitting on the counter, we didn't wanna take a chance in case they missed anything else!\n\nI just can't wait to go back. ;)"
0;I had Fukumimi Ramen to go for lunch.  Chashu was good but the soup broth was very so bad that I could not finish it. I was really hoping for a good ramen restaurant on the east side of town but that wasn't the case. Not even close to Monta or even Sora. Not recommended.
2;The food here was really great. I recommend the Nutella milkshake. My husband and I both love it. I had Le Paris burger and he had the Mediterranean. I enjoyed his more than mine. Just be aware fries do not come with the order, you pay for those separate. The waitress could have been more friendly. It took her ten minutes just to come over and tell us she be with us in a bit. Restaurant wasn't even full. The only time she came over was to take our order, bring our food and then bring out check. No drink refills, no asking if we needed anything else. When she brought back the check she said have a good day with her back turned towards us walking away.
3;Came here with the family and it wasn't a bad place for dimsum. Surprising for sure! I didn't think to expect much but the food and selection was pretty good!\n\nNothing really stood out but everything was really good. Wouldn't be surprised if I came back if I was craving some dim sum.
3;Great place!  Food was good, bit of a wait for a table but that just tells you how good it is!  Once my cholesterol goes back down, I'll be back for the big breakfast again!!!
3;When I think about the Light nightclub I think about CLARITY by Zedd. \n\nHad the most amazing time with my group of friends all THREE times I went here. It is SUPER packed all the time, but the venue is just how I like it. It's just a huge open space, unlike hakkasan. I hate clubs that are designed like dungeons with multiple hallways to get to different rooms. I like the one large room kind where you can see EVERYONE if you go to the top floor. The dance floor is relatively big and the strippers that dangle off the ceiling do cool shows as the night rolls through. It's super spacious in terms of how it's designed but in terms of capacity that may not be the case. \n\nWe got bottle service the first time around, it was about $3000 which is no surprise in Vegas, but honestly getting bottle service was SO worth it. The only thing that irritated me was all the chicks that came towards our table to talk to my guy friends so they could mooch off our drinks and sit with us. Freakin' ugly bitches too. I was so irritated, but other than that getting a table is SO worth it. The tables are right by the dance floor and there's so much energy!! Dance floor is always poppin, but once you leave your spot, your spots gone forevers.. \n\nThe lights at the club is super trippy and goes well with EDM music. From all the clubs I went to in Vegas, I like Light the most. Yeah, XS, marquee may be fancier in terms of the overall club, but i like the crowd at the light better. They're more young and less creepy.
3;Went with my wife, 2 daughters, my niece, and her girlfriend. We were seated quickly. We ordered snacks (fries, light sandwich) and then some desserts. The desserts were the real reason we went. The milkshakes were to die for. We have dairy and gluten issues in the group and they accommodated without an issue. They would have 5 stars if the service had been faster - the server quite literally walked past our table several times while we were calling out and did not come. Even when we did so in native french (as we had a couple of french as first language folks with us). But I'd be willing to bet it's an anomaly and I'll give them the next star if I go back and see different. The food and atmosphere were directly on target.
0;So after reading great reviews on yelp I decided to try this place out. I have tried many different nail salons in the valley but never been satisfied. Whenever I get a chance to go visit So Cal I get my nails done there. Otherwise, I just do my own nails at home. Nail tech that worked on me was a male and he manhandled my hands. He was so rough and over did it with his nail file drill even after I told him my nails are very thin so he needed to be extra careful. I even yelped out few times because he was putting too much pressure on my nails. After I got home my finger tips were throbbing so bad I couldn't even zip or button my pants or touch anything. Took ibuprofen for couple days till the pain subsided. Finished work looked sloppy and acrylic is already lifting off my nails. I will never go back to this place.
0;"I went the bagel cafe and had horrible service last week and just figured it was their \""ny deli\"" attitude. So today I called and placed a to go order for the Jewish holidays and according to them they don't take to go orders for \""small orders\"" anymore . I am not sure what constitutes a small order since I am ordering over 50.00 of food. This was directly from the manager that the owner has implemented a new policy this year. Totally disappointing I will have to take my business elsewhere."
0;"Never again will I be going to the MGM Grand. I had a terriable experiance here.  This review is more about the hotel rooms and teh staff than the hotel as a whole. I will say that i went to their pool and it was ok. Nothing special. They have a lazy river but it is always overly crowded and sort of a meat market. The staff at the pool was nice and when there was a lighting storm they immediatley had every guest get out of the pool\n\nI went to Las Vegas for my bachelorette party. We decided to stay at the MGM Grand because the cost for the hotel rooms were pretty decent.  We checked in on a Thursday. When we went to the front desk to check in, we immeditatley received horrbible customer service. The gentleman at the front desk was very unwelcoming. We asked if he would be able to upgrade us since it was my bachelorette party. He was able to do this for an extra fee. We decided to do this since it would end up being a larger room. He let us know that our card would not be charged until check out. (which he was incorrect about. I received a call from my fiancee why there was a charge for $800 about 5 minutes after we checked in. I had to straighten that out with teh front desk the next morning) He then asked us what our plans for this evening and we told him that we would be going to Tao for dinner. He gave us a disgusted look and told us that he had never been there but heard horrible things and that our dinner choice was a bad one. We then asked if he had any suggestions and he did not respond. He handed us our room keys and that was it.... nice was to start the weekend. \n\n\n\n\nWe went up to our room and we were blown away by how HOT our room was. I ran over to air condition and saw that it was on the coldest and highest setting. We thought since it was a larger room, maybe it needed more time to cool down. The lighting in teh hollywood suite was akso very, very dim. It was extremley hard to see much of anytihng in our room. We went out that night and when we came back, it was still so hot. it was compleltley miserable. On top of that, we could not locate the light switch to turn off the main light in the bedroom.It was about 4 am but we called the front desk in hopes that someone could help us. The woman on the other line was just as bad as the gentleman at the fron desk. She must have thought we were dumb, drunk people who were being stupid. I completley understand asking someone how to turn off the light might sound like a stupid question but we seriously could not find the light switch. We also asked her if she could send someone up to help us with our air condition as it was very hot in our room. She said someone would be up shortly...Well obviously shortly can mean very different times to different epople. A Half hour later we were still waiting for someone to come up to our room. We called about 5 more times and each time the lady would either tell us what we wanted to hear, hang up the phone or just transfer us to another department(i.e. house keeping, maintence or the food service...) very odd behavior for someone working in customer service. I get that they probably get alot of drunk phone calls in the middle of the night/early morning but  if you have someone working at that time, then i would suggest they be helpful to the people paying to stay at your hotel. FINALLY someone came to our room by 5am. He searched and searched but he too was not able to turn off the light in the main room. He asked us if he could just break the light. He almost did until he called someone else and was able to find teh light swtich; which was behind the armour. He said he had never seen something like that. He also had no idea how to fix the air condition. Great...\n\nAfter sweating through the night from the intense heat, we left  to talk to someone in person at teh front desk. A different gentleman  tried to help us with our air condition problem. He said someone would go up shortly and that we did not need to be in the room while he was fixing it...We decided to leave for an afternoon of shopping. When we came back the room was completley miserable! It was just so hot. We called teh front desk again and the woman suggest we move to anotehr room. Fantastic. So they moved us....right next door. The room was just as hot and miserable and the room was in worse condition: Lamps did not work, plugs were burnt out, furniture was broken and the air condition did not work. We then called the front desk to explain o ur dilemma and about 45 minutes later, anoterh maintence guy came up. He was in our room for about an hour and finally fixed the air condition. \n\n\nI have never had such a bad experiance at a hotel. I have never felt so un-welcome. I will NEVER go back to the MGM Grand."
3;If you want to see the slowest drive-thru line at a Starbucks in Las Vegas this location will put on a show for you. Once you get through the long drive thru line though the drinks are always made right and you still get service with a smile even though the staff is clearly frazzled. And for that reason alone...they get 4 Stars from me.
0;"I had been meaning to check out the burger at Postrio, and I was already at The Venetian checking out the eternal twilight of Saint Mark's Square. This Wolfgang Puck establishment delivered the culinary equivalent of \""bad touch\"" from mom's new boyfriend. I should have known that everything was going to go terribly wrong from the painful interaction with the server..\n\nMe: What are the cuts of beef in the burger?\nShe: Angus.\nMe: That is a type of cow. I am more interested in the parts of the cow that the meat comes from so that I can order my burger cooked to a temperature that is most appropriate. Can you please go check?\nShe: *huff*\nMe: Am not trying to be a pain; I am trying to order the burger correctly so that I can properly review it.\n\nI assumed that she was new or fussy or just plain bad at her job. I failed to take this as an omen. The other clue was that the restaurant was all but empty in the middle of the bustling St. Mark's Square. Postrio was Italian slang for \""crappy food and service.\""   \n\nThe beef was flavorful and beefy. Sadly, it was over-cooked and rubbery. The burger patty had the shape and texture of a fist. Beyond that, the burger was peppered with connective tissue. \n\nThe burger's exterior tasted like an oniony salt. It was as if it had been dusted with cheap onion soup mix.\n\nThe bun was stale and dry...really dry and stale. The bun was burned to the point of tasting like carbon. The bottom of the bun had black grill marks, which imparted a nasty bitterness directly to the tongue.\n\nThe kitchen at Postrio phoned it in and subsequently dropped the ball. After I sent my meal back, there was no offer for a refire or a make-good of any sort. Apparently, that was their best effort.\n\nThe manager, Luckas, agreed that the bun was burned and stale and that the burger was rubbery. I sent my plate back after a scant 3 bites.My son got through a third of his before he gave up due to the strong flavor of char. I was granted the \""friends and family discount.\"" Postrio only charged me $37 for that shameful mess. Jerks!\n\nFront and back of house were a well-oiled machine designed to lighten wallets and deliver awful food. Postrio earned the title of worst burger in Las Vegas. On the day that I visited, the quality of the burger and service was excremental, and that was being generous.\n\nAfter a bit of back and forth over email, Postrio did refund the cost of the meal."
0;Won't go back EVER. After two year of going to this place I have had enough.\nHorrible customer service. Rude Rude Rude.....
4;Delicious burgers!\n\nGlad I finally got to try this place. The burger didn't disappoint. The only con may have been the waitress...she wasn't as fast in taking our orders and our checks, but it was also a busy day. \n\nGot the spicoli. Bacon, mushrooms, onions and cheese. Need I say more? It was so flavorful! The burger was perfectly cooked too (generous amount...). I was so full. Got the fries (you pay extra for these). Oh and a little suggestion--it was a bit misleading but we were told that you can order a half salad instead of the chips (so bizarre to me that they offer chips with burgers). However, note that you pay for the half salad so it's not a true substitution. This was not very clearly stated by waitress and a few people were disappointed to have to pay $4 or so extra for the side salad. \n\nThe fries were good too. Aside from those issues, the burgers are tasty and I'd come back again!
1;Ok, my rating for this restaurant is:\nDecor - 5 stars\nFood - 3 stars\nService - 2 stars\n\nI read the other reviews of this restaurant and they are pretty bad. I don't think that the management really care about it because when we got there we had to wait to be seating and the restaurant was packed.\nI presume that it is why the service was so slow. I don't blame our waitress for the time it took her to attend us, their understaffed!\nSo is the kitchen!\n\nThis too bad, because it has a lot of potential to be a place where ppl can enjoy and have fun.\n\nAs long as this is their rating, I don't think I'll eat there again
4;"I love, love, love how the California casino/hotel caters to the Hawaiian community.  And Local and transplant Hawaiians reciprocate by visiting this hotel almost exclusively it seems!  Therefore, we always make it a point to visit this place when we are downtown. We stumbled upon this place at the mezzanine level of the casino and saw a long line forming out the door that just kept growing.  Of course  we had to try out the food here even though we ate not 2 hours  ago.\n\nI had the special: Ochoa zuke#1:  tea , rice, Teri chicken, spam, fishcake, Saba (mackerel) and assorted pickles... $9.99\n-nicely done and presented in bento box.  EVERYTHING was YUMMMMMMM...\n\n-ahi poke: fresh ahi tuna marinated in soy sauce, sugar, limu, green onions etc.. Generous portions and very fresh.\n\n-coffee was 50 cents and my hubby was shocked.\n\nThere really isn't an 'ambiance' here, it's basically a \""mom and pop\"" Hawaiian style cafe in a casino which for the California hotel, is quite suitable! \n\nCash only."
3;Bustling but pleasant atmosphere that has a neighborhood feel, but delicately spiced fare.  Would say it's the best curry of several thai places in Shadyside/Sq Hill.  Moo yang pork is also recommended as excellent appetizer.  If you decide to get take out, walk around and enjoy Highland park's excellent and eclectic architectural styles.
1;Actually it would be more like a 2 1/2.\n\nThe rolls are really good and fresh tasting, but really overpriced.  And although the decor is cool and the employees are friendly,  the place is loud.  I mean LOUD.  So loud you can't hear the person you're eating dinner with.  What's the point of eating out if you can't even converse?
3;I came here with my friend and her boyfriend when I visited Pittsburgh on her recommendation and thought it was a solid fun dinner. The highlight of the meal was definitely getting a free peach sangria for checking-in on Yelp because the sangria was delicious! I really liked that they used sparkling wine and put a lot of fruit in it. \n\nBetween the three of us, we ordered a pair of ceviches (scallops with black bean and corn ceviche and ahi tuna with their ceviche of the day, pineapple jerk), the Mojo Nigiri, the Jimmy Roll, BBQ Duck Mac n Cheese, and a trio of tacos (the baja fish, BLT and cheesesteak tacos). Overall, I thought the food was alright aside from some stand outs. My favorite dish was the Jimmy Roll because of the tempura and sriracha aioli. I really liked the scallop ceviche when paired with the plantain chips because I'm a sucker for anything plantain. The BBQ Duck Mac and Cheese was also unique and very tasty. Aside from those, I thought the dishes could be improved on. The Mojo Nigiri was good, but I would have preferred a little soy sauce to add some saltiness to the acidity. The ceviche of the day was a little too sweet from the pineapple. The tacos were nothing special and a little dry in my opinion. \n\nOverall, I think Seviche is a good place to have drinks and some small bites. I feel like my experience was a 3.5, but will round up to 4 since we got a free glass of yummy sangria. If you are planning on ordering a lot like we did, I would suggest requesting a table bigger than the small hightop we were given since our food could not all fit on the table.
0;Thought I'd save money by staying at motel6.  I got there early and mgr said I'll have to wait since 2nd floor rooms have not been cleaned.  I come back in couple hours and get key, go to room.  Room smelled bad, strong chemical smell.  I unpack some stuff and pulled back covers to lay down, sitting on edge of bed.  I put my hand on edge and bed is wet, surprised I get up and smell my hand, URINE! SOB!  I grab the phone to call desk and see blood on speaker end and in cradle, EFFING BLOOD!  I will never ever stay at a motel6 even if it's the last one left.  Stay away from this hell hole!
1;Going into this review, you should know I'm basing this review on what I expect a really locals-only gaming place should be. \n\nI found myself at the Wildfire because there were some dudes working on my car down the street from there. Seeing as it was going to take them an hour to get me going again, I decided to walk out to the Wildfire. \n\nI don't know what I was expecting, but this place is really small. It's just a casino, so there's no hotel portion like Texas Station or Arizona Charlie's or anything like that. As such, the place is really small and there aren't (currently) any restaurants like the aforementioned properties. And I say (currently) because there's a burger place there about to open up, it seems. \n\nSince the place is gaming-only and has a bar, I should write more about that... except there really isn't much to write about. The bar is small, and the gaming area is small, too. I spent about 20 mins and $10 there, and I don't really have a lot to say about it. \n\nWould I return? I guess, but the Texas across the way would be a much better bet.
0;Chef Keller,\nI'm deeply sadden that I have lost respect to any restaurants that your not presently managing/cooking.  The lack of details and attention astounds me.\n\nI was thinking about Bouchon all day for dinner and come to a nightmare.  \n\nService:\n1. Waiter - There was not 1 but 3 parties that left because of there aweful service.  The party of 2 next to us was pressured for about 2-3mins to order appetizers while entr\u00e9es are being cooked.  After trying the appetizers (olives) and viewing our entr\u00e9es, they simply got up and left.  The other party of 2 simply did not like the waiter and got up and left.  Not sure what happened to the other party of 2 but my friend said they walked up and left.  \n2. Bus boys - Why are tables being cleared when food is still being eaten.  We had muscles and fries on our table still being eaten and a bus boy comes over to clear our table while were still eating.  I'm not sure if he understands English but come on!\n\nFood:\n1. Mussels- we specifically asked for appetizer mussels not entr\u00e9e muscles.  We see the bill of entree muscles.  I give props on fries.  Although it was a little salty but very well done.  Mussels were fresh but the sauce was lacking depth and substance.  \n2. Black Label Ribeye (special) - Roasted black label (better than prime) cooked raw!  The sauce was running all over the plate and the vegetables tasted dirty, probably not cleaned properly. \n3. Roasted Chicken - Best dish of the night.  Crispy surface, moist inside, with a wine reduction sauce.  \n4. Lamb - Cook medium rare but nothing special about it.\n\nWine:\nYour wine sommelier working the night of  9/11/2011 should be fired.  Why is wine not opened and poured at the table?  Heavy, dirty, grimy, unpleasant sediments can be found in the wine, which is why I prefer wine to be opened/poured at the table. A begging sommelier should not be pouring wine at the end of the bottle and finishing it from a new bottle, no excuses!  If this sommelier is only bringing wine to the table, why even have one?  Why not have the waiter bring it to the table?\n\nI would like to continue giving more details of my experience at Bouchon but I hate hate hate writing bad reviews.  Please Please Please avoid Bouchon at the Venetian.  I said please! =)
4;"Here's one word that describes our experience at Morels:  decadent.  We were in town to watch GNR at The Joint, and I wanted to find a nice restaurant to celebrate my husband's birthday.  I read some of the reviews and was slightly apprehensive, but I took the plunge and made the reservations.  \n\nAlthough we were 30 minutes late, the hostess quickly sat us.  As other people have mentioned, the dining room at Morels is quite beautiful and elegant.  There's no smoking allowed which makes the dining experience that much more pleasant.  The clientele is a diverse mix.  To our right was a couple that was dressed in smart casual clothes (think dinner attire on a cruise).  To our left diagonal was a guy in a t-shirt and jeans with a mullet.  To our right diagonal was a party of 6 dressed in cocktail attire.  So in case you were wondering what the dress code was, it was fairly lenient.\n\nWe had three people helping with our table.  I, unfortunately, can only remember Mike who was the \""captain.\""  He was sensational as was his team.  Service was exemplary.  We never wanted for anything.  \n\nOur evening started out with two piping hot dinner rolls served with olive paste and creamy butter.  Then we were served the soup du jour which was a seafood bisque.  It was described to be similar to a lobster bisque.  The bisque was creamy and just hot enough to sip.  Along with the soup came the bibb lettuce and crab salad as well as the tuna tartare.  It was a very fresh and citrusy salad topped with a subtle and light tarragon dressing.  The combination of the peppers and the sesame oil in the tuna was a perfect ratio, not too overpowering on one side of the flavor palate over the other.  For dinner, my husband ordered a petite filet mignon with a side of country mac & cheese.  Though I didn't taste the pasta, I assume he enjoyed it since there was nothing left in the bowl.  I did, however, taste the filet which was cooked to a perfect medium, slightly pink in the middle with a nice velvety brown coating on the exterior.  It came with a side of bordelaise sauce which was a nice complement to the steak.  I ordered the 18 hour braised short rib.  Just when I thought that The Farm's short rib couldn't be topped, I was proven wrong by the dish that the chef at Morels prepared.  It was tender, had a unique flavor, probably brought on by the lardons of bacon which were part of the dish, and the quality of the beef was superb. We topped off our meal with what can only be described as a mind-blowing dessert:  the hazelnut & gianduja chocolate dome.  Try it and you'll see.\n\nTwo more items on their menu which we found impressive:  they offered Duvel and Chopin.  We dined a several places in town while we were there and nobody had either of those two items on their menu.\n\nLucky for us, there's a Morels closer to home at The Grove so we won't be missing it for very long."
0;Renters beware! Noise level is off the charts!
4;Actually had our Thanksgiving dinner here and it was amazing! The food is seasoned just right- not too powerful and the service was IMPECCABLE!! After our meal, the owner came and introduced himself and made sure that we were happy with our experience there. Will definitely be stopping by again!
0;"The Gate Attendant was incredibly rude and disrespectful to us if front of other customers (and, this was after we volunteered to give up our window seat because she needed someone to sit in the exit isle.)  No perks, no thank you, simply a shrew of an employee having a bad day and then taking it out on a customer. \n\nLet's put it this way, she was so rude that all three (3) flight attendants who overheard her, apologized to me later during the flight.  One even offered to buy me a drink.  While I appreciate their efforts, I'm horrified that a US Airways Gate Attendant has no customer service training and is allowed to strut around like the monarch shouting \""Off with their heads.\""  The incident gave us a very poor image of US Airways.\n\nNext time we'll book with another airline."
0;"Worst Hotel ever to exist.  I know that the hotel around are a little more expensive.  But I would pay more not to have to deal with the front desk.  Most rude. Employees ever. \nAlso the rooms are worth about 20$ a night and my reasons would be the fact that my car got broke into 2 nights in a row.  I left the doors unlocked and they still broke the windows.\nWhen I informed the front desk the red head manager who refused to give me her name.\nSaid exact words \"" you park a brand new truck here what did you expect to happed\""\nI said what.  Next response was classic.\nHer words . \"" Well why did u stay here again if it happened last night.ans the camera are jut for us to watch most don't work . And told lvpd..they would have to get a Written order from the court before the would release the tapes."
0;The worst run airport parking service I have ever used.  I arrived at the pick up spot and waited almost 20 minutes for a shuttle to pick me up.  When it arrived it was completely full and the driver said another will be along soon. So about another 15 minutes later two more full shuttles arrive and tell me they are full as well. The driver actually told me I should get a cab. Being a part of Uber I just called a car to take me to the lot. Here is the best part. They claim their lot is secure. When I was dropped off in front I just walked by the the attendant while he was on his phone.  So naturally I was late because of this organization and they had nerve to try to charge me a late fee since I arrived an hour after my check out time. Never again will use this lot or recommend it to anyone. Pay the little extra and get better service.
1;"When I told people I was taking a trip to Las Vegas a few people told me to try the \""$20 Trick\"" - i.e. slip a $20 to try to upgrade to a better room. Now, for anyone who actually knows me that is the exact opposite of the way I like to operate, but I do like to get wait I paid for.\n\nI booked this hotel through expedia and upon checkin was told that my reservation for two queen beds was actually only a request and that my only option was to go for a room with one king. Now, unfortunately, I was not staying with an attractive brunette, but two friends and one bed between three people doesn't go very far. However, the front desk told me they could send up a cot and the next night they would switch us over to a two queen room. Awesome, right? Except there was no cot when we returned to the room and when we call the front desk they were out, and the next night there were still no double queen bed rooms available. I was very polite about the whole thing (getting mocked by friends for doing so) and felt that the hotel was pretty unapologetic about the entire thing.\n\nNow, the room was pretty nice - brand new, modern and super clean. However, the main drawback of this hotel is that it's off from the strip so it adds another 5-10 minutes walking back to the hotel (which in 40+ degree weather when you are hungover feels like eternity.) That and the pool here is actually split into three pools (so there's no central area to hang out at) and opens late and closes fairly early.\n\nThis hotel might appeal to an older crowd, but if you are younger and going with friends there are probably more convenient and better deals to be had. On previous trips I stayed at the paris and the venetian and both were much better in terms of value/customer service in my opinion."
3;I used to live in the area and was so excited when I came across this one.  One night after a concert my friends and I went their and ordered just about everything on the menu.  All was tasty.  My fav is the Southwestern Pork Quesadilla!!  Nice bar area...too...always important :-)
1;Mixed experience at this venue! \n\nFirst of all they bring in a great arsenal of comics which draws a definite crowd. My fiance, friend, and I went to go see Adam Devine on a sold out Friday night. The show in itself was great, all of the comedians had me on the floor ready to pee my pants. \n\nI was warned by various people to arrive early to get the seating your preferred and to avoid a line. We got there right when the doors opened tickets already in hand, we flew through the line with no issues. I was told by both staff and friends it's first come first serve seating.  Our hostess sat us in a terrible spot in the middle of a crowded table with a group of extremely tall guys in front of us. My friend and fiance aren't the tallest people, nor am I standing 5'9.  A server came around and we politely asked to be moved to an actual table or the bar which wrapped the higher portion of the venue in the back which would have been perfect for us. Instead we were forced into a small 5 top table with only enough space for 4. So we were crammed into a booth anticipating two more people to come sit in front of us having to share a tiny table for our drinks.  Thankfully we ran into two friends and snagged them at our table. Basically, don't offer first come first serve seating if we can't sit in our preferred location when we got here two hours early for that reason specifically.\n\nThe drinks weren't very strong and were extremely overpriced. Limited selection of alcohols.  My Bacardi & Coke's were in a 7-10oz glass and there was no hint of alcohol taste. I ordered 5 to catch a buzz.   Between one refillable soda, and 10 drinks our bill was roughly $140 with a forced 15% gratuity. Our serve was awful so  factoring a tip into the bill is a little absurd.     \n\n\nI will try this place again because they have great comedians come through. I'm not a complainer, but next time if we don't get our preferred seats I will ask for a manager.   Maybe we'll bring a flask in the boot as well, haha.
1;Not bad for airport fare, but the best thing about it was the packets of Grey Poupon. Had the French dip and basil pesto pasta salad side. Better choice than the adjacent McDonald's.
1;This place is really showing it's age.  The carpet has stains in it, the AC works 24/7 to keep the living room area at 72, the bedroom never cooled below 82.  Breakfast is good, and who could complain about free booze.  \nTwo times I had to wait over 30 mins for the van to pick me up at the metro.  One of the times, they went right past me at the meeting point.  After speaking with the manager, he refuned me 1 night out of 5 for my troubles of having to sleep on the couch 2 nights.\nBut I wish I stayed at the Double Tree.
0;My review is about the owner only! I've come here multiple times with my kids. They loved it. The younger lady that works there is great with kids, plays with them and is very friendly. I come back in the afternoon to were the owner is working, with in two seconds is already criticizing my children for taking stuff animals (which they hold the entire time they are here) up in the two store play structure. With out even giving me another sec to get situated, I am 6 month pregnant and sat on the couch to put my socks on, and she's yelling at me for not doing it u the door...  Saying we have to keep the carpets clean, which I get but all I did was set my sandals down while I put my socks on. I would of just left right then for her rudeness.. She could of been nicer or polite but she wasn't. I asked for a refund, but she would only refund 10$ of the 32$ I paid! If your going to run a children's place you might want to learn how to act around hormonal mothers and very small children who make messes!
2;I was not all that much of a fan of this place. For a bar in Charlotte/Pineville I figured it would be a bit nicer. They have a big patio and plenty of pool tables to mess around with. There is a level of things they need to upgrade, the POS (Point of Sales) computer they have at the bar. It looks like an old tower that is running Win 98 or something. The bar stools feel like they are going to break when you sit on them, and the plastic patio chairs too.
2;I thought I had reviewed Cibo before, but today I went to check back on what I wrote and apparently I never did. So here goes!\n\nIt's always been one of my favorite spots. The patio is incredibly cool, and a great place for a date, inside is no less cool and is awesome in decor. All the old bedrooms making the dining rooms is awesome. Antipasta is great, and pizza has always been great. I do take out here a lot and never mind eating inside either. \n\nLast night though, was my first visit in months, and it is just not the same. The pizza was overly doughy, and lacked that crisp wood fired taste and texture. The sauce wasn't the same, as it tasted very bitter in comparison to prior visits. I ordered the Salsicca and what used to seem like a high quality pizza, no longer did. The sausage was some sort of ground meat like substance, compared to what I remember being a high quality sliced sausage. Their wine list has changed since my last visit, and now only has one Cabernet... a rather shitty one at that. My friend had a white pizza that she enjoyed, though my observations about it were mostly the same as though it had gone downhill. \n\nI can't tear into the place though, as the atmosphere is too perfect. Service is spectacular as well, and though I'm bitching about the pizza, it's still great pizza. It's just not what I remember... maybe I've been eating Metro and Bianco too much lately.
3;the grinders are delicious-baked till crispy. the pot pie pizza is unlike anything anywhere and good. \nthe mediterranean bread is different and the hazelnut ice cream is a nice finish. place is too small-expect a wait. place has a piece of famous AZ  history-read about on the menu.
1;"Don't really know why the line was out the door.\n\nThe food was really heavy and I felt like rolling outside  the door afterwards because I was so bloated. Figures, I mean I DID go to a buffet ;)\n\nBut in all seriousness it is simply a Hometown Buffet... with a chocolate fountain. Nothing spectacular."
3;Whenever I need an outfit to go out or anywhere really, I look here first! Why? Because it's just a few minutes away from where I live and it's cheap! Plus, going all the way out to a mall can seem like a hassle. This store is usually a hit or miss for me but they do seem to add new items on the sales floor on most days, if not every day. So you will find a lot of new items a few days later. I'll admit i've shopped here a couple times a week when I was bored. \n\nThe floor set is always color coded. Definitely makes it easier when you're looking for a specific look! Shoes are placed throughout the store but mostly in the back left corner. You usually have to flag an employee down if you want to try on shoes in your size. Jewelry is in front of the cash registers in the back. The fitting rooms are in the back right. They're clean and big with a huge mirror. They do have a limit of just 6 items in the fitting room but I noticed if you come during non-peak hours, there isn't someone working in the fitting room so you can bring in as many as you want. The clothes here are very cheap. Don't expect much, you get what you paid for. I still have some of the things i've bought there but I've also had some become unwearable. Don't expect great customer service either! The employees are either handling the fitting room, cashiering, or doing go backs. That is it. However, one day I noticed there was one employee making an effort to talk to customers. At least someone is trying to do their job.\n\nEven with the fact the clothes are made with cheap material and they have bad customer service, this store still gets a good amount of foot traffic! There are always a lot of customers here so they must be doing something right.
3;I'm so glad Pittsburgh finally has ride share. I've been using Lyft since day 1. They are reliable and affordable. The same can't be said for Yellow Cab. Love that every time I request a ride there are plenty of Lyft drivers available.
4;This is by far the best Thai food around! Just had it for my first time yesterday. I'm so hooked. I ordered spicey beef noodle and had them add mint. Yummm
4;This was the second time I visited this buffet in Vegas. I had such s great experience the first time around, I had to bring my dad. \n\nFirst time wait: 2+hours then you get texted to go pay. Then I wanted an additional 30-40mins to be seated. Famished!\n\nSecond time wait: none. 30mins to get seated. \n\nFood: great variety of seafood (oysters, stone crabs, snow crabs legs, other hot seafood creations), meats (prime rib, trip tip and or sirloin, turkey, duck, lamb chops) and other ethnic foods (street tacos, sushi, Chinese, dim som, pho/udon noodle station) plus your regular salads, cheese, fruits, desserts and bread stations. \n\nService: mediocre. It takes the servers a while to get your drink and refill. The dirty plates were left on our table until my leg crabs carcasses practically crawled on the table. Slower than my past experiences. \n\nPrice first time: I came at dinner time so it was $50.99 a person. Dinner price. \n\nPrice second time: I paid right before 3pm on a Friday. $34.99 (one dollar off with players card) lunch price. \n\nQuality of seafood: oysters were more fresh the first time around. The second time around, they looked a bit dry and dehydrated. Crab legs were smaller second time around in comparison to the first. Stone crabs were okay. Not much flavor to them but meaty. \n\nEven though they have a great variety of food. I feel the lunch price is more reasonable. I did not notice any difference with food selection from lunch to dinner. By then again, by the time I went in, it was already dinner time.
3;My boyfriend and I just moved to Phoenix, and we were looking for a nice place for pizza. Luckily, Spinato's was just around the corner. The service was fantastic, with a wait time around seven minutes. Curious about their tea, our server allowed us to have a sample (in a rather large cup) of their green tea. Ultimately, we didn't order any tea, but our server provided consistent, positive service. My boyfriend and I ordered a large Da' Greek pizza for our meal. While the pizza combination was delicious, I did find a slight flaw. The only thing I didn't like was the amount of moisture soaked into the crust. I'm not sure if that's how the pizza is supposed to be, but it was almost impossible to eat without a fork. There was enough pizza to take home though, and the leftovers lasted us for a couple of days. Also, be sure to try the Cider. SO GOOD!
0;Customer service was mediocre.  Our guest suite had a nice set up, however, our room was hot as hell!  AC in hotel is turned off in all rooms so it took a few hours just to get it cool.  There is no elevator so we had to lug all of our stuff up and down the stairs.  We had coffee but no coffee maker?!  Ugh OK.  We asked for three extra towels but only got two... you get the picture.\n\nLots of things turned out to be a nuisance.  Would never stay here again.
0;With two baristas, both waiting around for an other to be paid for (instead of making orders ahead of time) and cashiers scattering between fetching drinks and taking payments, no wonder there's a line!\n\nI've been to enough Starbucks to know that this is not how most are run. Mix that with the most processed looking baked goods I have ever seen at a Starbucks -- are these knockoff Costco pastries -- and you have yourself a pretty sad sight. \n\nWhen you expect something standard from a well-known brand, it feels like an even greater fall from grace when it all goes wrong.
1;From the walk over to a casual look at the crowd I was expecting a horrible time, but I found everyone here to be friendly and pleasant. I didn't care for the cocktails here, but I had a far more pleasant time then expected. The manger Jerry is a really sweet fellow.
3;I'm a big fan of Asian foot reflexology spas! My friend raved about this place so much that I finally had to check them out. We went on a Saturday late afternoon with no appointment and was immediately taken in with no problem. For 60 minutes, they charge $20. That included hot stone. They soak your feet first in warm water as they massage your head, face, and arms. Then they dry your feet off and start working on the feet, legs, back, and butt. Yes, the butt too. It's great, so don't let this hold u back. The hot stone was my favorite! It made me just want to go to sleep. The hot stone fell for a quick second on my back but no big deal. Overall, a great experience. Just wasn't a fan of my masseuse's heavy breathing while he was massaging me. Lol! My only critique is that they should use more lotion/essential oils. It would just heighten the experience even more. Other than that, I left a very happy girl
4;This is a really nice place.  The decor is great and the service is super friendly.  I had the poblano burger and it was cooked perfectly.  They have mostly local beers on tap and I enjoyed the two different IPAs that I tried last night.
0;WORST dental experience EVER, tried to charge me for unnecessary things not covered by my insurance, what a scam, go someplace else!!!!
2;So confusing. It's layout is different from the rest of the Targets I go too. They don't have much Green Works products there. The sale items wasn't stocked. The place is clean, not much workers around to help.
3;We visited the Mirazozo exhibit here, which was excellent. It was very colorful and great for photos, although you will need to be patient with all of the crowding. There were also many other activities around the center, such as LEGO building stations for kids and human statues that were interacting with visitors.
0;"We too were driving by and stopped in.  It's pretty dirty.  Just look at the fish.  The eyes are all sunken in.  That's old fish.  Covering it up with ice just masks the smell (you can't smell dog poop when it's really cold either...).  We were impressed with the sauce isle.  You can get even kind of jarred or canned sauce for any Asian dish.  That's about all we would buy here.  We were still perplexed with some items in the meat department, including diced pig ears and a vat of pig's blood.  Not quite sure what one would do with that, but at the risk of sounding racist - Asians eat some \""dfferent\"" food items andfully utilize every portion of an animal."
1;"I've stayed at better mid-range hotel/motels before. If you're wanting to stay in the area and don't mind a little extra drive, stay at the La Quinta in Scottsdale, it's MUCH nicer - and a little more expensive. I stayed there on my last trip. I did great a really low price for this location. Now I see why. I was actually tempted to move to the Scottsdale location after the first night.\n\nWhen I arrivied after 10:00 PM the front desk clerk acted like I must have come to sell her insurance instead of to check in. \""What do you want? She asked with her font lip curled up and throat extended toward me. Not a friendly greeting. Later I called down to the front desk because I could not connect to the free wireless network. I had to let it ring over 5 minutes before anyone answered. I was able to connect but the connection was terribly weak and slow - adding a few more minutes to my day before I could get to bed.\n\nI am here the last of my five nights - I have only been able to connect to the network three of the days I was here. The desk was surly when I asked what I should do to find network service and they weren't very helpful.\n\nThe breakfast is standard La Quinta stuff. It's OK but don't expect any protein. It's all sugary cereal, breads and some fruit. OK if your want to sucker-punch your pancreas. The coffee is actually pretty good. Not too overly roasted but strong enough to call it coffee.\n\nThe temp has been over 110 here everyday and I'm surprised that the air conditioning at this motel/hotel isn't better. I was pretty miserable every night trying to find a balance between running the blasting, noisy AC unit under the window and keeping the temp tolerable. The bed is comfy, as advertised, though the sheets don't fit the mattress. I didn't sleep well because it's been so HOT in the room. Ugh!\n\nThere was no exhaust fan in the bathroom. So, after doing in the bathroom what bathrooms in hotel rooms are for, while traveling and eating travel food, I was dissapointed that I had to open the window and let 112 degree air IN to the bathroom in order to exhaust OUT to the otherwise prinstine Arizona environs what I had left behind in my tiny trailer-park type camode's delightfully drab air.\n\nThe little kitchen is very nice to have. I saved a few leftovers from dinner in the little fridge a couple times for a snack. That was nice - and the coffee maker in the room was easy to operate.\n\nI agree with the first reviewer in wondering why people live here. It's so #&@* HOT. There's no escape. Unless you stay somewhere nice."
4;Federal Pizza is truly awesome.  I am a fan of the marguerita pizza, I like to keep it simple when it comes to pizza.  The tomatoes are so fresh, it really blew me away.  Everyone at the table loved their food.  I've been in three times and each time Federal Pizza blows me away.  The staff is supper friendly.  One more recommendation, the doughnuts are fresh, soft and fluffy.  Not to be missed.
4;"Went again for our weekly NaRai 'fix'....Tried 'FANTASTIC ROLLS\"" which were clearly named by the first person to try 'em. Outstanding. LOVE this place."
3;"A fan's letter to Krispy Kreme: \n\n\nTo The GENIUS Who Decided To Put Krispy Kreme Donut Holes In A To-Go Cup:\n\nTHANK YOU!!!  \n\nOne for making me feel like I'm eating less calories since \""bite sized\"" donuts can't be nearly as bad as a whole one (ha) and Two for allowing me to drop these bad boys in my cup holder and not make a big mess while driving. \n\n- Candyce B\n\nPS- The staff says our beloved \""Hot Sign\"" is on 6am and 6pm....YUM!"
1;"Sadly, I didn't read the reviews before finally going here. It seems the only thing Mucho Gusto is good for is happy hour & I didn't really think those prices were all that amazing. I've never felt so ripped off by a Mexican food place before. I got the Machaco Tacos. Two tacos for $10, I figured it'd come with lettuce, sour cream, & definately some beans &/or rice on the side. What I got were tiny soft shells(I thought corn might be crispy, my bad) with a ton of VERY bland & somewhat dry meat & a slice(yeah, I said SLICE) of cheese. The only other taco I've ever seen in my life with a slice of cheese is at Jack in the Box. The side was a small cup of tortilla soup that came out with the meal. The soup & atmoshere were the only redeeming qualities. Even the picante sauce they called salsa for the chips was thin & lacking. My friend ordered the shrimp tacos(2 for $14) & the \""large shrimp\"" were small to medium sized frozen shrimp(about 4 on each taco) & dry. Even the service fell flat. Our waiter was brief with us, no smile, no chit-chat or other suggestions & after the food came, he didn't come back until we were completely done choking it all down. The busboy(or whatever he was), although not dressed at all professionally, was prompt & seemed friendly. Had I known what it'd be like, I would've much rather gone to Chipotle where it would be half the price, delicious/flavorful & much more friendly(not to mention they have the same beer). I work at a local hotel & recommended this place to several guests in the past(mainly because of the location & atmoshere) but now I'm embarrassed & I won't send anyone else. Sorry, but this one's a stinker. Try Macayos for margaritas or Rositas for a full menu that's always good."
2;We waited quite a while to be seated, although it was a busier night. The service was great, our waitress was very friendly. Food was just alright, and the beer was decent and cold, but overpriced. \nOverall, I'm glad I went once to try it, but I doubt I'd go back.
4;I luv lux!!!!!\n\n+\nThe coffeeeeee\nThe chai\nThe scrambled eggs\nThe hash\nThe lemon water jug\nThe furniture\nThe music\nThe croissants\n\n-\nSometimes hard to find seating\nNeed more salt shakers (lol but I am serious)
1;"I attended EDC 2014. One word: disappointed. You spend so much money, so much time preparing for EDC and what I got was definitely not what I expected. I'll stick the to events here in LA.\n\nComplaints:\n-On night 1 our shuttle driver took us about 20 minutes the wrong way. How does your shuttle driver not know where he's going? He didn't even inform us. We only realized something was wrong when he made several u-turns and someone decided to map our location. We were on the other side of the I-15. We left Excalibur around 6:30 and didn't arrive at the Speedway until past 9.\n-After night 1, the Excalibur shuttle \""line\"" was unorganized and packed. My group and dozens of other people were standing there until about 10AM. 5 hours? That's ridiculous. Everyone's exhausted, the sun is coming up fast and it's heating up. None of the officers or event coordinators offered an explanation as to why we were barely moving. Others were getting rowdy (I wonder why?) and I felt like a riot was going to break out. Thankfully they were giving out free water. Lol.\n-The crowd is RIDICULOUS. There is no room to move from stage to stage. I definitely feel that tickets were oversold, or security sucks if THAT much more people are sneaking in. \n\nI did enjoy the environment. Water stations were convenient, handled by workers. Pretty efficient considering there are thousands of people there. The fireworks and visuals were amazing. On the third day we came really early before the rest of the crowd. Only then could you really soak in and appreciate the grounds, the art, the food, the other entertainment. It all gets lost. The music was great. There's definitely something for everyone, although I wouldn't recommend having a set schedule. Trust me, nothing will go as planned."
4;"Having lived in France for over a decade, I can affirm that this place is pretty authentic. The soup was a Cream of Carrot that was quite tasty though a little too creamy for my taste. The entrec\u00f4tes were perfectly cooked, both the \""\u00e0 point\"" and the \""saignant\"", according to the French style. If you're looking for \""medium\"" or \""rare\"", you might want to ask for a little longer on the grill. The frites were just like in France, the salad was fresh, the dressing was authentic, and the wine list was great. The service was also friendly and attentive. And at that price, what more can one hope for? I'll be back."
4;I am totally enamored with this place.  Saw the sign a few weeks back while leaving Cafe Rio (across the street).  We are always looking for fun little places to take the kids for special treats but this is our new fave!  Atmosphere is simple and fun, the popcorn is delicious (my fave at the moment is the Chicago!) and the service has been amazing.  \n\nI've used the popcorn as a party favor for a baby shower and everyone opened their boxes and ate it right there at the party.  I don't think a single kernel made it to anyones home!  Their bags and tin would make excellent gifts as well.  \n\nDefinitely our new favorite place to go after dinner!  Or breakfast...but we are trying to set some good examples for our little guys.
3;The food is good, I usually go for the ultimo burrito.  They have a nice fresh salsa bar with peppers and limes.  They also give you a bag of chips to snack on with your food, which is nice while you wait for them to make your food.
1;a sports bar galore\ncold french fries make me so sad\neighteen dollars gone
2;Came here for lunch on the basis of the positive reviews. The food was great (we had a monte cristo, a tuna sandwich, eggs and a hot dog) good sized portions and excellent flavor. My beef with this place was the service. I really felt as though I was an inconvenience. I stood at the cash register to order - for what seemed like hours. I did the whole step in closer, clear my throat and shuffle papers around routine to try to get noticed. I was eventually helped but the service was poor. He was mumbling and I couldn't understand him and was getting annoyed when I asked for things to be repeated. He couldn't even bother to hand me my cups - just sat them on the cash register base. He sat down 3 cups and I had ordered 4 drinks. Went back to inquire about my 4th drink and he just pointed to the drink case. I guessed my 4th drink was in there. \n\nThere was a bright spot - an older gentleman who greeted us, brought us a high chair and bused the tables. He was uber friendly, helpful and the only redeeming human interaction we had while here. Give this man a raise!
2;3.5 stars\nHowie Burger was good but nothing earth shattering. I had great service and the ambience is nice. Nothing over the top though or that I would say you must visit while you are in Phx.
4;I love this place! I get the Remington every time - it's so good! These guys definitely know how make a sandwich the right way! Plenty of toppings that go from crust to crust and a huge variety of sandwich combinations! Oh yeah and you gotta love the little cookie that comes with!
2;You know, I never understood why Parrotheads get so excited about Jimmy Buffet.  After my first visit to Margaritaville... I still don't understand. I get it, it's a way of life or state of mind, a way to cut loose... but continuous videos of tailgating at Jimmy Buffet shows, with Chesney or Wilson thrown in every 10th video? Not for me. I'm sure a lot of people find this place to be like a little 'cheeseburger in paradise'. The atmosphere is kind of fun, but with a quoted 'one to two hour wait time', at a place that will not do reservations or call-ahead seating, it would be nice to have bigger bars to kill that wait time. The food is not bad. I will say the Volcanic Nachos were like manna from heaven, after we got seated, stacked THIIIIIS high with lots and lots of 'penos. My fish tacos were nothing to write home about, and the side of 'paradise' or something of that nature rice was... rice with carrots and peas. Huh. I have to say, though, I did not feel ripped off. The food wasn't stellar but at $10 for a good-sized helping, it was decent. My friends ordered other things and I really did not hear any raving. One person's steak was still mooing, after ordering it medium. \n\nService was really, really good. I wish I could do a separate 4 stars for the staff, they were awesome. I never had to ask for another drink, and our guy was incredibly patient while we waited for the rest of our party to show up after we had been seated. We did not feel rushed at all, and that means a lot in such a packed restaurant where others are obviously waiting still. They split our check without batting an eyelash. I tipped accordingly, you should too. These guys were facing a mosh pit with smiles on their faces. The balloon guy on stilts was a hoot (ask him to give you crabs if you go) and the live band was classic college alt rock, about 5 years after college. No one danced, which I thought was pretty funny. They didn't sound too bad. \n\nDefinitely a place for Parrotheads or those into doing the trendy theme restaurant thing. :)
1;"Caffe Lucano is a pretty standard Italian cafe on George IV bridge. Its only discerning feature is that the price of all the sandwiches and pastries is reduced by 50% after 3pm; this may sound like a great deal but neither the sandwiches nor the pastries are particularly memorable, and they're pretty expensive to start off with. If you're in need of fortification at this late stage in the afternoon, you'd be better off going to the pub for a pint. \n\nThe staff are rather cold towards the customers, and the warm friendly welcome that you would expect from an Italian cafe is nowhere to be found. They're also really arsey about their student discount; when my boyfriend went to the counter to pay the bill, they only gave him the discount when he showed my student card too. \n\nThis is not somewhere I'll be in any hurry to visit again."
1;It took a very long time for the meals to be served. Also, the food is not worth the price IMO.
2;Oh, Dai-Sing... I don't really know what to think. As a stop-in after shopping at the Asian Mall you're great, you're entertaining, you have some awesome items, and you give me a good laugh with some of the products you carry... as a functional restaurant supply store? I don't know who would choose to stock up here but you do carry a lot of items that could help a business... at retail prices. (Serious customers would probably have more luck at restaurant depot)\n\nAfter you pass the mass of scales, pirate ship clocks, sinks, and incense along the right hand side there are boxes and boxes of paper products, to go containers, etc on the first aisle along with random cooking ingredients (bulk wasabi powder right next to gallons of Louisiana hot sauce). As you continue to the left you'll pass plenty of cooking utensils, heating elements, signage, faucets, tabletop accessories (syrup containers, shakers, ketchup & mustard bottles) and grinders ending on a last aisle of glassware and china. The back of the store is lined with cleaning supplies, trash bins, and chemicals, but as you make your way back to the front they have an array of chef outfits and accessories as you hit the knife counter. At a glance nothing seemed extremely well made for the price, but I didn't browse too hard.  \n\nI could be missing something, of course. Since I have purchased some items but have never inquired about wholesale/bulk items I might be out of the loop. Most of the staff spoke English perfectly... I just see this as more of a small purchase store than an actual large supplier.
0;"Worst experience I've ever had in Charlotte ! The owner has no sense of customer experience ! \n\nThey won't honor your groupon ! Told me that if I would have set one table over I could have used it ... Knowing I purchased it while setting in their booth ! \n\nAlso, asked for 3 things that never showed up on my table, had to ask for them 3 to 4 times and he still charged me. Told them I'm not coming back and he says \""ok\"" ..."
3;Great Food!  \n\nI normally HATE going to Filipino restaurants.  The food is usually  tasteless and/or has been sitting out for hours.  They always pale in comparison to my family's home cooked food.  But THIS PLACE has really GOOD food.  The lechon was full of flavor and crispy, yet juicy.  I also had the whole fried tilapia, which was delicious.  We also tried the kare-kare.  I couldn't believe it was flavorful!\n\nThe Halo-Halo Especial was chock full of goodies.\n\nThe atmosphere is kinda funny.  I think that the restaurant doubles as a karaoke bar in the evenings.  They had a full bar.  But I don't care, because the food was GOOD!\n\n\nCan't speak to the panict bihon or pancit lug-lug...will have to try that next time.
0;Nice staff.Dirty. There was fecal matter on my shower curtin. Cleanliness is not a priority here.  Hotwire is the reason for all my problems. I will never do name your own price.
3;I really enjoy this spot, and on top of that anything by this same company (Block 16, they run Barrymore, Public House, and more). Trendy, good people watching, fast service, unique and good food is always a solid mix for a Vegas restaurant. \n\nMy favorite shakes are the Green Grasshopper, a minty and chocolatey mix of wonderfulness and the straight Oreo. I love the burgers, I've had a bunch of them and I believe the Rising sun and the Steak/Mushroom burger are both delivered to this planet from some culinary god.\n\nThere are a few drawbacks though, price is one. Pretty expensive, but its what you expect for being in one of the upper class casinos. My GF got the Ahi tuna sliders and they were a JOKE, not good and cost something like $15. Also it has a very club like atmosphere, don't come here expecting a romantic dinner or anything, this is a bar scene more than a restaurant.\n\nStick with the Burgers and Shakes here and you can't go wrong. Stray out of those categories and you may be disappointed. Overall this is one of my favorite spots in town, also because the Cosmo rocks and the chandelier bar is right next door.
0;Not a good showroomif you are in a wheelchair. My friend got stuck in the wheelchair lift and we never saw the show. They refunded my tickets for $183 but the billed me for $411. They admit that this was a mistake but they have not sent a letter to MC and corrected the mistake.
4;This is by far the best bakery in the Plateau! I discovered this magnificent little gem on my way to a weekly commitment I had just two blocks from here. It is so charming and old world, just passing through the threshold will transport you back 100 years. I highly recommend the spinach quiche! But decide for yourself which one is best, try them all! The seasonal tarts are to die for. My husband and I believe that the croissant are perhaps the best in all of Montreal. Unfortunately, there is no outdoor seating and there are very few tables and chairs available inside. But what Boulangerie Kouing Amman lacks in space it certainly makes up for in bake goods!
1;I went with my girlfriend and we were both excited about the restaurant because there isn't many Taiwanese food joints in the area.  \n\nWe went in, the waiter took us to the table.  Service is at best a 3.  Not entirely her fault due to the joint having only 1 server.  \n\nThe food:  at best a 4 and at worst a 1.   I feel generous about giving them a 3 rating because I haven't tried everything on their menu.  Nonetheless, everything was ok, but missing some major flavor component that makes Taiwanese food good (although I can't put my finger on it).   We ate the pancake (2), pork rice dish (4), the beef noodle (2.5), the simmered beef cold dish (4), wrapped rice (1), and a couple of drinks.
3;I've loved this Thai place for years. Best Chicken Satay I've had since I left So Cal! Good lunch specials with soup and such. Personal favorites include Spicy Basil Dish, Pad Thai and Red Curry.
2;I would be later coming home from a play Saturday afternoon and I decided to give Applebee's a call and do a Carside to Go.  I called and ordered a 2 for $20.  I ordered the mozzarella sticks for the appetizer and I got the Fiesta Lime chicken for my wife and I got the three cheese chicken penne for myself.  They told me it would be twenty minutes.  \n\nAs it turned out, traffic moved well along Charleston heading west and I was at Applebee's in about 10 minutes.  Rather than wait in the car, I went in to let them know I was there and to pay.\n\nThe young man working the carside said it would be ready soon and then went to pull the order in the computer.  He couldn't find it and needed to get his manager.  As this was happening, Josh got the order ready but the manager still couldn't retrieve it.  Rather than have me wait, she told me she'd find it later and I should just take the meals home and she wished me a Merry Christmas.  I was taken back by her kindness.\n\nI brought the food home and we both enjoyed our dinners very much.  The chicken is a dish my wife has gotten almost every time we've gone to an Applebee's and it was a treat to have it again.  The penne was very good.  It had some red pepper that gave it a nice kick.  \n\nThe next day, I was still upset by getting free meals so I went back to pay.  The same manager came to talk to me and assure me it was OK the way things were.  I made up for it by giving Josh a good tip to share with the servers and kitchen staff.  Merry Christmas to them.
0;We made a special trek out here for Montreal's supposed best brew pup, only to be told: children not allowed. \n\nMaybe it's a cultural difference, since in my hometown (Philly) the slow, 5-6pm hours are when urban parents like me bring our well-managed kids with us to brewpubs to enjoy a pint and a meal with friends. It's pretty shocking to be told you aren't welcome in an establishment.
4;Went with wife and two kids for dinner.  We had a great time. The food was delicious, service was great and ambiance just right.  Go here!  You will not be disappointed
1;I mean, its a Wal-Mart ya'll. The only thing different with this location is the pain getting back onto Independence, I can not imagine all of the brilliant car accidents that will occur with people trying to leave.
1;We had a cheese pizza, wings and fries delivered.  The pizza was awful, dry, overcooked.  The wings and fries were actually really good. Overall I regret the experience for the money spent.
0;The most yuppiest biker bar in the valley.. They hate the locals in cave creek and only cater to the yuppie big wheel bagger crowd from phoenix, locals should not give this scumbag POS one single dime!!
2;I got what I expected when I went to this restaurant......above average deep dish Chicago style pizza. I really liked the atmosphere of the sports bar/pizza joint. This would be a great place to go to watch the game. All in all the food is good, but slightly overpriced in my opinion.
4;Hob nob's makes you wish for more locally-owned businesses that value customer service as much as they value the quality of their products. Went here twice during my weekend in Phoenix and had a lovely experience both times. The decor and set up make you feel like you've stepped into the home of an old fried who also makes really awesome coffee and pastries. Indoor and outdoor seating are equally great and cozy. The main room (with the fire place, uhh cute!) hosts a variety of local art that's for sale. We found this out after admiring the painting parallel to the pastry case and jokingly making an offer for it. It was the only one not for sale as it was a replica of a puzzle the owners children had put together. We had two different baristas/cashiers both times I went and both were just as friendly and kind!\n\nDidn't get to try any of the salads or sandwiches but everything looked and smelled amazing! The ambience was the selling point for me though. Coming from Vegas where customer service is anything but and based on the highest bidder, it was nice to have a consistent experience (even if it was only twice) that made me feel special and prompted me to check out some real estate in the area so I could have the Hob Nob's experience on a weekly basis (only half kidding....)
0;Crabby cashier...Evelyn..?...Didn't greet me. Didn't speak to me through my entire transaction. Heck, she didn't even tell me the total!! Hello??? When there are 4 grocery stores equal distance from my house, you really should be nice or at the very least, talk to your customers!!
0;I have used Maggiano's for meeting functions for over 10 years.  This location is in need of understanding customer service.  I miss the excellent service received from Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, and Houston locations.  I won't use this location anymore for my meetings when held in Las Vegas.  I don't think that any of the banquet staff have ever attended a meeting to know what needs and expectations are needed to fulfill a successful event.  I wish them the best...I am moving on.
0;I wish I could give this -stars I went in go get contacts everything was great I got a trial pair and they said they will order them and come back in two weeks and they said they accepted my insurance I called back in two weeks the lady working the doctors desk proceeded to tell me I didn't order any, so I said can I get a new trail pair , she said yes come in and get them...so I left home and went down there I got there and tried to order my contact and she said you'll have to pay 100% of the contacts price, I called my insurance company and the man on the phone said my insurance covers it and that maybe they don't want to do business with me here. So I told the lady it covers and she said well it says I have no reason to lie to you and she showed me the paper and I said I guess you don't want to do business with me and I got a copy of my exam and they gave it to me and I left. I went to LensCrafters and they said my insurance covers and I got my contacts. Don't go to this piece of shit place the people are very rude here
0;"I called to ask for an acrylic fill and i was given a 12pm appointment.  It was 15 minutes away so I RUSHED down there.  Ended up sitting while other people were taken.  Finally got sat down awkwardly 1 foot from someone getting her nails done to wait some more.  The guy said she was busy with others and asked what I needed.  I said \""acrylic fill\"" and he couldn't understand what I was talking about.  Finally, they tell me they don't do acrylic fills and cannot help me.  I told them I called and she said she never said they did acrylic fills but that she needed to see my nails.  I complained.  She then said they only do PINK acrylic fills, I said that was fine, I don't care what color it is.  She stared at me not understanding what I was saying.  So I said never mind and left.\n\nTerrible customer service.  Will never go there again!!!"
3;Went here for brunch this morning and it was so worth it. My fianc\u00e9e had the Farmers Breaky and I enjoyed the FML Burrito (plus a side of bacon). Great food all around - good service and a great dining area.
0;"Was too tired to drive from hotel to a restaurant so tried Jack's! Had \""tasteless\"" Cattleman Chicken; advise \""drive to a real restaurant like Montana's!"
1;I will not be back. I've been here 3 times because they are so close to my house, each time trying to see if maybe I'm wrong. Well 3 strikes you're out. The pancakes had way to much baking soda or powder and the omelets are overcooked. The only thing that was good was the sip of mimosa I had. Not impressed.
0;"Absolutely awful. Luckily we got our money back for our skates/rink access. \n\nThere is absolutely no advertising for the rink that you must reserve a fire pit. When we got there, the bar confirmed that the pits were first come, first serve. So we wait for a group to leave their pit, but when we walk up there to sit we were told by a server it was reserved by someone for 6:30 (we were told this at 6:00). What reservations? There is no reservation phone number on their website, and there is clearly nothing stopping anyone from siting wherever they want. So IF there actually are reservations, and we made one, we would have to ruin some family's night by kicking them out of \""our\"" table, since none of the pits are roped off or have any indication of being exclusive. \n\nBy 6:50 nobody was at that pit still. Another pit had been broken the entire time we were there, with maintenance supposedly on the way. They never showed before we finally left the hotel. Every employee at the rink, bar and otherwise, gave us the run around about both the \""reservations\"" and the maintenance. The bar will tell you to ask the rental place, and vice versa. So we spent our whole time there sitting at a broken pit. None of the staff there has a clue what they are doing or how to answer questions. \n\nOne family who had claimed a fire pit had a horde of children who would regularly pile their empty skates in the middle of the walking space by those particular 3 fire pits. A large pile that every passing person would have to leap/trip over all night. Management clearly doesn't care about liability. \n\nWe got maybe 5-10 minutes of skating time, after the sealing debacle. $45 for 10 minutes at most. Why? They had to take 40 minutes to clean the ice. The last 10-15 minutes were the staff pretending to clean/polish the ice, because some sap had to propose to his girlfriend on the empty ice before they let anyone back on. So we were stuck waiting around for these people to show up and their 'special moment' to get under way. Was it necessary to inconvenience 100 people/families? You can't do that crap at the end of the evening for the final polishing or maybe after closing? Clearly the rink is willing to make such arrangements, so there must have been a better way.\n\nSuch a waste for such a small rink and so few fire pits (a grand total of...5). If I even attempt to go again, which I most likely won't, I definitely won't be paying them money for meager s'more kits (ill bring my own) and I won't reserve any hope for a fire pit. I'll attempt a reservation but there's clearly no way to enforce it. We will also apparently have to plan for being there for 4 hours to account for personal announcements and exaggerated cleaning time."
2;I have been to the Vig a few times, and I I think it is hit or miss.  It is not a blow your taste bud experience and  I do think it is a tab bit overpriced for what you get.  However, for a great happy hour, drinking with friend taking advantage of Arizona weather this is  a great place.  \n\nThe atmosphere is modern but a little laid back, but then again it would have to be if you have boccie ball!  The patio is were it is at, and I think there are more tables outside then inside.  There is also an additional bar in the back.  \n\nFood:  Overall the food is good, it is no blow your mind food but there are some strong items, I have had the following:\n\nApps:\nSalmon plate - I really liked this\nCrab and Artichoke dip - They use Crab with a C not with a K :)\nDinner:\nCarne asada on a potato pancake - This is my fav dish here, bug fan of cotija cheese and gives the dish a great balance\nAchiote Salmon and Chorizo Arepa - very nice spice\nSteak Salad - I was actually a little disappointed with this dish, I think the salad dressing was great but the steak was overcooked and not enough cheese\n\nI haven't tried the brunch but I am interested in what they offer.  I think that if you are looking for a chill outside bar with modern bar food the Vig is a fantastic choice.  \n\nThe valet is a bit overkill - I can walk 10 feet to a front door, I think the valet comes into play because sometimes it is hard to get a parking spot, really is a bit unnecessary but then again I guess they are creating jobs.
0;I really hate this place. It reminds me of a costco or a shitter version of walmart. Its really industrial and sterile and the food quality isn't the best. The produce isn't bad  if you know what your doing . The meat is another story . Its real low quality stuff . And the seafood is inedible. ITs old and smelly half the time. \n\nThe redeeming feature of this big box of horrors is the bulk bins. Think of a dry good and you'll find it here. Beans , different kids of sugars , and flours , snack food seeds.Literally any dry good you could want is here.  \ni hate tihs place but the bulk bins ... they save it and keep me coming ... god damn my love of baking
3;Stumbled upon this place during my lunch break today! Quiet place with not many people there. Loved the atmosphere, it had wide spaces with comfy chairs. I ordered a vanilla iced coffee with half and half and it was instantly one of my favorites! It was not too sweet and also so incredibly smooth. It was only $3.35 for a large which is including the $1 towards the vanilla syrup. Not bad at all! \n\nMy friend got a pastry, the apricot streudel which she was less than impressed with - but it did look like their pastries may have been bought rather than made in-house? I am not 100% on that one. We did see two girls order crepe's though which looked fantastic and not overly priced! It is definitely on my list for must try.
2;Jet is only open on Friday, Saturday and Monday. \n  It's an unusual setup appearing to be designed to serve as much alcohol as possible.  The main area is a huge rectangle with the bars extending from front to back along both sides.  The bottle service tables are in the the middle section on both ends with the dance area in the middle of the middle section.   Did you get that?   There is a back room with another bar and small dance floor with more bottle service tables.  It might be easier to get a drink back here. \n On Monday, Industry Night, it's just too damn crowded.   There's not too much happening on Monday's but it's just too crazy here.
3;I like Paradise Bakery for their sandwiches. Their pasta salads are okay. However I find them to lack flavor. The cookies are baked fresh daily and I have tried the chocolate chip cookies, oatmeal raisin, and peanut butter. All three are good if you are into sweets. I am disappointed in the fact that they do not offer a herbal tea. They have three different tea flavors and none of them are herbal.
0;We recently went to Zink at Southpark for a birthday dinner. I have previously been to both dinner and brunch at the uptown location and thought the food was excellent. Unfortunately our most recent visit was far from exceptional. Our waitress Ellie was fantastic but the chef left little to be desired. The lobster Mac and cheese was completely dry the first time we received it. After sending it back it was then watery and the lobster was rubbery making the dish basically inedible. It tasted as though they added some sauce to our first dish and reheated it in the microwave to warm it up. You should never have to chew on lobster for\n30 seconds to eat it. One us got salmon that was cooked well but the risotto was bland and not creamy. To top it all off both steaks we ordered were not cooked at the proper temperature. The only saving grace was the bacon wrapped meatloaf with braised short rib which was great. Overall it was a disappointing meal for a special occasion and we will not be coming back.
3;i stayed here  during a recent trip  and found it  quite nice ! \nfirst i have to say thanks to the  front desk as they upgraded me to a suite  upon check in  which was very nice - i had a great view of the  Belagio fountains  from the 29th floor  a corner suite ! \nthe room was immaculate  and kept  clean  all during my stay  and i got clean sheets  without question  when i requested them .\nthe only problem i had was that the air conditioning made the  room extreemly  DRY   and i was forever trying to invent ways to get humidity into the air  by wetting towels  and filling the tub with water ... and nothing seemed to work  LOL ! \nalso  it was a little bit of a walk  to get to the monirail  on which i was dependent for transportation to and from the convention hotel. i had to navagate both the Paris and  Balleys  to get to the monorail \nkudos to  room service !  i ordered breakfast one morning and they were  PROMPT !  i had food in ten minutes  flat !
4;Went to Nagoya last night for one of my closest friends' 22nd Birthday dinner and man I was impressed.  Located across from the Lodge on Rainbow and Windmill is a hidden hot spot for sushi & Korean BBQ.  The restaurant has a full sushi bar, bar, dinning area, and private BBQ rooms.\n\nWent on a Tuesday night and the place was pretty slow, however, one of our friends has eaten there before and the sushi chef just kept making roll after roll after platter haha.  By the time all was said and done our group of about twenty people hand all the sushi we could handle.  \n\nThe all-you-can eat pricing is reasonable and the sushi is fantastic, add a great location that is easy to drive to and a friendly staff and you have my vote everyday!
2;"Sad to say but I was kinda disappointed.  In Boomin Spot's defense, I have been spoiled from SoCal's amazing hot pot restaurants.\n\nThe lamb skewers were indeed very delicious.  I think they were 3 skewers for $6.  \n\nI ordered the Lamb Hot Pot.  It was ok.  Spice level was good but it had too much junk in it.  I had 3 slices of lamb.  Maybe 4.  Again, there was so much junk...it took some time to find my meat!  They overdid it with the pickled cabbage.  There were 3 or 4 small tofu squares, some mushrooms, intestines and one fishball (fishball was yummy).  I asked them to leave out the pork blood but there were still a few cubes in my pot.  \n\nThey have a sauce \""bar\"".  Basically a wooden book shelf with metal containers of the essential sauces.  I mix almost everything together....peanut sauce, garlic, sa cha, green onions....and whatever tastes good.  I usually add an egg to my sauce but I didn't see any at the sauce \""bar\"".\n\nI would still recommend people to check this place out but just don't have high expectations."
0;Me and my husband are going to stay at Paris Hotel for our Anniversary in May so why not have dinner at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant?! Bad idea! I called the reservation's number and asked for a window table since it was going to be a special date. We would not be flying all the way from NC to have a special night in Las Vegas if it was not a really special date for us and we would like to have a perfect night! Anyway, the girl that answered the phone was very rude and was in a hurry to end the call. She said: We cannot choose the table. You will have to talk to the Maitre when you arrive at the restaurant. And I replied: But if there is not window table when we arrive? It's a special date and we would like to make sure we would get a window table. Then, she said she was only responsible to make the reservation and not for which table we were going to sit and tried to hang up the phone. So I canceled the reservation and sent the restaurant an e-mail requesting a table view and explaining that it was our Anniversary and that I have called the restaurant before but only got a rude person on the phone. I was hoping to finally get someone nice since I had very high expectations for this restaurant but it was not the case. They sent me a rude e-mail with no apologize and confirming that they could not reserve the window table! We decided, then, to choose another restaurant where we are going to be able to have a staff that are more sensitive to our needs. It is unbelievable and stupid that a fine restaurant like Eiffel Tower would act like that. After all no one is gonna pay a $300 bill to be treated like crap! Specially in a special date like an Anniversary when the least thing you are caring is how much the bill is gonna be! So, shame on them! We are going to spend our money somewhere else!
4;YUMMMMMYYYY!!!!!  Loved the huge gyro and the side salad was delish.  Super friendly staff, nice and clean too :-)
3;Tried the Sage fried chicken Benedict due to the Man vs Food recommendation. Kids had the blueberry pancakes. Way too much biscuit for the Benedict but the taste was good and portions were pretty amazing. Great service too.
0;Terrible. That is one word to describe this place. Terrible service, beds, pillows, etc. Don't waste your time. Trust me. I wish I can give them 0 stars.
4;Signed up for training with professional and knowledgable trainer, Andre today!\nLooking forward to a great You Fit experience. Super helpful at the front desk. Clean and no pressure atmosphere. Thanks!
4;Ok I say this every time, but I do not like to make a habit of giving a place 5 stars in my first try, but at Fate I can't help myself. Everything from the ambiance, food, happy hour, beer, and even cake pops were simply amazing!!,\n\nI'll start with my favorite, beer. We got here early during happy hour and thought that my wife and I would order 2 beers each. So I ordered the Smoked Porter and she had Imperial IPA. Trying these I would say the imperial IPA was really good. 8.5 100lbu. Very tasty! The smoked porter was great too. Not really my thing but with food it tasted good. A little on the over smoked flavor but I respect that. After we had the pale ale and Irish Red. The pale ale was 6.0 and it was more on par of average IPA.  The Irish Red was amazing! A strong but refreshing red. This was my wife's favorite beer. Mine has to be the imperial IPA. \n\nDuring HH we ordered the pizza bread very good. Basically cheese bread on their pizza dough. It came with a side of marinara. I would total order it again next time we are at HH\n\nWe then decided to order a pizza to share. We chose the rustic pizza which including artichoke hearts, fennel,sausage, gorgonzola cheese. I thought it was excellent pizza! Even better with a craft beer next to you. \n\nAnyways our experience at Fate was excellent. Id like to add that the service was excellent and liked the layout of the restaurant and the small brew tanks. This place is small but seems like a lot of room at the bar and a decent sized patio.  \n\nOh one more thing, when we were walking out, my wife spotted the cake pop display. We had to turn around and ordered 2! 2 bucks each and well worth it!! We tried the sinker doodle and peppermint red velvet. The red velvet was the best! A little harder shell but once you ate more they were very moist. Do your self a favor and order at least one on your way out!!
0;Phone guy was RUDE!  Should probably consider providing better service when you have epic Papa Dels to compete with.
4;HANDS DOWN BEST BURGER AND FRIES IN LAS VEGAS!!!! omygosh you just have to try them out yourselves to prove it! you're not gonna regret it!! hahaha! one massive heart attack served at ya! hahaha!  and never ever ever ever everrr miss out on their garlic fries! like i told ya! itz zee bezzt!!!
2;"When considering what downtown has to offer, Nacho Daddy isn't on my top list of restaurants. However, this spot does delivers on what it promises: decent Mexican food and great drinks in a fun atmosphere. \n\nThe restaurant is pretty small, a fully stocked bar sits across from a stage next to a separate dining room. Nacho Daddy regularly features musical performers and artists which really helps reflect what DTLV has been focusing on for the past years.  The food is similar to the Henderson location, but seemingly in smaller portions. The street tacos are delicious and the Thai chicken nachos are a great twist and a must-try dish. Splurge on the deep-fried ice cream, its worth it!  The bar gets extra points for serving up margaritas in mason jars! Though the food is pretty good I thought it was overpriced; $14 for nachos? $10 for margaritas? Meh. \n\nService was pretty friendly on our visit though the bartenders seemed to be slacking on the drinks. Our margaritas were too sweet and they weren't that generous with the tequila. Though I'm not opposed to future visits, they are more worthy places in DTLV."
3;New update:  Carly's has become my to go lunch place away from downtown.  I've gotten really sick of eating at the Butcher (The arrogant butcher that is) and now I like coming here for a pannini or salad.  The orzo salad always needs a bit more salt, but if you get a side of their really tasty balsamic vinagrette (which tastes good on basically everything) you'll be fine.  Oh, I also always order the pannini on focaccia rather than the ciabatta as the ciabatta can get a little too hard or overcrisped for my taste.  For brunch, its still meh.
1;I was here to have a tire changed due to a nail that had gotten stuck.  The staff was not professional and the tire was overpriced as I found out later.  They also tried to up sell me on a tire rotation and a few other things.   Chain store service, maybe you'll get someone know actually knows what they're doing but I will definitely not be back.
2;Came here on a Saturday night about 9 ish with 2 friends. We couldn't find any place to eat without a long wait or prior reservations, so we popped a squat in the lounge area. \n\nA cute Filipina waitress with more shakes and buns than what is served here helped us with a smile, trying to squeeze herself into her little dress. That is how all the waitresses dress here, actually, a lot like the girls that eat here, in tight short dresses. At this time of night, it makes sense, because right across the hall is the Marquis Night Club, the main late-night-place-to-be at the Cosmopolitan, especially if you look 19 and Asian.\n\nWe ordered simple little meals as follows:\nRed Stripe - $7\nDragon Fruit Drink - $10\nBlack and White Shake - $8\nArtichoke Guacamole app with chips $9\nTruffle Lobster $16.50\nPizza Twinkies $12\nMini Holstein Sliders (2) - $9\n\nThe Black and White was great, reminded me of Fenton's Creamery in Oakland, with both chocolate and white chocolate mini malt balls on top. \nThe Artichoke Guac was meh. The sliders were tasty, but puny in size. Pizza Twinkies looked like 2 large Geno Pizza Rolls.  \n\nThe meal totaled $77.29 with tax, for nothing very filling or completely satisfying. When you throw in a tip, that is nearly $100 for a 3 way snack. \n\nI tried to fill up on eye candy though. And it was entertaining to see the people in line across the hall herded into the club like cattle, first being branded (ID check) then shuffled through roped holding pens, then stampeding into the meat packing plant.
2;I honestly only come here for the boba..\nService I don't care for, because well.. They don't give service at all.. If you're dining in, they take your order, bring your food and that's the last you see of them.\n\nTheir menu has varieties of the smoothies, teas, shaved ice and foods. My favorite items would be Taro Smoothie and their Chicken Wings. The other items and drinks are not too bad.\n\nWas never disappointed with food and drinks but the service sucks!
4;Very good food. Flavorful and fresh. The customer service is excellent. Best Chinese I have had in the 17 years I've been in Vegas.
0;Never, ever again will I give this outfit a single dollar.   Within the last few months, either when it came to ordering flooring, questions on lighting, etc, there is never anyone in the department that I needed, but many people from other departments that couldn't answer the appropriate questions.  I used to work for a big home improvement place, you're supposed to have at least one person from every department in there at all times, not here.  When I complained to the manager, you'd think he would have ordered the flooring himself, but no, he just wanted to try to find someone else to order it for me (I ALREADY TRIED THAT!!) I would have only given this location a bad review, but when I tried the one in 7 Hills, they tried overcharging me drastically on items, prices that rang up were different from prices that were marked on the product.  Sorry Lowes-  Never again!!!
4;Dude, I didn't want to go to Lens Crafters.  I'd only ever gone to eye doctors you had to make appointments for and gotten designer glasses.  I didn't want to go replace my Salvatore Ferragamos with some knockoff brand.  But, I'd decimated my Ferragamos beyond repair.  I couldn't see.  I needed glasses, well, in about an hour.  That, plus my insurance covered it.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised.  I was in and out of the exam quickly with my new prescription in hand, and I actually had to take pictures of myself in about 6 different pairs of glasses and message them to my best girlfriend to choose them.  I liked SO many!  They carried a lot of lines that I liked, and although they didn't have the same Ferragamos, I ended up with a pair I loved.\n\nI had to go back to get glasses recently, and I went to Lens Crafters again.  Same thing - in and out quickly, and I left the mall with a pair of Dolce & Gabbanas that look like they're from a boutique, but I paid a little less than retail for them.  Superawesome.
1;This Comfort Inn is just a place to lay your head for a night's sleep in North Las Vegas. Located along a busy thoroughfare, it is especially difficult in the morning commute hours to make a left on Cheyenne Avenue to go east toward the freeway. The Inn is clean and simple. The room air conditioners are exceptionally noisy. The complimentary breakfast is the same at all the Comfort Inns: cold cereal, instant oatmeal, fruit, breads (all white), hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, juices and coffee/tea.
0;This place is terrible.\n\nNice location.  Terrible atmosphere and service.  If you feel like hanging out with the service staff and their friends, and feel like you are at a party where you don't know anyone and you are not welcomed, if you like to pay more than you should for your food and drinks, then you got to go to Guido's.
1;"BOTTOM LINE:  Three floors of cocktail lounge serving high priced libations that clock in between $12 and $18 all under the umbrella, literally, of a beaded curtain to resemble a giant crystal chandelier. This is Las Vegas, after all.\n\nOur  first reaction of \""isn't this cool\"" when we first saw the Chandelier Bar changed to \""we won't come back here\"" as a result of experince with poor cocktail quality and service on the second floor. \n\nWe're glad we went to check out The Chandelier Bar since it had so much buzz. It was worth a single visit. But overall, for a very good cocktail at The Cosmo with good service and a choose your own table seating format, we'd recommend the Vesper Bar in the lobby.  For a great cocktail with stellar service and views, although at a bit higher prices, we think you'd be much better off walking over to the Mandarin Oriental and the cocktail lounge there. \n\nDifferent strokes for different folks.  Fortunately  Las Vegas has a plethora of good cocktail bar options. The Chandelier isn't one of them.\n\n\""ISN'T THIS COOL\"" elements:\n\n1 ENGINEERING INTEREST: . The top two floors of Chandelier bar are enclosed in drapes of literally a couple of million crystal beads. (See close up photo.) Even for those who are of the age to have seen many, many crystal beaded curtains when they were the thing during our college years, this tops them all. What most amazed me as design and engineering is that one of the friendly security staff said he was working the week this was erected and they came in and placed each segment perfectly, not needing to take down and redo even one. \n\n2, EACH FLOOR UNIQUE: You may want to browse all three levels of the Chandelier before you settle in and order something. Whether you use the interior glass surrounded staircase to navigate between levels or the glass enclosed elevator that is just outside the bar. \n\nEach floor has its' own specialty cocktail menu and its' own vibe. The first floor, adjacent to the casino gaming area is open, bright if that's what appeals to you. The second floor is more dark with the sense of being enveloped by the crystal strands. (This eems the \""see and be seen\"" spot. ) The third floor seems more intimate for folks having, ummm,  conversations. \n\n3. MIX OF PEOPLE: Maybe it's because we were at Chandelier bar at mid week or  because it was an earlier hour of about 8 pm, but neither the second nor third floor bars had many people in them. And if f you're intimidated about trying these locations due to the buzz about The Cosmopolitan in general  and in particular this bar being the gathering place for only young, beautiful hard body types, don't be. Speaking from our experience throughout the Cosmo and at this bar too, there was mix of folks of all ages and styles. \n\n \""WE WON'T COME BACK HERE\"" elements.\n\n1. POOR QUALITY PRICEY COCKTAILS: the ones we ordered at the second floor bar were expensive (about $14 for a Manhattan as example) and not very good. Hubby dubbed his Manhattan one of the worst ever in thirty years of enjoying the same.  Served too warm and too much vermouth.\n\n2.  POOR SERVICE:  I wanted an Irish Coffee but was told there was no coffee \""at this level\"" and the option suggested to me was Bailey's Irish Creme served up as it was \""basically the same\"" said the waitress. That's not even close was my reply. Well, she said, we could send a runner to another floor for coffee \""...if you insist but it will be cold when it gets here.\""  As a result, , I ordered a second floor specialty drink, a \""Campfire\"" that was served with three charred marshmallows across the top. \n\nMy bad. So was the drink. \n\nWe didn't finish either cocktail. They were simply huge, alcohol bombs. From our perspective, a good cocktail is about finesse. Not here. \n\nAs aside,I'll say the poor service here stood out as sub par because our experience over a couple of days at The Cosmo's other facilities was that staff was uber friendly staff and helpful.. \n\n3. SNOOTY SEATING: Another tun off for us about the Chandelier's second floor was the seating hostess set up as you entered to guide you to a table. In our case, although the place was nearly empty, we were walked to a bad table in a dark corner. When we said we'd prefer to sit in the middle of the little occupied room, we were escorted there. We were nicely dressed, but still perhaps not the age demographic the Chandelier Bar is trying to encourage? Regardless, being offered one of the worst tables in the nearly empty place didn't start us out feeling good about the experience."
4;808 car audio evolution has by far the best prices in town for your car security needs. Court was very helpful and knowledgeable on the alarms that he showed me.  Because of the benefits, I decided to go with the alarm with the remote start feature! Court finished my car in the time that he told me! I was really impressed with the service that he and his employee Jon gave.  \n\nI would highly recommend 808 car audio evolution to my family, friends, and  fellow yelp users for the best prices, best service, and quality work.
1;After staying at the cosmopolitan, this place was the pits.  There were a bunch of signs everywhere saying that service was their signature but it was probably on the worst to low end of service I received at a hotel.  First of all, the room key machine wasn't working and they said they'd bring them right up.  They never came and I had to call and request them.  I was also starving when I checked in and tried to order room service but I was on hold for over 30 minutes so I gave up.  I had to take a conference call and was stranded without food!\n\nNo real amenities at this hotel versus others on the strip.  Just a bare bones place to stay that is pretty nice.  I wouldn't come back here given the choice.
0;"Grade: Pure Evil\n\nThe blood or mysterious \""red crust\"" on the beer bottles was a real bad sign..."
2;I come here for Dim Sum on Sundays.  The food is good, but sometimes it can be hard to get the right stuff to come around and last week my friend had to ask several times to get an order of steamed pork dumplings.\n\nI haven't been to Dim Sum on Central though so this is my only Dim Sum experience.
2;Nice classic dishes with a nice classic decor. A little pricy IMO but that's to be expected with a restaurant like this. The service is nice and management is always present on the floor. I only wish the food was as entertaining as the service or as pleasing as elegant as the decor.
4;"Love this!  I am a fairly active and fit guy.  I mostly do running, calisthenics, circuit training, and cross-fit.  I enjoy hikes, half-marathons, obstacle racing, skiing, and snowboarding.  I also did plenty of surfing growing up in Huntington Beach, CA.\n\nPrior to coming to class, I knew the biggest workout in real surfing is battling against the incoming surf to get out the where the waves are breaking.  It takes lots of stamina, endurance, and explosive shoulders, back, and triceps power to successfully get to a wave and drop into it.  So I envisioned Surfset as something pretty light weight without all that water and waves.\n\nWell, I was thoroughly impressed after just 1 Surfset class.  I did a \""mixed\"" session, and broke a good sweat.  I really like how it incorporated cardio, calisthenic, core strengthening, and stretching exercises onto an unstable platform.  The addition of balance is something I don't do enough of outside of specific sports.  The kick-ass part of all this is that it forces you to engage more muscles, in particular your core.  So the same exercises done on a floor end up burning more calories when done on an unstable platform.  It also helps develop and maintain your proprioception, which is that sense of your body parts, muscles, and strengths relative to a particular movement.  Another nice thing about Surfset is that is it simply fun."
4;"Wanted to impress friends in town from Hawaii and Mon Ami Gabi wowed them (and me)!  Stopped in for early dinner, luckily with reservations.  By the time we left, both patio and dining room were filled, with a line out the door--and it was a Monday!  Service was very attentive and our server was a treasure trove of knowledge (we know what the Gabi is about); the tomato fennel soup was creamy and flavorful, poured steaming from a kettle; and the chocolate bread pudding irresistible.  Putting this on the gotta-come-back list!"
2;I can't say too much about this airport, but I know their restrooms are clean! That is a huge plus for me.\n\nBad thing is the terminal I was in had a poor variety of food. :(
2;It's just like every other Chili's. Nothing special but I have NOTHING to complain about. I wouldn't tell anyone they HAVE to go here because who seriously hasn't been to a Chili's before. We always get the 2 for $20.
4;Finally! This is the buffet that we deserve in the university. My wife and I have been waiting for this place to open and it was well worth every nail-biting moment. \n\nAs we have been to the same building in several of it's earlier incarnations (same decor, different name) we were pleasantly surprised by the new look coming in. Very classy, very Asian, but not overdone like many Chinese buffets, like they are try to convince you beyond a shadow of a doubt that you are in a Chinese place.\n\nIts new still so it was fairly slow. We were brought to a table a put in our drink order. Then it was buffet time!\n\n How do you say awesome in Chinese? I really don't care but that's what it was. The layout is not overcrowded with Americanized versions of Asian foods. Its laid out in smaller portions on white plates so that it gets changed over frequently and it is REALLY, REALLY GOOD!!!\n\nSushi was a delight. Also super fresh and done in small batches so as to be as fresh as possible. The salmon was crazy fatty, the dragon roll was spicy ( though not spicy enough for my particular sickness ) and tasty. Everything was just a dang treat! They also keep caviar in small bowls as well as seaweed salad, seared tuna, and tons of other tasty treats. Your $16.95 dinner tab also includes crab legs, ginger lobster, salt and pepper shrimp, etc, etc.\n\nHow bout this........... GO! Seriously, have I ever steered you wrong? No, no I haven't. So go, and then thank me by showering me with gifts and praise and stuff. You won't regret it!\n\nEat well, muchacho's!\n\nV-Dub!\n\nNOTE: I just checked the website. The $16.95 price tag is a grand opening special and is in place for a limited time. The regular price for this buffet will be $20.95.  I will also note that for the quality and variety you get , it is still very reasonable. We will go again, even at that price!
0;I called and asked if they had the particular sewing machine in stock. They did. I was told they would match from Amazon's price, but not their own site. This was fine with me because Amazon's price was even cheaper. \n\nI got there to the store and as I was at the cashier, they said they would not honor the price match from Amazon. Did not seem to want to help look for alternatives, just wanted me to get out of the way of the line to help the next person. \n\nThis particular Walmart is not convenient for me to get to what-so-ever. So I went out of my way 25 minutes there, 25 minutes back, only to be disappointed. I know Amazon is their big competition, especially throughout the holiday season, and this only confirms that I should stick with Amazon. Even with the shipping, my sewing machine is still cheaper with Amazon by $80!
4;Las Palmas isn't just tacos, it's a way of life. \n\nThat being said, this place is AMAZING. $2.50 per taco?! Endless toppings?! Mexican coke in glass bottles?! Get outta town! This place has it all! By far one of my favorite places to eat...ever. The chicken tacos and the BBQ beef are my go-tos along with their salsa, pico de gallo, and endless lemons! I can't say enough good things about this place. You just need to experience it to truly believe it!\n\nJust as a sidenote, the salsa at the toppings bar aren't labeled...do yourself a favor (if you're not into spicy salsas) and avoid the deep red salsa. Unless you're SUPER into spicy (trust me, I'm a lover of spice, but I couldn't handle this salsa!), I would steer clear. I tried it once and it literally made my mouth hurt. Other than that, everything is solid and delicious! \n\nI'm constantly craving them. It's gotten so bad that I think of the amount of money I have in terms of how many tacos I can purchase at Las Palmas. So give it a go! You won't be sorry.
4;This is a great apartment community. Management is very professional and is always there to help. Maintenance has always fixed things in a timely matter. My neighbors were all very quiet. Never really saw them. So I didn't have any issues with them... Aside from their smoking. I was surrounded by smokers. My first year I did have bugs. All sorts! Roaches of course, but once they sprayed I had no problems. Lots of crickets near the end of summer. I was on the first level though. Which is probably why. My neighbor upstairs never had roaches. So, it's probably better to get a second level if you can. Not saying you won't get them, but less likely. Parking is decent. I have to say the apartment I had was in a really cute spot. Right near the pool and the walk way to my door was quaint with the pretty plants. They really make this complex clean and inviting. I only left because I wanted more storage. The one bedroom doesn't have any extra closets, unless you get the one with the loft. That wasn't enough for me, and for the price I was able to get a 2 bedroom for under 1k. I'd definitely come back here if I could afford their 2 bedroom. If you can afford it, it's worth it. It's in the perfect spot! The 215 and 95 are very close. Albertson's is nearby, Super Target down the street, Metro Pizza is right across the street, and Walgreens and Starbucks are right next door! Plus, Whole Foods and The District are very close by. My favorite places. I miss this place already!
1;Happy Hour Review:\n\nWhen we lived in the northern Chicago burbs, we had a Mia Francesca near our house. It was always a special treat to go there, because the food was very good.  \n\nRestauranteurs Scott Harris (Francesca's) and Phil Stephani (Tuscany) are two well known Chef entrepreneurs in the Windy City who competed with each other. Now Scott Harris has brought two of his Restaurants to Arizona, Mia Francesca's and Davanti Enoteca. \n\nAMBIANCE/MOOD:\nFrancesca has a very upscale feel to it (photos). A lot of dark wood with some interesting lighting. It feels almost like a men's club. The bar area has a few small two person tables, along with some fours nearer the french doors along the wall and outside. It's very relaxed. \n\nWhen we arrived around five pm and we were handed regular dinner menus. We had to later ask for the HH ones and were reluctantly given them. \n\nThe only server was the bartender Mike, who was doing double duty. It's somewhat quiet, except for the conversation of the customers. No background music, even the two HDTVs were on mute.  \n\nCLIENTELE:\nIt's a mixture of young locals who work in DC Ranch and nearby homeowners in their 40s and 50s. \n\nMENU:\nThe dinner menus were as I had remembered them. Appetizers in the the $9-12 range and entrees in the $17-28 range. The HH menu had all of it's food item for $5.00, as were the drinks\n\nSERVICE:\nAs I mentioned, the one bartender was the only server. They had three bus'ers who worked very hard at keeping the tables clean and refilling water glasses. One even tried removing my EVOO plate as I was dipping some bread in it. LOL\n\nFOOD:\nFrancesca is known for it's marinara sauce, or gravy if you prefer. It's delicious and subtle. The only standout on their HH menu is their two meatballs served in a bowl with an insane amount of basil (photo).  \n\nThe Margarita pizza was dry, with a few rough cut mozzarella slices and tiny amount of basil. You can see from the photo, the sauce had dried up, while the cheese had barely melted. The center was slightly warm and the pizza wasn't hot. \n\nWe also had the Roasted Pepper salad, with sun dried tomatoes and smoked mozzarella. The dish was overwhelmed by the vinegar of what I can only imagine was store bought jar of roasted peppers. It was unimaginative and tart. \n\nPRICES:\nThe Happy Hour prices were all $5.00. We also had two glasses of wine off the regular menu. A Hess Chardonnay for $7.50 and a Villa Antinoroi, which was a yummy blend of Sangiovese and Merlot for $9.00. Our bill total came to $34.32 including taxes, but before gratuities. \n\nIt would have been nice to have given them Three Stars for the ambiance, but the food was nothing special. We may come back to Mia Francesca for dinner, but we will avoid the HH in the future and stick to Davanti Enoteca.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/davanti-enoteca-scottsdale#hrid:eX6AD3t8C1JpE5C3cOtcjg\n\nSorry!
3;Was really impressed by this place.  High quality food was a surprise as this is a buffet.  Their steaks are made to order and were quite tasty.  These were some of my favorites but I didn't get to try everything: steak, fried shrimp, fried catfish, texas toast and mexican rice.  Their dessert bar was awesome, they had 6 different flavors of ice cream, chocolate fondue with strawberries, frozen yogurt, cookies, and pies.  The salad bar look good but didn't get a chance to try it out.  The service was phenomenal.  We didn't feel rushed and our waiter was very attentive with drinks and clearing plates.\n\nYes, the line is ridiculously long (we waited an hour) on the weekend and probably wouldn't have stayed in line if it wasn't my niece's b-day.  You're best bet is to go on a weeknight.  I've been told they take reservations on the weeknight but not on the weekend.
2;"I assume Gordon Ramsey himself reads every single one of these reviews. \nHow could he not?\nHe cares about the quality he throws his name behind, right?\nBecause if it sucks balls, then his rep as a bad ass celebrity chef is in risk. \nSo, hello Gordon, I think you're a neat fellow. \n\nI will now switch to my best British impersonation, stolen from the great Monty Python. \nThose guys were also neat. \n(Just pretend this is written in British style English, ok? Thanks.)\n\nThe quality of this fine establishment is excellent.\nI had the farm burger, with \""duck breat bacon, fried eggs, and something else.\""\nMaybe there was nothing else, just those first two things. \nRegardless, it was a good burger. \n\nBut like all things Vegas, the presentation is prettier than the substance. \nThe service was rushed and slightly rude. \nNot to me though. \nAll the girls are nice to me, because, well, who knows. \nBut the gentlemen flanking me at the bar apparently were asking too many questions and/or the waitress was having a bad day. \nI laughed at their failure to please the server. \n\nAnd also, there's the issue of price. \n$24 for a fancy burger and fries?\nThus the reason for 3 stars instead of 4. \nIf I'm paying $24 for a burger, I'm expecting the greatest burger ever made. \nAnd this ain't it. \nTasty, but not the greatest. \nAt least gimme grass fed beef, or a lap dance. \nThat last one would probably be more appropriate. \n\nGo here and wait for an hour plus, take pictures with the Gordon Ramsey photo, and embrace the typical Vegas experience."
2;I like the PT's chain. They have good beer and bar food, they cater to locals, and prices are fair. I've never really had a bad PT's experience -- but I've never had a great one, either. So let me tell you about my last trip to a PT's, the one one Trop/Maryland in the University neighborhood. \n\nI came here after the Runnin' Rebels game (Go Rebs!) as it's one of the closest bars to the Thomas and Mack. The place was cool, and there is clearly a lot of school spirit there. Our beers arrived nice and cold, and the $2 Coors deal was pretty good. My Jack and Coke was too weak for my taste, but that may be because I drink a lot. I ordered wings and fries to go along with my beer. The wings were nice and hot (temperature and spiciness) and the fries were good, too. \n\nThe reason I'm giving this place three stars instead of four or five? It's really, REALLY smokey in there. They could do a better job of clearing some of that out with some air recirculators or filters or something. Seriously, you walk out of there with the worst aroma ever. My clothes smelled like I lived inside a Marlboro carton.  Also, the weak drink really brought me down, too. Also a con, the men's room contained two urinals, a toilet, and a sink... all in a room that's about 25 square feet. You could imagine the situation...\n\nStill, this'll be a place I might re-visit eventually, but not somewhere I'd be keen on bringing others. It's not cool.
4;Dr. Hill's office is great! They are very professional and give amazing customer service. If you are looking for a dentist this is the place to go. The amazing thing is they make your crown right here in the office, while you wait. \nI saw Dr. Brady Gard and he was outstanding.
4;This dive was one of my main hangouts in the 90's. The Philly cheesesteak was the best in Vegas. I just moved back to Vegas after 12 years in Texas. I stopped by the Triple Play wondering if the food would still be as good as I remembered. \n\nI was not disappointed. The Philly cheesesteak was still as good as it was back in 1993. I'll be eating here frequently. Glad to be back in Las Vegas.
0;Back when Westgate was new and exciting, this place was a cozy cocktail lounge. Unfortunately, it was hijacked by Calico, who attempts to turn this into a nightclub with Latin flair. It fails miserably.\n\nCame here twice--once on a busy night, and once on a slow night.\n\nOn the busy night, the narrow walkway and dance floor made it pretty hard to move around. I would normally not complain about a place like this being packed, but it was just not meant to be this kind of club. It's just an uncomfortable place to be.\n\nGave it another try on a slow night, only to be greeted with my worst nightmare. They were OUT OF JAGERMEISTER. Under no circumstance should that ever happen, especially in a bar of this magnitude.\n\nNot coming here again unless I'm involved with that 'VIP special' they copied McFadden's with. By the way, EVERYONE GETS THOSE. Doesn't make them 'winners' or this place special.
0;I've been here numerous times with my pup. The first couple of cuts were great then within the last year I would bring in my Wheaton terrier and the women would only trim her, they would cut just a little bit around the ears, beard, and rear. I was also being charged $69!! After this happened the second time I called to complain but never got a call back. I just decided to take my business elsewhere.
0;Seriously, this company has the worst communication and customer service ever! I don't know if they just hire a bunch of incompetent high school drop outs or if they have zero training available, but they need to fix something! Twice now I have tried to get someone out here just to take a filter off my line from outside my apartment and that seems to be an extremely difficult task. It has taken me over a week to attemp getting cable hooked up and I still don't have it! I've been on the phone with them 6 different times and been into one of their stores even. Each time I talk to someone I am told something different... does anyone here know what the h*ll they're talking about?! I'm about to say forget it and go with a dish!\nI'm a very patient person and don't write many bad reviews, but Cox has got me very frustrated.
3;What an improvement!!\n\nI did not think the food was very good the last 2 times I went (the last time I didn't bother to update).  Tried the happy hour again to find the chicken nachos much more edible - the chicken is still a bit salty but its on the border of salty and best seasoned chicken ever.  The mushroom cap appetizer is delicious, ESPECIALLY with some lemon squeezed on top.  The wings off the bar menu were delicious as well - 3 peppers or something, so its a low lingering hot that I do enjoy.\n\nI think I will definitely come back.  Not sure for the pricier food, but the happy hour and apps are definitely much improved.
1;I am going to keep this simple. My wife and I ate dinner at the McNinch house for our 5 year anniversary. The place was so slow. The valet guy was our waiter and bus boy. (probably the chef also, but not positive) The food was ok at the best. $300 and we both left and ate pizza. Enough said?
3;"I've always taken pride in my sausage gravy, my family and friends say mine is the best they've ever had. But I have to say, Horseshoe Cafe's sets the bar. It's a  little place and the staff provides the entertainment , all you have to do is just sit back and watch, true western redneck style hospitality. The portions are perfect for the price except the biscuits and gravy, a 1/2 order is enough for 2 people and we have yet to be disappointed; in fact we ride our bikes there at least once a month just for the gravy. Yup, it's that good! And they are biker friendly."
2;"This was our first time we stayed at the Flamingo. We stayed in a \""Fab\"" room because all the upgrades to the \""Go\"" rooms were sold out. It was an average room that definately was run down. Would recommend upgrading to the Go room. \n\nWe checked in online via the email they sent, which helped us avoid the horrendously long lines. When you check in online you go to the \""keys and mail\"" line which was much shorter. Time share people at every corner, we just smiled and always said no thank you. Elevators were run down. Pool area was nice, no outside food or drink allowed in (which was annoying). The outside gardens with the flamingos and koi fish were nice. Get a rewards card upon arrival, you get a discount at all stores and restaurants at the hotel with it. \n\nOverall the location was nice, but we probably wouldn't stay here again."
0;"I went in and needed something for work for the next day. They didn't carry it and I asked the sales associate if there was anywhere nearby that might carry it, and he refused to help me out. He said,\"" I'm not at liberty to tell you another stores name.\"" we'll I'll never go there again. And I went to American shooters and found they were cheaper, had a better selection and appreciated customers."
3;Zen32 is my favorite place to get Sushi. I have been here at least a dozen times over the years and have never had an unfavorable experience. \n\nI am not the best sushi critic being that I am vegetarian, but I think they have pretty good veggie rolls and edamame :) \n\nI mostly enjoy the atmosphere and the drinks here. It's a great location, there are chicks running around in little kimono's (I think that is what they are called...), you can sit on the patio and overall the place makes me feel cool and that is really all that matters to me in life.\n\noooo I forgot about that little cucumber salad too...yumm!
2;Popped in here for a quick mani while I waited for the bf to get off work for lunch. It was a Tuesday and there were only 3 technicians working, but I was seated right away.\n\nFirst impressions --nail polish selection was lacking. They only had a few OPI and China Glaze colors, and I didn't see any colors from recent collections. Bring your own nail polish if you're looking for a specific color. The place isn't the cleanest, but I did see my tech spray off the instruments with alcohol before using them at least.\n\nAs for the mani, it was actually pretty good for $12! My technician was attentive and made sure to clean up any excess nail polish. Cuticles were trimmed well without trimming the actual skin around my nail (hate when places do that!).\n\nOverall, decent place to get a quick mani!
2;Its a great little gem, The view makes this place though. The food was great, not spectacular. The wine list was not short. In fact I was quite impressed. Always listen for the specials. I have not had a bad one yet.
4;A very nice upscale restaurant.  Bar was crowded but didn't have a problem ordering a drink and music was a little\nLoud. But it was Friday night.  Food was amazing and so was the service.
3;Very knowledgeable staff that are willing to answer any question one may have! Great selection of gear and clothing!
3;I would like to say I am a beer connoisseur, but in all honesty, I ordered wine.  But the food here was so surpirsingly good that I am still writing a review.  I ordered the crispy shrimp tacos, and they were delish!  The choices of sides were vast, I ordered the Mac & Cheese, gooey goodness! My husband got a burger w/ blue cheese crumbles, great crispy fries, (I suggested the Parm fries, but the regular ones were great)  I look forward to next time, when I will order the buffalo slop slop sloppy joes!
1;"We went to the NHRA Drag races last weekend and thought it was a good time to finally try this place. \n\nThe service was great - we were greeted promptly and our server was attentive.   However - it seemed half the food on each plate was cold.  The mash was good - but cold.  The brisket tastes fabulous but was cold.  The ribs were great and served hot, the chicken was good and served hot, the beans were good and served hot.  So in short - the food was good but it was hit or miss on temperature.  \n\nFurther - we paid just about $60.00 for lunch.  It has cloth napkins which matches the bill but it seems they want it to be a more casual place.   There were more employees than customers which caused a \""gathering\"" at the food bar in the back of the dining room.  They seemed to be having a lot of fun.  \n\nIt's certainly over priced OR they need to change it up so the food and restaurant are more in line with such high ticket items.  \n\nI'd go back - but only if someone else is buying."
1;A great place to party & have fun but not a place to get a great meal. Better off to stick to the Boat Drinks & the appetizers, at least that way you won't be disappointed. I suggest the Nachos & the Jamaican Wings. Have a couple of Margaritas and enjoy the music, the laughter and the show. Not my first trip here... nor my last. Expensive considering the quantity & the quality of the food. Recommend you pass on the Broccoli & Chicken. I've seen more meat on road kill.
3;So, it's such a great thing to live in one of the regional barbecue meccas in the good ole USA. Unless... You're not a big fan of that regions style of cue. That's the dilemna I've found myself in for the past 9 years. Just not a huge fan of the Eastern N. Carolina, whole hog, vinegar-sauced variety that this part of NC is known for. I've handled this to date by smokin my own but that's an all day deal and sometimes you just want to plop down in a booth and have someone bring you a plate of smokey goodness and a cold PBR tall boy. \n\nMidwood Smokehouse = Problem Solved! Paid my first visit with a buddy up from FL and I'm officially a happy camper. While I've only tried what the two of us ordered and shared, it's clear the thinking caps were on tight as the concept for this joint was thought through. Bring the best of some various regional cue styles to the menu, add some well-done sides and a nice bar list with plenty of drafts, bottles, bourbons, etc. and Booyah!\n\nI had the beef brisket (love the choice of lean end, fat end or both). It was hands down the best brisket I've had since my last trip to Texas. Moist and with a great smokey flavor and yummy bark. I had slaw and mac n cheese for sides and both were well executed. My buddy Mark opted for the smoked sausage with slaw and beans. Again, they took the right road by doing a sausage based on some of the best around as found in Lockhart, TX. \n\nThe service, provided this day by the cute as a button Amy, was fast and friendly.  She gladly, proudly even, brought us a sample of all 3 of the sauces to try (Vinegar-based, Mustard-based, Tomato-based).  They are all good and have their place with the variety of meats served.  Needless to say, I WILL be back.  There is so much on the menu yet to savor!
4;Cutting Image salon is one of the best salons I've been to in forever.  The atmosphere of the salon is fun and friendly and all of the stylists seem to get along great.\n\nThey made a same day appointment for me even though I wanted a cut and color which surprised me quite a bit.  Once I got there I told Sarah R. that she could have complete creative license my only requirements were that my hair be black, easy to manage, and rock.  The hair cut was exactly what I was looking for and the color turned out perfect.  Sarah took the time to get my hair just right.  I think I've found my permanent salon.
0;DONT DO IT!!! After being called on friday to tell me they cant connect my internet till they get proof of residency&4hours of my life wasted on the phone due to previous renters name still under the address  not to mention PHYSICALLY bringing in my lease -today i call to make sure the hold on my account is off... i am told no there is a hold cuz they need to see proof of residency!!!FINALLY after 3dif calls to the place (&no promised calls back) i am told my account had been canceled..&they would find out why for me. An hour later i call the general #&after talking to the manager i am told ill never be able to get a line through them because the previous tenent did not close out her account and the address will not be connected till the due balance is paid. Oh and here is the best part....i cant even pay this cynthia bitches balance cuz that account is not in my name!!!! WTF
1;Ok, I get it.  You're the hipster spot with the orange bike in the front.\n\nI get it.  Your wait staff is cooler than me, and has had the trendy style tattoos since before they trendy.\n\nBut really, the wait staff sucks.  Slow, and unprofessional, and in no way hospitable.  \n\nThe food is not bad, the prices can be a bit lower.  \n\nbut i'd fire everyone if i was the owner, and install self-service lanes like in Fresh & Easy.\n\nI'd rather have a robot  greet me than a angsty 20something with an attitude.
2;Ice cream here is nothing special.  They make the ice cream with 1/2 gelato and 1/2 ice cream. Overpriced in my opinion. Decor is lacking.
0;I totally called it! This place is CLOSED!
3;they have good service here. sale people here are good! they let you kno when the sales are comming and show u whats new via email!\n\nsmall selection in the store but they will get you whatever you want if u order!
0;Very dirty and disgusting. Sat down and he brought out egg noodles and duck sauce. Long black hair right on top. Got up and walked out.
4;The thing I love most about Costco is that I really trust the quality of the products they offer. It seems like they really do their research before stocking a product. On the rare occasion that you buy a dud, they'll take it back with no hassle.
3;Great stadium, weak fan backing like every other losing team, but good food/beverage options and every seat has a good view.
3;Let's talk about the space first. Gorgeous! They really know how to design a hip and trendy joint. Exposed beams, hanging industrial lights and shelves of spices. Very cool. Definitely very similar to their sister restaurant, Local, but better.\n\nWe came in on a snowy Sunday, so it wasn't very busy. I note that because we waited quite a bit for the cheese plate we ordered first. That was a bit confusing because you wouldn't think a cheese plate would take long to bring out. \n\nThankfully we didn't wait long for our bloody mary and mimosa, so at least there's that. The bloody mary was perfect. Spicy, made with pepper vodka. So once the cheese plate came out we dove in. I have to say I was a bit disappointed. One, because our server just dropped it off and didn't explain what cheeses were on the board. So we had no clue what we were eating. Two because the cheese selections seemed sub-par. Since I'm not sure what cheeses they were it's hard to say where they came from or what exactly they were. I will note that the biscotti on the plate was very good though!\n\nSo for the main course I ordered one of my favorite brunch items, eggs benedict. I thought they were very good. The only thing I'd change is the english muffin. It was very thin and I would have liked one that gave a better base to all the other goodness on top. But I thought the bacon, eggs and hollondaise sauce was excellent. But, again, another issue one could find is that it was a small portion. It was enough for me because I wasn't starving, and we had the cheese plate, but I did think it was small. \n\nTo sum it up, it was up and down. Our server was friendly enough, other than the misstep with the cheese plate (obviously not a huge deal). I would absolutely come back and hope they just keep trying to improve on things to make it a better place!
4;This place is like I designed it as my own restaurant.  Cool beachy theme. The sweetest servers in Scottsdale. Not just one server helps you they all make sure you get good service.  The food is cool too.  Burgers with hatch peppers my personal favorite.  And then sweet potato tatortots.  Who ever thought of something so cool.  And too top it off home made fresh pretzel rolls for your burger.  Now all I need is a banana shake.  Which they probably have with rum. I just didn't ask. They have dietcoke which is hard to find is most phoenix restaurants so I just had one of those. Which I think they filled twenty times.
3;This is a nice hotel to check out as they have area designed as if you were walking on the streets of NY and they have dining options on that street from quick bites to upscale restaurant depending on what you want to pay and eat.\n\nI went to eat their on my first night and tried The original Fulton Fish Frye... it was quite good and easy on the pocket. Plus the experience to be sitting on the streets on NY and eating Fish and Chips was quite good.
3;"I want this restaurant to thrive. They cater to vegans and offer some great selections (not to be confused with all healthy options, mind you!). I've been here twice now. My lunch included their version of a Big Mac, which was delicious. Again, not healthy, but my side of veggies with hardly any noticeable oil or \""butter\"" was most definitely healthy. I splurged on their chocolate/caramel dessert. It was good but pricey.\n\nMy second visit on a Friday night with my husband, resulted in really good food again. His salad was loaded with fruits and veggies and came with an awesome dressing. My jackfruit tacos were a nice surprise and now I'm looking to try jackfruit at home too. We shared a ginger cookie, whipped cream dessert, which was a good ending to our meal.\n\nThe drawbacks are hard to overlook... the location is completely out of place and is only accessible going into town on the crazy Highway 74. The restaurant itself is so plain inside & out. So plain it's a bit of a turnoff to those who might not be drawn in by their specific food offerings.\n\nI understand they recently got their liquor license, but I'll be surprised if that drastically increases traffic. They were noticeably uncrowded on a Friday night, pre-alcohol sales. The location & interior isn't a place I'd go out of my way to get a drink at. I'm simply there for the food.\n\nMove this concept (and chefs!) to a more central, appealing, convenient location and I think they would be far more successful. I, for one, would be ready & willing to dine here more often to support this local business."
4;Came in here with some friends while our cars were getting washed across the street. The owner actually let us pick our own beers out of the cooler. It was my Birthday and I found an awesome beer called Birthday Suit lol. And I splurged on a Game of Thrones Beer. He was happy to explain what was an IPA or an Amber or whatever. But it's just fun to see and drink exotic beers whatever they are haha! Really good time. Support cool local businesses.
2;My review is closer to a 3 1/2.,\nit's above A-OK but below Yay! I'm a fan\n\nThis is one of these restaurants that is a darling of the food literati in this town, I believe that it happens with ethnic restaurants when the chef can speak English or French with ease and when it's upscale enough that food snobs don't feel that they're eating somewhere beneath them. \n\nIt loses points for it's location (I know it's close for some, but not for all). \nIt also loses points for the waiter yelling at me from across the room not to sit at a particular table. \n\nThe food is very good, but the portions are small and the price are a bit too high.\n\nWe had the 5 Mezze platter ($30) which includes  2 small dolma, 2 bulgur kibbe, a small side of calamari and 2 different garlicky yogurt. \n\nFor mains, we had the Su Kebab ($26), which was very tasty, but does not come with a side dish, it's cut up and draped on a thin loaf of bread, accompanied by a drizzle of sauces.\n\nWe also had the aphrodisiac chicken dish ($23), a small quarter chicken, nicely done with rice and dried fruit.\n\nWe had to fill out on bread just to feel a bit full.\n\nThe desserts are in the $10 range, very overpriced as the portions are tiny.\n\nWith 2 drinks, the total came to $140 before tip, so this is definitely on the pricey side.\n\nAuthentic Turkish does not have to be expensive, the decor is modern Mediterranean, but minimalist. I would only bring somebody who does not want to slum it a the low key kebab places.\n\n\n\n.
1;"U should call this place Robertos. and that would be an insult to mr. roberto himself. i had the fish tacos of course and wow were they plain. just think of middle school lunch fish in a bland torilla. flavorless. u would think with a name \""wahoo's fish tacos\"" their tacos would be good. this is really a bar. the bar is good and it has gaming so go here to drink and gamble not eat."
3;Good Networking Party tonight at Buster's.
3;I was in town for my daughters graduation and stayed here. The place is newly renovated, very clean and the staff was very nice. The breakfast was okay. The price was fair. I would defiantly stay here again
1;My coworker and I were searching for ugly Christmas sweaters for a funny Christmas card photo. Savers and Goodwill were fabulous, but this store was a huge disappointment. It was dirty, smelled terrible and the clothes were by far the nastiest I've seen at a thrift store. Shirts had pee stains on them for crying out loud. Just EW. 2 stars because the pee stained shirt we bought was only $.75. You get what you pay for I guess. Goodwill down the road on Sahara is inifintely better people! No weird smells, better mechandise and much larger.
4;Our company has been coming here for many years to host our meetings and Christmas party.  This hotel has a great set-up for large events and lots of guest accommodations.  Centrally located in downtown Pittsburgh, there are lots of shopping and places to eat.  Its an ideal location.
0;This place was awful, just awful. \n\n1) Value is horrible. The prices look good but the pizza sizes are actually VERY small. A large at sano is maybe a medium at normal pizza shops at best. I usually get 2 larges for my family, 2 larges from sano did not feed everyone like usual.\n\n2) They are very skimpy on toppings (we got meat lover pizza). \n3) Very little sauce on the thin thin crust. \n4) Taste was average. \n\nOverall my whole family was very disappointed. We had to go somewhere else because our order was way too small. pizza wasn't even good. will not be returning. EVER. \n\nI can see someone eating here if they were eating alone. the sizes are just so tiny which makes it seem like a great value.
2;I have been going to Dolce for years and I am a fan of the salon for the most part. If it weren't for my hair stylist (Ambre) I'm not sure I would go as often as I do. It's a full service salon that offers everything from spray tan to Brazilian Blowouts. \n\nIf you want to book an appointment I recommend you try to book online. If you call to book over the phone set aside at least 10 min because thats how long it takes to get someone on the phone:(
0;I came here about a month ago & it was my very first clubbing experience ever!  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  The only good thing was that we got in for free.  The music was whatever.  It was ridiculously packed, like shoulder to shoulder & feeling random people's sweaty arms rub against you! YUCK!  There were a ton of stairs & hardly any walking space.  The atmosphere & everything made me feel suffocated.  I will definitely never go back here.  I also hear that the bouncers, although friendly, are lenient & let in people with fake IDs (because I know of people who go here with them & look nothing like the people in the IDs!), which probably adds to the overcapacity!  If you want to have fun & be able to breathe, go to XS.
2;Have eaten here a few times before & was very satisfied...UNTIL THIS VISIT service a little slow had to wait 30 mins. for our burgers which tasted OK but were very much on the small side..we ordered the relapse which is smaller size offered but both of them were about the size patty you would get from Micky Dees so for $9 All I got was a $3 burger. I may have to rethink this visit before we go back again. Because we really like the place. Great people but not burgers on this visit.
0;I will stick my weiner in a meat grinder before I ever eat here again.  The chicken (if it was indeed chicken) was chewy, the store itself was dirty (dead bugs in areas where they couldn't easily sweep).  If my posts end after this......you will know it was from dirty food
2;"The menu is very limited; all the food here comes in one color: #cc7722 aka ochre. The chicken strips and crinkle fries are a little better here than at other fast food joints. Psst, the rumor is the secret dipping sauce is a mixture of ketchup, mayo, Worcestershire and spices ... shhh!"
4;I am just reviewing some of my. . well, reviews. . .and wanted to say this place is still my fav Las Vegas Chinese food.  It is just delicious and my mom and I still go there,  split the orange chicken and enjoy every bite.  Perfect amount for the two of us even though we often feel compelled to order more.
1;"My boyfriend and I were excited to visit Hubert Keller's Burger Bar in the Mandalay Place after Keller's appearance on Top Chef Masters. \n\nMy boyfriend customized a Natural Burger(?) with Swiss cheese and portabella mushroom on a wheat bun with a side of onion rings, while I customized my Kobe Burger with mozzarella, caramelized onions, and garlic aioli on a sesame bun, and I got mine with a side of sweet potato fries.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong. These were good burgers. But there was nothing more to it. They were good, but not exceptional. We were expecting in-your-face goodness but the burgers certainly failed to meet that expectation, considering the chef's reputation. Quite honestly, Umami in LA has better burgers; the patties are incredibly juicy at Umami. For what the Burger Bar is charging, i.e. anywhere from $10 ~ $16 for a burger that comes with fries, or $16~$21 customized burger and sides, they need to do better than what they are serving now. \n\nThe only things that were memorable were the garlic aioli and the onion rings; other than that, I would consider this place as \""been there, done that\"" and something that I have checked off my list, but do not expect to visit again."
2;"While the decor is unique & fun, and the names of the dishes are playful & young, overall it wasn't someplace where I left saying \""wow, I want to go back again!!\"""
0;If I could give this show a rating of zero I would. As I write this review the performance that I attended is still being held. I received a ticket to this show as a comp. Although I didn't pay any money for this show,  I felt as if I was owed a refund. After 40 minutes I just got up and walked out because it was just horrible. I have seen better performances by street performers on the strip.
3;"For me this place has now won my lunch business over Ichiza! They have the entire menu available for lunch (Ichiza only has a small menu of 15 or so items), and honestly it's bigger and to me had a better atmopshere. Additionally the service was WAY better.. no comparison. I have yet to try this place for dinner.\n\nWe tried the pork ramen, fried rice, gyoza, and a rice ball. All were excellent and prices were on par if not a little cheaper than Ichiza. The \""burnt\"" rice ball was the highlight, the gyoza filling was probably the biggest let down (not much flavor). I loved the picture menu and I look forward to trying more."
4;I went to Sushi Eye for lunch on a Friday. The place was packed, the waitresses looked a little stressed and some of the clientele was a little crabby because they had to wait a little longer for their food. Honestly, I've waited longer at sushi restaurants for sushi that wasn't worth it. I found the pieces at Sushi Eye to be pleasantly large, the rolls were delicious and well made and the service was very friendly. We tried the Booty Booty Roll, the Salmon Skin Roll and a few pieces of Sake (salmon) and Unagi. My only complaint was that we didn't have individual plates, so eating the end pieces of the Booty Booty roll was a little challenging because there was no way either one of us, even with mouths as large as we have, could fit the entire piece with the shrimp tails sticking out, in one shot...so we ended up with a lot of rice in our soysauce dishes. But, it was a fun adventure anyway. Oh, and the Nigiri...the pieces of salmon were twice as long as most other places. Compared with the other sushi places I've been to in AZ (all two of them), the prices at Sushi Eye were the most reasonable. The regular rolls average around $6 or $7 while the special rolls (like the Booty Booty) average around $9 to $14. The Nigiri pieces were around $4 or $5.\n\nOne thing that did confuse me a little at first, and I'm not trying to be picky here, I just want to help out people who have never been there before: the rolls are all listed in the front section of the menu while the pieces are listed in the back section, so you kind of have to look for them. This is important because somebody actually comes and takes your order rather than you filling out a slip of paper writing in how many of each item you want. If you go to their website, sushieye.com, you can see a full color menu there. It's worth checking out before you go.\n\nOh, and they have a new location opening in Chandler in November.
0;"Oh Casey Jones, how you have failed me. I remember when I first came across you, free UFC, decent bar food, which included delicious fried cheese curds and jalapeno bottle caps. You even had decent beer prices! Terrible selection, but the price point was fine. \n\nRecently though, things have changed. I'm guessing an ownership change. \n\nNew menu, which is ugly by the way. If you're not going to hold onto any of the train motifs in the menu, then why keep the thing on the ceiling? \n\nCompletely new and inept staff with glassy eyes, who don't seem to care at all. When I ask for tea, don't bring me Diet Pepsi with a lemon in it.\n\nAnnoying announcements 5 times in one night (yes, we know you're offering $4 Yager crap drinks, please stop reminding me, and no, having a child yell \""get some\"" isn't cute. It's probably illegal.)\n\nUnderstaffing the bar when there is a fight, so your servers are overworked and stressed, leading to problems & unhappy customers.\n\nServing cold food and pizza that tastes like dishwater. \n\nI can't find one thing I like about you anymore.  I'm going elsewhere."
3;Enormous! Compared to the Chapparal Dog Park, this one is like a whole canine planation with dogs running around for acres on end. Ok maybe not that big, but really large with lots to sniff. Which is really what you care about when you have an ADD bloodhound with a hyperactive nose. The people there are usually really cool and you might even feel like a parent at a kid park socializing with the other mommies while they prance around and chase or hump each other. It's nice to have a human to chat with while your pup runs around.\n\nThere are a couple of strange peeps (more than avid dog lovers) here along you may run into the self-appointed dog-park police who will not hesitate to tell you to pick up your dog's crap or let you know that your dog is not playing nice, but pay no attention. There is no actual dog park po-po. On the whole, this a great place to let 'em loose for a while and wear them out.
3;"Avizandum apparently means something like \""takes time to consider his judgement\"", e.g. \""It did not take avizandum to write this review\"".\n\nThis law specialist book shop, right in the centre of town and not far from George Sq. Campus, has the largest collection of Scots law books in the country and has a pretty big range of law books in general. It's the only law specialist book shop in Edinburgh and if you study the subject at the local uni, expect to pay a visit here.\n\nMost university textbooks are expensive, but law books are REALLY expensive, so be prepared to part with your cash. This isn't anything particularly unique to Avizandum though and you'd pay just as much in Blackwells. Unfortunately the only way around this is really to shop around on the internet. \n\nIf you don't know exactly what you're looking for, or you do and can't find it, the staff at Avizandum are quite happy to help you out. If for any reason they don't have something you need, they can order it in."
0;We went here for lunch since it was recommended by a friend who frequents Las Vegas. The place is small and not a good place for a large party. Service was HORRIBLE! The waitress didnt greet us when we walked it then after waiting 10 minutes after we sat down, she came up to us and asked us if we were ready to order.... SERIOUSLY?! We didnt even have a menu yet. GEEZ. The food was okay. my husband and I had the Kalua pig and Katsu combo and we regret it. The Kalua pig was way to salty and dry. My stepmom had the adobo and the pork was really dry too. I will not return here again, I'd rather got to L&L.
3;Recently started ordering take out from china inn, and so far my husband and i have been pleasantly surprised. Delivery time is prompt and food is good for take out. Shrimp egg rolls are delicious, have also tried the sesame chicken and house combination chow mein both really good.  Best chinese take out in our neighborhood.
3;I like Fresh& Easy a lot. Even though it doesn't have everything, it has a lot of items that are quality at a great price....I come here first and then what I can't find I go to another grocer for. \n\nJust wanted to add that this one has really nice staff who say hello when you past by and help you check out even though it's self checkout. It's pleasant to see more cheerful staff at stores...other grocers seem to hate their life.
4;This is it!  Michael Jackson isn't the only one.  This place is so great...every aspect of it.  What carne asada fries are to drunks in San Diego and what Paisano's Pizza is to drunks in Hermosa Beach, Grand Lux is to drunks in Vegas.  \n\nThe beauty of this place though is that it is for classy drunks and not even for only drunks.  The food: perfection.  They have THE BEST Chicken Parm I've ever had. They use a number of different types of cheeses that add to the tastyness of it.  They also lighly bread the chicken making it more tasty.  Unlike other places where all you taste is fried batter.  You get the flakeyness and deliciousness of the breading here with the juicyness of the chicken.  Now let's move on to the next entree...shall we?\n\nIf you order Buffalo ______ at Grand Lux, it's a safe bet to be amazing.  Anything Buffalo is good here. Their buffalo chicken roll appetizers are some of the best appetizers I've ever had and their spicy buffalo chix sandwich just adds to the buffalo goodness.  Sometimes I order both and I may get a look from the waiter recognizing my buffalo filled meal, but all that subsides after the first bite.  Now to breakfast...\n\nI tried their breakfast buffet here for the first time 2 weeks ago, and it was $15.95 and it included juice.  Very good breakfast selection of eggs, bacon, omelette station, fruit, waffles, etc.  The only thing missing was pancakes.  What i did though was made a nice dessert out of the waffles by taking some hot waffles and adding some of the chocolate chips they have laying around and put a nice dose of whip cream on top.  And if I'm feeling good, add some fruit.  They also have hash browns, which were some of the BEST hash browns I've ever had.  They weren't dry at all.  It was just great.\n\nThe greatest part is that they have 6 cheesecake factory cheesecakes (b/c it is the same company) and a whole bunch of other awesome desserts that I am sadly usually too full to eat.  I can't recommend this place more!
2;I'm assuming this is the Hard Rock at Mandalay. I went for Breakfast one am. First off, they aren't open for breakfast until 8am, which I thought was more than strange considering the crazy hours one makes while in Vegas. I had jet lag during the trip and was eating breakfast at 630am and 730am and heck sometimes my friends weren't getting in til 9am! \n\nAnyway, I digress... I ordered the standard 2 egg breakfast. It was massive. 2 people could easily split it. My only issue is that it was crazy greasy...even for this southern girl. Maybe they make it that way for all the drunks who need the grease to soak up the alcohol but it just made me feel sick. They were nice enough to sub out the bread for fruit and there was a lot of it. Service was a bit slow also. Otherwise, great value for the money.
1;Thought the desserts were just OK, but not for the price we paid.  We were looking forward to this after the Celine Dion concert, and the desserts were actually quite disappointing.\n\nWe ordered the chocolate pizza and the s'mores.  The chocolate pizza just didn't taste very good to us, and the s'mores were tiny.\n\nThere are definitely other places in LV that we'd go to for dessert before we try Max Brenner's again.
0;Carlos is the worst server there.  \n\n\n\nI was sat got my drink and then waited 10 mins for the Guac that I wanted.  Mean while a table gets sat next to us and the place wasn't busy like it has been last time I went there.   The other table gets drink and their order taken before he even thinks about taking ours then walks away.  No water in our glasses I am out of my beverage from the bar I have to wave him down and get him to come over to me I ask for the bill because I am tired of dealing with idiots and then all of a sudden he wants to be the best waiter in the restaurant.   I told him not to bother his manager because I didn't want to waste his time.  There is nothing that the manager could have done even if he spoke with me to please me after this visit here.   Yet to remind you that I live 24 miles away from the restaurant in North North Las Vegas.  Needless to say I will no longer go back to visit this restaurant.\n\n\n\nThis is the first time that I got so mad that I left a restaurant.  I am a chef and I know that sometimes people are busy but when half the restaurant is full that is not busy.  It just means that you knew someone to get the job and trust me the only break this guy got was when they hired him.
1;Nothing bad to be said about the product, it's Dole Whip. It's deliciousness in a cup. 2 stars for the lack of service. I have visited twice so far and both times the service was non existent. I understand it's in the food court inside the mall but c'mon, service should be somewhat pleasant no matter the location. I believe each customer should be asked if it's their first time, especially if you've been studying the menu for a couple of minutes looking perplexed. And if it is, engage them and try to sell your product. Have them try what you offer. Believe me, if I had my mind set on getting a small, but if I get A+ service 99 percent of the time I always upgrade, and I think most people will agree with me on this. Unfortunately for me, both times (12/20 & 12/23) both the guy and young girl manning the register just stood there and waited for us to order, not even a casual hello or an effort to upsell for that matter.
4;Awesome donut joint.  It has an old school feel to it. We saw it on the way to an errand we were running and decided to double back and get a few donuts.  They have 2 employees there and they are super friendly.  If you check in here you get a free donut code.  My phone died right after I showed it to her and snapped a few photos but the lady there still gave me the free donut.  It seems that this restaurant has been here for awhile.  It has a well worn out look to it but the donuts are crazy delicious.  They have this donut called an Alaskan donut that is about as big as your head.  I opted for the much smaller donuts...An apple critter...Chocolate on Chocolate, and a Blueberry Fritter. Check it out if your on that side of town.
0;"My husband and I came here almost anytime we wanted to do date night for dinner and a movie. However, I don't think we will be coming back after such an awful experience tonight. \nWe went to see the Hobbit at 9:45 pm. I arrived at our seats around 9:25-9:30 and wait. Normally I never had an issue with service and always got my drinks quickly. \nThat's why when my husband came from the restroom he was surprised that no one came to me. \nWe waited and the movie already started when we asked 2 different servers if we can put our order in or get our server. One of them had the audacity to say \""I'm not your server\""... Ok can you get us our server? \nI worked on the restaurant business so I know how you should act and that's definitely not the way to be in the hospitality industry. \nIt was about 10:10 when our server finally came to us to get our drinks and order. \nI ordered grilled cheese and tomato bisque and my husband ordered Angus Trio Sliders with sweet potato fries and with brownie ice cream for desert. Food was ok nothing special but was very disappointed when we never received them.. We got our plates taken away from someone other than \nour server and our server came about 15 minutes after that.. Keep in mind the movie is going and our server comes to check up on us and I told him we never got the fries and to make sure it's not on our bill. He never apologized he just said it won't be and left. \nHe came back after 20 minutes and asked me if we ordered dessert. I told him we orders the brownie ice cream from him.. Then he seemed confused. He asked me if we received the dessert I said no we ordered it but didn't not get. \""Oh so you are it\"" I was so shocked how dumb this server was I almost yelled loudly but the movie was still playing.. I quietly said again, we ordered the brownie, have not received it and have not eaten it.. \""Oh so you didn't order dessert.\"" ............ *sigh* \""sir we ordered the brownie ice cream but only got our entree that were missing our fries\"" \nAfter about 5 minutes of going back and forth, he left and we got our dessert about 10 minutes after that.. Overall we got our dessert at 11:45.. \nThe most disappointing part was that no one came to talk to us at the end or that they didn't try to do anything for is.. It's not that we wanted a free dinner or anything we just wanted to see the gesture.. \nWhat a disappointment."
2;"This place would earn a higher rating from me if they took a little care in making the sandwiches. The ingredients are of high quality, but are used inconsistently and carelessly when the sandwich is made. It is not as if I am surprised, as they are assembled by young lads and lasses who are probably making something akin to minimum wage. Speaking of which, I find it a tad odd that these youthful people call their tips \""beer money.\"" Do they take the tips and wait outside a gas station, trying to convince patrons to buy them a twelver? Maybe they should call the tips \""candy money\"" or whatever it is American youngins buy today. Old man rants aside, the sandwiches here are very good, and it is a great fast food option."
3;I got a complimentary haircut and style through a fundraiser for Ralf's. and I had never been to there before so I didn't know what to expect. It was a great atmosphere and relaxing. Randi was my stylist- she is very nice and I love my hair cut! The only thing that I was not a fan of was the front desk checkout lady- she was SO loud! While waiting for Randi, I heard everyone's checkout prices along with how much they are tipping... and I was sitting at the opposite end of the waiting area- I thought that was rude. Randi rocks though!
2;"This place is definitely a dive but I can't say its not delicious. The wings aren't as scrawny as most places I go to;they are actually good meaty wings.The hot garlic is probably my favorite sauce because I can't get it anywhere else. The fried zucchini is also awesome. Service and food is great but the atmosphere could use some work."
0;"This is based on my last trip to the store. I was sent to the store from cosmoprof to pickup the igora metallic. The associate was not helpful at all, she was actually insulting. After I asked what developer was needed for the metallics because I did not want to have to make a second trip and it was also a new product to me and I like to be certain. she rudely replied with \""do you even do hair?\"" First off Paula, why else would I be on your store, secondly how else could I complete my purchases and lastly how else would I know your other associates? So now I would like to ask you Paula, \""do you even retail?\"" Because I get better customer service at the gas station and your product knowledge is inadequate."
0;I have been several times and nope it sucks. Back to Panda. The meat taste strange, I mean real strange. The Mongolian no matter how much Soy Sauce a molecule can take its still bland. At least at YC's or even Genghis Grill you have options. You will find that there are several dishes that are decent and its all chicken...I hope...
0;What a joke. I've had my oil changed for years at other big o locations and have always brought my own oil. Now they are making me buy it from them. Do not go here. Awful customer service.
2;We have been here a few times and the food and service are usually very good.  Can get crowded on weekends but worth waiting a bit to get a table.  The noise level is not too loud like some other places.  Didn't care for their specialty drinks but the beers are good and they have a nice selection.
4;I found Big Jimmy's on grubhub & decided to give them a try. I got a pizza with 3 veggie toppings.  The crust was amazing & the pizza was delicious.  I also ordered a philly cheesesteak sub with extra toppings. The bread was very fresh & delicious.  The steak had a peppery taste, which I liked a lot.  I don't usually get excited by tomatoes, but these were fresh and sweet.  I would definitely order from here again.  Great value.
0;Hmm...This was a last nite in Vegas and wanted a fancy dinner.    Looking back this was a pretty heavy meal, we should have not done it the last nite.   We were celebrating friend's bachelorette party and we got the package that includes entrance to Tao afterward.      It was pre determined menu and personalized which I thought was a great touch.   Was really looking forward to the last nite and just talking with the girlfriends.    We arrive and seated promptly.    Get to table and no thinking and our appetizers come.   It would have been nice to get our drink orders in at least.   So we are chit chatting talking barely made a dent in out apps and then our salads come out.      So now our tables is covered in food and its coming to fast.    \n\nI call over waiter and ask him to give us some time in between courses.   We received the apps and salads in matter for 10 minutes.      As we are talking another party comes but at our tables.     They are obviously drinking and making a distracting scene.     Yes I know it is Vegas and every one drinks.   But that doesn't mean you act ignorant.     However our dinner comes 10 minutes later and we still haven't finished our apps or salads so food is on table getting cold.     In the meantime, other table is getting louder and louder.    I ask the waiter to ask them to bring it down  a bit.     He then proceeds to tell me the table is friends with the owner.    And I said I understand I just want the to turn it back a little.     Not less than 1 minute later, the waiter goes to the table and tells them I wanted them to be quiet.    \n\nThe other tables then starts to act ignorant (Dear Owner, I hope you talk to  your friends, it is bad reflection of the ownership)    We ignore them but livid with waiter on how he handles situation.    I ask the waiter to bring manager. The manager does not show up for 15 minutes.    Come to find out the waiter, tells manager that we started an altercation with other table.   I then grow livid.    We just finished our meal and left...Such a disappointment.
4;We went in after seeing a menu online for a 3 course meal for $28, however the online menu must have been for summer as the selection was more winter fare when we got there.  We were disappointed some of the items we were looking forward to weren't there but chose the Salmon and Petite filet along with our sides being a Caesar salad and BBQ ribs.\nSadly, they were out of salmon so my boyfriend went off of the 3 course meal and ordered the lamb shank instead - but we still got our BBQ ribs for the appetizer as it came out before we could tell the waitress he went off the menu.\nThe petite filet was as good (if not better) than some places on the strip I have had, and my boyfriend (who doesn't eat much lamb) was a huge fan of the meat-falling-off-the-bone tender lamb shank.  Since I stayed on the 3 course meal I got a Creme Brulee for dessert which was big enough for two.  \nI wish my petite filet (only 6oz) would have had more on the plate than just a smattering of mashed potatoes under the filet that was maybe 3oz - some carrots would have been nice, or anything - my plate just looked so bare with a tiny (albeit delicious)  steak and nothing else. \n\nThe waitress was as nice as could be and gave us a special card to get points with each purchase and get special coupons sent to our email every so often.  So with that, we should be going back again!
0;I was attending an event last weekend and wanted my hair to look great, better than I can do it myself.  She asked me what I wanted and I asked for a sleek blow dry.  She ended up teasing my hair and put SO MUCH hairspray in it, I couldn't get my fingers through it.  How is that sleek? Big and teased is the opposite of sleek.  I said it was a little big and stiff and she said to run my hands through it to loosen it up.  What?  I was in and out in 20 minutes with terrible hair for $35 dollars.  I could have asked for her to fix it, but since she didn't understand what sleek meant, I figured I was better off using my time to fix it on my own.   I went home and had no choice but to wash it and start over. \n\nI will never be back.
0;"Take this review very seriously, I am not trying to be rude or funny, or even a prisoner of the moment...I promise.\n\nFor a good 7 seven years I  have held the belief that Buca di Beppo was the worst restaurant in the area, flavorless and decrepit! But there is a new sheriff in town, and his name is Someburros, and he is more evil than Arpiao. \n\nWith food worse than what is probably served in tent city, I am now reeling in horror at what may come tomorrow or even within the hour. You see, the \""meats\"" in both my and my gf's burros have got to be canned or canner quality, you know...Friskas. Seriously. The nachos were nothing but old, whole corn tortillas shingled with tepid beans, cold cheddar cheese, and a good 8 oz of jalepenos! Speechless...\n\nI'm sorry, but if you check in here, check yelp for a \""nearby\"" urgent care center."
4;I have been coming here for close to two years now and have never had a problem. \n\nI usually go Tuesdays for the traditional wing specials because boneless wings don't have a soul.\n\nGreat bartenders and servers on swing shift and a great place to catch a game. The bartenders are more than willing to accommodate the crowd on what gets shown on the screens, and don't mind when I start frothing at the mouth every time a Laker player turns the ball over.\n\nThe food is excellent, I always order a dozen hot and a basket of wedges (the wedges are some of the best I've tried anywhere). I can't testify to their other flavors because I'm a wing-purist and believes they should only be eaten hot.
2;"I recently made an appointment with Chandler Modern Dentistry for the $39.00 cleaning, xray and evaluation special. My most recent dentist has retired  and I decided to look on my own for a new dentist rather than rely on referrals.\nFirst I was impressed with the physical layout of the office.  I was taken to an xray room where I was treated to a display of xrays and pictures of my mouth. This was excellent.\n\nNext I was taken to an examination room where a technician evaluated my gum health.  Following this exam a front office person came in and presented me with the options for cleaning my teeth.  The options went up to $190.00.\nLuckily I had a \""lifeline\"" and called my recently retired dentist friend who told me that I should stay with the basic cleaning.\n\nThe dental technician did a quick and painless cleaning.\nThe dentist then showed me a problem with my teeth which needed correction. I agreed and the front office person came in and presented me with the proposed actions and the proposed charges for the actions.\n\nI was given a set of pictures and the proposed bill.\n\nUpon presenting my credit card to pay the bill I was given a bill for $95.00.  \n\nI mentioned that I was there for the \""intro special.\""  I was told that I had an \""expanded cleaning.\"" I had turned down some of the cleaning options but obviously not all of them.\n\nRather than argue I have paid the bill. First because I don't have time to attempt to argue a possible \""bait and switch\"" situation.  I explained to the front office person that the $3900.00 proposed charges for a dental implant did not bother me near as much as a up sell from $39.00 to $95.00.\n\nI mentioned the ad and was told that I needed to \""read the small print.\"" That comment settled my opinion of Chandler Modern Dentistry.  I don't have time to read the \""small print.\"" Additionally  what if there is \""small print\"" associated with the proposed dental implant. Let the buyer beware.\n\nI have gone to another dentist whose price for the dental implant is basically the same. I asked if there is any\""small print' that I should be concerned about and was told \""no.\"" Since this is a referral I will trust the comment.\n\nThe bottom line is - Chandler Modern Dentistry is doing the best they know how to do.  I recommend that if you are considering using their services, however, that you read the small print, if any."
3;The short ribs and \npork belly bites are fantastic!  Great atmosphere and good service!
0;Doesn't compare to America. Go on, give me some hate.
1;I had a teriyaki chicken bowl with broccoli. The chicken was kind of burnt. The broccoli was good. The rice was decent. The teriyaki sauce was too sweet. Nice people though!
3;Love those apple rolls!  Atmosphere reminds me of an old school donut shop.  Would go there again.  Simplistic recipes, pure in taste.
0;"I read about District in Phoenix magazine and looked forward to it all week. I live in N. Scottsdale and rarely get to downtown Phoenix.\n\nGot there about 5:30 last Saturday so they weren't busy. The hostess first sat us at one of the horrible small two person tables but we had to move over one table because there was some syrupy food on the bench. I told the waitress when she eventually got to us and she said she would get it taken care of but it sat there the entire time we were there.\n\nWe had to request a wine list!!!!! HI!!! Isn't \""Wine Bar\"" in the name of the joint? Seriously, it just went downhill after walking in the door. It took about ten minutes to actually get a bottle of wine once ordered. Then the busboy brought some freshly chilled dinner rolls. Why bother wrapping them in a napkin and putting them in a pretty bowl? To keep the cold in?? The calamari was actually good, the two sauces they brought to go with it were blah at best.\n\nEntrees. Scallops still frozen in the middle! Crab cakes were barely above room temperature. Too bad, they could have been something. The best thing: french fries. It took at least ten minutes for the scallops to come back, what the hell? Scallops shouldn't even be cooked for ten minutes.\n\nWill never return unless there's a giant \""Under New Management\"" banner hanging out front!!"
2;This was my second time eating breakfast here.  It didn't seem as good as last time, the crust on the quiche was a little over done.  That said, the brioche cinnamon roll was great, best I've had in a while.  Also, the potatoes are much better with onions and mushrooms added.  The pricing seems a little high compared to most breakfast places around here.  Still, a solid choice overall.
1;Delicious.... BUT 45 mins for a cheeseburger is no bueno for a half full restaurant!!\n\nServer was super nice and apologetic but almost walked out. \n\nOne more thing, the band tonight is TERRIBLE! You'd think the standards would be much higher at hard rock!
4;Good BBH, Great spring rolls, delicious ice coffee, Excellent service. :) Will come back again!
4;During Resturant Week July 18 to 26.  I went ot the Bistro La Bon and was plesantly surprised at the quality of the food and the selections.  I started with he Roasted beet and watermelon salad it was one of the best salads I have ever experienced.  I have traveled the throughout the USA only selecting the best and I found it here.  The Wild Caught Alaskan Salmon was seared to perfection.  The flourless chocolate truffle cake was light as a feather and to compliement the dish the fresh Mango Sorbet was divine! I will definately return at every Charlotte, NC visit.  If you live in the area you must go to Bistro La Bon.  If I lived here It would be my weekly resturant.  Bon Appetit!\n\nEdith P.
3;How wonderful and delightful my lunch be! I had Asian Chicken grilled salad.  Fun place for kids. The have a nice play area.
4;I've been travelling to Phoenix for the past 5 years.  Szechwan Palace is always on my list of restaurants to hit up during my stay.  I have often been the only Caucasian customer in the restaurant during a visit.  To me, this is a mark of a good Chinese joint.  This is not your run of the mill average Americanized Chinese food. \n\nYou can order from the American-Chinese menu or from the more authentic Chinese menu.  I've had items from both and all were great.  My favorite combination is the General Tso's (best I've ever had) and the steamed spicy pork dumplings.  \n\nGo there.  If you have a couple of extra minutes, drop in Super L Ranch Market, too.  They have some interesting items.
4;"There is a sign above the stage and above the bar that says \""Absolutely no covers\"". That alone gets this place 5 stars - giving a thriving scene to musicians that create their own work. The ceiling and walls are lined with drum heads and broken cymbals of bands who have rolled through - look hard and you'll see some names that would sell out Stage AE these days. Smoking is a downside, but it's hard to complain about it in a place like this. If you like rock, come on out. The drinks are cheap, too.\n\nAlso, I love the electronic sign above the bar that scrolls through \""fuck *your favorite place here*\"". Some of the names on the list shut down years ago - that just makes it even better."
4;I was referred to Dr. Parikh last year by Dr. Manthei after I had a Total Thyroidectomy. \n\nOn day one Dr. Parikh let me know that we were pretty much going to be best friends for life. That was very comforting considering most doctors in this town treat you like a number or an incompetent fool. Not with Parikh! I genuinely look forward to visits with him, almost like going to see a family member. He is very compassionate and genuinely cares about his patients. He has a plan of action prepared for everything and is very prompt.\n\nAppointments are always available when I need them and wait times are never long. The office staff and phlebotomists are all so nice! They are very helpful with any questions I have and even let me borrow their pens and don't get mad when I accidentally keep them.
4;I had my haircut by the same person for a couple of years. I then came out from California and worried i wouldn't find a person as good or better. I tried a place near where I  live and they messed my hair up. I went in to Mr. Nates Barber Shop and had my haircut. Nate did  a great job and was impressed with his shop. It had the old school feel. Hot towel and straight razor. I found my new spot. I will not go anywhere else again.
0;I have never purchased anything from this store simply because each time I go to purchase something, I end up putting it back, leaving the store upset, and going over to petsmart. This place has the worst customer service I've had at any type of business. Ever. Save yourself the frustration.
2;At 3am, Chipotle is closed. Qdoba is open. The end.\nWowzer the line is brutal on barnights, but worth if it you need it.\nWatching the staff get crazy angry at drunkards is a hoot as well, unless you ARE one of the drunkards.... it happens.
3;The Lady Silvia is a very mysterious lady indeed. You can walk on by and not even notice her. There are no signs or advertisements in the area to indicate she exists. It's a modern day speakeasy nestled near Resnicks when you look through the glass door it looks like an empty office space. Walk straight and push open the door that resembles a wall panel.\n\nWhen you walk in it looks like a library with vintage accents. The ceiling is decorated with graffiti. The drinks run about $12.00 to $14.00 dollars each. I had a Cherry Collins it tasted decent. I've never had a drink sprinkled with pepper before ...it was different.  I like the atmosphere because the music isn't too loud and you can carry on a conversation over it. Whatever you do don't move the furniture around they are sensitive about that. The chairs are unique and look cool so I don't blame them.\n\nIt's a perfect place to have drinks with friends because it's in a intimate space. The location downtown is low key and the there is perfect parking across the street.
3;Campus Candy is a child's dream world. If like ice cream or frozen yogurt toppings, then this is the store for you. My favorite candy are the chocolate covered espresso beans! Because they are a bit pricey, I savor them and always save a few in the back of the fridge just in case I get a craving for them.  They are loaded with chocolate and vary in size. I also love pop rocks as they remind me so much of all the childhood fun I had mixing them with Coca Cola!  They do of course have frozen yogurt to put all your candy on top of, but I don't go for the frozen yogurt, I go for ALL THAT CANDY!
4;What a WONDERFUL dining experience. When I was making plans to visit my sister in Montreal, she said that we should dine at Joe Beef (the sister restaurant). I tried making reservations and couldn't get one! So the next best thing was to try and get a reservation here, which I was able to get thankfully.\n\nLiverpool House is small, intimate, and their menu is all on a chalkboard. Sounds like an order at the counter and sit and wait for your number to be called type of restaurant, right? Well, it certainly was not. Our server was the sweetest (and cutest) guy who was so accommodating and read off everything on the chalkboard for us. We ordered a bottle of wine (a VERY impressive list that covered about two blackboards in itself!), ordered the bleu cheese chicken wings and lobster spaghetti. Oh man. The food... just incredible. The wings were unlike any kind of wings I've ever tasted. The endive leaves that accompanied it with the bleu cheese sauce was incredible. The lobster spaghetti had flavors that had so much depth... I could've kept eating it and eating it until my own gluttony consumed my foodie soul.\n\nPrices are steep but the portions are very generous. Even our server recommended that some entrees were appropriate for splitting. If you find yourself in Montreal, I highly recommend getting a reservation here (or even Joe Beef, as the menu is very similar I was told). Definitely one of the highlights of my trip to Canada.
0;I bought my company fleet vehicle, a Ford Escape. I purchased an extended warranty through Gaudin and recently had to take it in for some maintenance. Beto was our service manager and we were not happy. My husband had to constantly call and ask for service updates. Beto was not prompt in returning calls or overall communication. He told us he'd take $200 off a certain repair and would cover the tax for the second week we had the rental car. When we went to finally pick up the vehicle, Beto was on vacation. There were no notes in our file of the promises he made regarding the discount or rental car tax. We had to pay full price and wait for the manager to talk to Beto to verify things. Currently, we're still trying to get reimbursed for the rental car tax. I'm not impressed with Gaudin Ford, their communication or their customer service at all. My husband recently bought a Ford Explorer but thankfully we purchased it through CarMax instead of dealing with this dealership. I would not recommend Gaudin - at least not their service department. There doesn't seem to be much focus on ensuring positive customer satisfaction.
1;"$475 for a bottle of Tres Generaciones Tequila?!?!?!  That bottle is worth $40.  How fabulous could your table service possibly be that we would pay this much to meet HALF of your 2 bottle per table minimum?  Now, our party of 12 likes to drink.  You could have made beaucoup bucks by just letting us order our individual drinks.  Instead, we ended up dancing to your music for a little bit then moving on to bigger and better things.  You ended up with none of our money (cuz you let us in for free) and lots of empty tables.\n\nSo the place itself is lovely; very chic and sexy with lots of seating, though only if you are will to pay for their table service.  The music was great, with lots of interesting mash ups, including a mix of sexy back and Michael Jackson.  Then a weird Neil Diamond mix came on with Sweet Caroline, to which everyone sang along, which should give you an idea of the age of the crowd.  Since this is a lounge, there isn't really anywhere to dance, you're sorta dodging chairs and couches all over the place.  It was also very crowded, making it hard to move anywhere.    \n\nWeird things about the bathroom: first, the ladies room is a single stall.  So the ladies line is forever long; second, there is a bathroom attendant with a little table right outside the bathroom.  If you tip his jar, you can pick a treat from his little table: a single cigarette, mints, gum, cologne.  Am I the only one who thinks this is odd?  \n\nAnnoying rules, beautiful people, go at your own risk.  They'll probably let you in free before midnight, so it might make a good quick stop on a dance tour."
1;My friend & I had breakfast here last week & I wasn't that impressed. I must say I'm not a fan of eggs, so I can't tell u how good those were. There is a large assortment of them, frm eggs benedict to regular scrambled & several in btwn. There is a crepe section, the selection is pre-set, sort of like ordering a combo at mcdonalds. U ask for a #7 & u get a mozzarella, pesto & tomato crepe, it was pretty good, but not great. They hv a good selection of various potatoes & pastries. The croissants were good, but I wasn't impressed . I have heard good things about it so I expected better. I was especially dissapointed in their restroom, yes there is only 1 women's restroom, not several stalls. It was not clean & the soap dispenser was broken. Really? Not something you'd expect to find at this hotel. Its way too expensive & not worth it. Save some $ & take a shuttle to the Orleans buffet, a huge array of good filling food at a cheap price, generally $7.95-$13.95 or so.
0;Action Painters may be good painters, but they are also telemarketers who call people that do not want to be called.  I'm on the Do Not Call list yet these folks call.  \n\nI would not call a telemarketer for painting - ever.
1;"\""Meh, I've experienced better.\""\n\nThe service was good.  Lady was cordial and greeted us so kudos to her for that.  However, the yogurt itself was not that great and I have been to several froyo places.  The froyo here tastes kind of icy, like it's been there a while if you know what I mean.  Not the creamy-ish kind that I like (and presume how froyo \""shoud\"" taste like).\n\nAnyway, if I'm ever in the area and have a hankering for froyo, I perhaps will try again b'c service was decent but for the most part, I'd go to other froyo places that I enjoy more."
4;"The Phipps Conservatory is a beautiful place to visit or in my case go to a wedding. \n\nI went to a wedding here last Saturday (on Halloween). I had a great time. It felt like I was at a destination wedding in the Amazon. To get to the ceremony, I had to walk through the gardens to the very end. The ceremony was held in a cove; a pond with some koi were among some of the guests in attendance. \n\nThe appetizers during the cocktail hour were great. The dinner was a buffet of chicken, steak and ravioli. All the food was excellent! \n\nIf you are planning a wedding for 100 people or less this is a great option!"
2;"We stayed here on our way to Chicago for the weekend, and overall had a great stay. The Crowne Plaza Madison is an older property and its far from the \""fun\"" part of Madison, but the friendliness of the staff really made the stay decent for us.\n\nTom at the front desk was especially welcoming and personable. He made check-in a breeze.\n\nWe did see a few of the issues listed by other reviewers. The hallways had an \""smell\"" which can be attributed to the age of the hotel. Also, the wallpaper in our room was peeling in spots. Our pillows were quite awful, but in the morning I noticed that they offered a selection of other pillows, had we just called the front desk. I'll give them a pass there.\n\nOverall the place is alright. The friendly staff made up for some of the other shortfalls. It wouldn't be my first choice in Mad-Town, but really the location is the only issue that will keep me from coming back."
2;Unfortunately, I had a not-so-great experience with Alterations Express. \n\nI took 4 shirts there to be tailored, and they pinned up 2 on me at the store as model shirts to do tailor the other 2 after. The two that they had actually pinned on me in person were fine, but the 2 they had based on the models were pretty screwed up, and the arms were so tight that I couldn't bend my arms. I'd like to think its from my muscles massively growing after a trip or two to the gym - but lets face it, that's not true.\n\nOn the plus side, they stood behind their work and refunded me the cost of alterations on the 2 botched shirts, as well as the original cost I had paid to purchase them. I got a check sent in the mail within a few weeks.\n\nSadly, they were on sale at the time of purchase and I couldn't get them at the same price again. Oh well, it was worth a gamble. \n\nSo, if you're not *super* attached to the clothing you're having altered, it may be worth a shot. The prices are fair and the staff was very friendly when I went in.  But, if its a one-of-a-kind irreplaceable item, it may be worth spending a bit more somewhere else.
1;Can't say too much about the burgers... a bit over priced, I've def. had better burgers. The grease was, literally, dripping from the burger. The fries were tasteless, the buns were a bit stale. I'd rather go across the street to In-n-Out, drive 7 miles to Joe's Farm Grill or even better, drive to Four Peaks Brewery in Tempe.
1;Having heard many great things about Spinatos and having had thier pizza for lunch at work, I decided to give the restaurant a try.  I went on Monday June 11,2012 around 6:30 in the evening and it was packed, so I thought, good sign, food must be good.   This place is awful.  It was extremely loud, the service was slow and the food was mediocre.  Do not go here expecting authentic Italian food.  Its fast food italian quality at best, much like Fazolis was.  \n\nWe waited an hour for our food and the server forgot to put in our order for our appetizer which was garlic breadsticks.  The Manager came over and tried to give me a free dessert for the mixup.  I passed on the dessert, I wanted breadsticks before my meal not a dessert after.  Also, the food quality is poor.  My meal came with a greek salad.  The only thing greek about the salad was the feta cheese.   Greek salad shouldnt come with italian dressing.  \n\nI have had thier pizzas and they are good.  Anything else on the menu is mediocre.  I would order thier pizza as take out and skip the insanely loud and slow dining experience.
2;The original plan was to go to the Bellagio buffet because one of our friends had never been to Vegas before so we wanted to take her to a buffet experience and Bellagio, IMHO has the best.\n\nOf course, it was a late start and when we got there the line was so long and no one wanted to wait. So what could we do? We were starving and walked around -- this was the first place we saw -- so we went in to grab a bite.\n\nIt's one of those cafes where you order and they give you your food and you find your own place to sit.\n\nWe ordered the chorizo quiche, vegetable quiche -- both were okay, although the chorizo one tasted much better. Texturally both were the same.\n\nThe antipasto platter was nice with 3 types of meat, cheese, olives, grilled zucchini and mozzarella balls. \n\nSalmon platter was also decent with salmon laid onto flatbread and sprinkled with all the condiments you would find at a salmon spread.\n\nChef's Salad was nice too, I ordered it because I felt we should eat something healthy.\n\nOur entire bill came to approximately $62 which is pricey for a non-service cafe, but this IS the Bellagio and it tasted fine so that's all I care about. It was convenient and there wasn't a hoard of people in there.
2;I came here with some clients for dinner while I was traveling out in Phoenix.  It was nice that we were able to walk just a couple blocks down to the restaurant from our hotel downtown. \n\nThe restaurant was your ordinary, upscale (not super fancy shmancy), American steakhouse type restaurant. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kincaids-phoenix#XlxHWFp2Ggr74JU6ligrBg)\n\nFirst thing I did was order my glass of vino (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kincaids-phoenix#0ZYLhpieoAPSeolGXzoTsw)\n\nFor starters, we shared the WARM BRIE with Macadamia Nut Crust-- THIS WAS MY FAVORITE!  The Brie was smooth, creamy, and warm.  It is served with orange blossom honey, sliced apple, balsamic reduction, and fruit compote.  The brie topped with the sweetness from the honey and apples, all on a toasted baguette... Perfection!!  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kincaids-phoenix#DYiGgnpNMy9x6FIOIRRDaQ)\n\nI wasn't too hungry so I ordered the French Onion Soup (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kincaids-phoenix#r-SOD-C2SGVl9T5Q7C35bw) and the Mixed Greens with Maple Vinaigrette (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kincaids-phoenix#Ru22uO0cPVVYn_kWHT_tSw).  The French Onion Soup had that perfect layer of melted mozzarella, oozing over the side of the bowl.  The soup wasn't too salty at all, which I loved.  The salad was refreshing and surprisingly, the dressing wasn't too sweet.  It tasted great with the toasted pecans and sliced pear.
0;"I don't mean to be too harsh but I just could not make myself give this place more than one star. My husband and I took our 4-year-old son there on a Sunday afternoon to have some fun because it was 110 degrees outside and we got a coupon for them and it seemed like a fun thing to do. The coupon was for 99 cent admission plus you had to pay for skate rentals. The girl at the front booth was completely brain dead, maybe it was the heat. She took our coupon, cut it out and asked how many skates we wanted. We said three and my husband said \""can I get blades instead of skates?\"" She looked at us and said \""so you want four skate rentals for three people?\"" Well, ehem, yeah, and throw in a couple of extra ones just in case. Of course we want only three. We also wanted to buy 50 tokens for $10. She comes back and says that'll be $39. Huh? Why so much? How much are the skates? $3.50. Oh, wait, I forgot to run your coupon. Ugh. Ok, finally we figure out how much we are supposed to pay and go inside. \n\nAfter we got the skates, put them on and got on the rink we realized that there was no way our son was going to skate without a little frame for kids. Of course, you can't just get it, you have to go back to the front, get a ticket for it and go back. Fine. My husband, the only good skater in the family, left to take care of it. I'm standing by the wall with my son because I'm not a very good skater and no way I can do it with a four-year-old threatening to do a face plant every second. Well, I had three (!) employees come up to me and school me on their rules. The first one informed me that I couldn't wear a hat because if it fell blah blah blah. Fine, I took off my hat. The next two told me I could not stand by the wall because everybody had to be moving at all times. How do you expect me to move? I suppose we could've taken our skates, sat on them and pushed ourselves out of the rink. Come on! I get it you want order on the rink but we were just waiting for a couple of minutes for my husband to bring the kids frame back, not because we just wanted to hang out by the stupid wall. Give your customers a break! After I lost my patience and told the last girl what I thought about their rules they stopped the music and spent the next 3 minutes READING THE RULES TO EVERYBODY! Really? I didn't realize I voluntarily checked myself into a prison! \n\nOh, and by the way you can only take pictures in there if you have permission from the management. Yes, no pictures. Maybe they double as a secret CIA facility during the night so no photography allowed. Ridiculous.\n\nFast forward, we got our frame so we are skating in circles without hats, not stopping to stand by walls or anything. We got approached by the manager who I guess was informed that I was upset and she offered us free drinks, some tokens and refunded $5 for the frame rental. The only nice experience there. \n\nAfter we skated our son wanted to go play the machines which we did. Well, about 5-6 of them were out of order so not a big selection to choose from. But whatever. Last straw was the ticket exchange booth. And let me point out here that they are only open for 3(!) hours on Sunday so can you staff the damn place for three hours? Apparently not. When you play on machines you get tickets and then you can exchange them for \""prizes\"". Well, their booth was closed for 40 minutes! There was a line of desperate kids who wanted to get their prizes before they turned the lights off for the \""skate in the dark\"" thing and they couldn't do it because their stupid booth was closed! Seriously? So some kids had to choose between skating or exchanging their tickets. \n\nOverall and extremely frustrating experience, will never come back. There are other indoor places to go spend a Sunday afternoon at that are less infuriating."
1;Table for two was cut in half and everyone is packed against the window with people bumping into you. The restaurant is over crowded with tables and so many people you can't hold a conversation without almost yelling or moving on the other persons lap. Cocktails are $18 and $6.50 for sodas at the bar or in the restaurant. \n\n The food is really good but the portions are VERY small (except the filet it was generous but the side items are very little),  they treat you like cattle in how they pack you in!\n\n Don't sit next to the window its cramped and there is very little table space instead ask for a 6-8 person seat with even 2 to 6 people if you have 10 people they will try to pack you all in.\n\n Their tip % they ask for starts at 18% however I started at 15% and removed the $6.50 soda and $8 for two table spoons of ice cream I was charged. I know its not the servers fault for the abuse of pricing however I held them accountable.\n\nDon't order a soda and pre-game it with cocktails. I suggest ordering the Filet mignon rare its really really good and so is the Veal.\n\n Also try the hand rolled pasta side dish be sure to save room for the caramel souffle!!!\n\n Worth going up there late at night and just have the souffle and enjoy the view!
1;I came here for happy hour because the prices were pretty good. The boyfriend & I ordered 2 spicy tuna rolls, 1 spicy yellowtail roll, seaweed salad, and hot green tea. The rolls all came out together and the presentation was disgusting. I think the sushi guy was in a hurry even though there was only 2 other parties of 2 there (and I think one of them were almost done) but that's still no excuse for the food to come out looking like something I could make better in my kitchen! But as far as taste, it was alright. I don't think you can really mess up spicy tuna or spicy yellowtail rolls. As for the seaweed salad, it was also already in a bowl, covered with saran wrap, in the fridge. \n\nI would only come here because of the happy hour prices but would not come here for dinner because I'm not willing to shell out money for the service we had. :/
3;Great ambience - they have a warm, modern decor. I liked 2 of the 3 appetizers we ordered. The fig and goat cheese crostinis were good and the sliders were awesome! The rock shrimp misto was just ok (wouldn't order it again). It came with a sauce similar to soy sauce or ponzu, but would've been 10 times better with a garlic aioli. \n\nI had the warm spinach salad for my entree, which was also good. My husband had the ribeye, which he enjoyed. I stole a couple of the polenta fries that came with his steak and they were yummy! Not greasy and the batter was just right.\n\nOur service was great. We were there at 8pm on Thursday and the restaurant was about 50-60% full.\n\nAll in all, I would come back again.
2;I was intrigued by the $9.99 buffet and stopped by for lunch. There were about 6 different dishes including chicken kabobs, a couple different chicken curries, and a cauliflower dish. There were also two different dessert soups (one was like tapioca or rice pudding). I was expecting the restaurant to serve more kabobs, which was a let down. The food was mediocre.
1;"The other reviewers are spot on for this restaurant.\n\n1) Combined restaurants. This is combined with Tempe Pho. Had a Living Social Deal so thought I'd give it a try. The Asian lady (seemed like possibly a part owner) said I could get it to go but would have to pay the gratuity of 18% which seemed fair. But, she also said I would have to spend a high minimum amount before I could use the deal. That part was unexpected.\n\n2) Environment unclean. The tables were sticky and had greasy residue as if they weren't using clean washing water/soap to clean each table, but were possibly using old water without any soap. \n\n2a)  Condiment bottles were filthy on the outside as if they never cleaned or wiped them down as a regular part of the process each day. I was worried about picking up germs and bacteria by just using the condiments at the table.  The soy sauce tasted like a really off brand that I was not accustomed to. Soy sauce is of course fermented soy bean, but it did not taste like any soy sauce I've had before.\n\n2b) Forks were in a bottle/vase at each table. This doesn't seem proper by health code standards, as anyone could contaminate the utensils when they are left out like that and not individually wrapped.  I opted for chopsticks that were individually wrapped instead.\n\n3) Beverage. My iced tea was refreshing, until I reached about halfway through it and saw a flying bug floating in it that was just short of a centimeter long. I asked for a new glass, not sure if they brought me back the same glass but refilled.\n\n4) Food. The Pho noodles I got was seafood special with meat and seafood. I barely found tiny pieces of some random seafood in it that was not shrimp, not scallop, not fake crab meat, not sure what it was, but there was very little of it.  The broth was not the best I've had.  While eating the noodles, the broth turned very cloudy, which led me to think the noodles were likely not washed off, so the substance on the noodles came off into the broth.  \n\n5)  Fried wonton shrimp appetizer: The shrimp was mostly raw. I could tell by the translucency of the shrimp as well as the color and texture. I ate them, hoping I would not get food poisoning.  Fortunately, I did not.  I would have thought that the little shrimp would easily get cooked in a fryer with a thin layer of wonton around it.  So unexpected.\n\n6)  Grilled beef entree:  This was great. Grilled perfectly, not raw, tasted good with the seasoning, and it did not seem un-fresh.  This was the only thing I had no complaint about.\n\n7) Seating: Vinyl booths were not filthy as I recall. They stuck me in the front near the sound/TV controls and devices. Many cords were strewn about there.  I had trouble getting into the booth as it was partially blocked by these items.  \n\n8) Someone mentioned that they changed the names of the restaurant because of the poor reviews. Not sure how that helps since any new customers will write new reviews and unless they change something about the things people do not like, the reviews will likely be similar.\n\n9) the Asian lady (again, who seemed to be part owner), was very bossy and barked orders to the guy waiter in dreadlocks. This guy was very nice and provided good service.  She would often bark out things across the quiet, dark dining area to him.  It was strange, her interaction with him.  He did not seem to like working there, but yet still provided very good service to all of the tables.\n\nAll in all, I would not return here. I can see why they have deals with Groupon and Living Social.  I am guessing not many people return though after trying it out.\n\nFor great Pho, go to Tea Lite Cafe on May Blvd near Scottsdale Road, that is a consistently great experience, with fresh ingredients, quick service, and fair pricing.\n\nThe name of the restaurant on my Living Social deal was \""PHO TEMPE\"".  But, this is the address and restaurant that comes up. I guess this coincides with other reviewers mentioning that they have changed the name of the restaurant."
4;I wasn't sure whether to give this place 1 star or 5, because it's great because of what it is....which is a species headed for extinction: a drugstore with a lunch counter, on the Strip, and undoubtedly pre-dating 98% of its surrounding structures. \n\nSo, I recomend this less because it is a great place to eat or buy drugs(crack in the parking lot doesn't count), but as a piece of Las Vegas and American history that probably won't last much longer.
1;Ive been to Texass Roadhouse numerous times now and have really not been impressed. The rolls are good but I personally think that Logans Roadhouse has better ones (Logans are always soft and never overbaked, Texas's have been the last few times). Am I the only one that has noticed though that almost everything is wayyyy too salty? Every time I order fries here, they are doused in salt. The husband got the chicken fried sirloin last night with fries and both were super salty. The green beans have boatloads of salt too. Additionally, the ranch dressing tastes like crappy bottled Kraft dressing. One final thing that was a no go for me is that their fresh steamed vegis were terrible. Last night, their broccoli was not trimmed enough the ends of it were very hard and fibrous and the carrots were not cooked enough so they were still hard. Booooo. I am not a fan of vegis as it is but when eaten this way, I really despise them.\nNow what has been good is their chili although it is a bit rich. Its very meaty so if I ever have to go here (with a group of people, I wont come here on my own), I would just get a bowl of this and have some rolls. The husband also says that the ribs are great. They are always fall of the bone tender. Aside from that, we are unimpressed with everything else. One other thing is that their portions are fairly large. However, the food, as mentioned is kinda crappy so if you like eating lots of crappy uninspired food, this is your place. I have nothing against chain restaurants but this is one of those that I don't get what the hype is about (see my list of overhyped places). This place is always busy and the wait is at least an hour each time I have been to this location. They don't take reservations or call ahead.\nI would advise to try Logans instead. Not only do they have better rolls but their menu is better and has more selections. Logan's food is always better as well and they have sweet potato fries which is one of my weaknesses. Also, their wait is never bad. Sorry Texass but in my opinion, you kinda suck.\n\nPS: If you hate kids, DO NOT COME HERE. They are everywhere! The staff also seems to have a hard time accommodating large groups and there is not enough space in the area where they pile the large groups. You literally cannot move and the waiters have a hard time getting around the tables.
2;"The Lodge is the manliest of manly bars. And when I say manly I mean, Midwestern manly, put on your camo's and trucker hat, pack up your PBR, jump in the F150 and head out to set up post and shoot some f'n deer... type of manly. There are stuffed animal carcasses and heads everywhere, chandeliers made out of elk antlers, carved wooden bar stools and bears (ahem Adam W.. carved wooden bear alert!) and tree logs used in every way possible to decorate. I think there was also a fire place, but I was so fascinated by the post taxidermy coyote that was posing so mysteriously on the mantle. I guess its because anything dog related I am gravitated to.. either way, its always interesting looking at something so close that you've never seen before. That or I'm 5 years old. \n\nAnother type of manly is that they use grilled cheese sandwiches as the BUN for a burger my friend ordered. Seriously,  a hamburger patty with all the fixings in between 2 grilled cheese's. Maybe this isnt manly, aside from the ability to be able to devour that much food..  so maybe its just ungodly fatty and unhealthy. Anyone participating in the \""Fat Off\"" should not come here to eat. At all. And anyway I tried that burger, and it wasn't the shit. However, I did enjoy the criss cut fries and their ranch dressing is to die for. I need the recipe now. I crave that flavor.\n\nIts an interesting location for a place like this to be.. hidden among the trendy brodeo joints that I avoid like the plague. I liked the rustic feel this place had, and felt like drinking my Makers on the rocks was completely acceptable in a place like this. I don't care if its an 85 year old man drink, I love it and no one at the lodge looked at me like I had 10 heads when i ordered it, like everyone else does at most places I go. Plus Its got an extremely decent outdoor patio area fully equipped with heat lamps for those brisk desert evenings. Waitresses are nice, and cute which is always a plus, and the bathrooms didn't make me gag. So bravo. \n\nI don't see this place as becoming a regular stop while in Old Town, but I wouldn't mind going again. They have a super happy hour thing going on.. $3 beers, half price apps, $6 burger & beer.. cant beat that, plus  I love log cabins, and this place certainly reminded me of just that!"
2;"This place is pretty good...the people are really nice also.\nThe selection I guess is pretty ok. If there is something you don't see coming around, you can ask for it to be made for you, but that kinda goes for most revolving sushi places.\nThey do have a fairly extensive \""off the conveyor belt\"" menu...like steak and stuff. And if you have picky kids they also carry burgers, chicken tenders and fries.\nThe desserts they have going around the belt are better than I've seen at some revolving sushi restaurants.\nAs for the prices...it's a bit more expensive than what I'm used to paying for revolving sushi. I can pay about $20 or so other places and get quite a bit of food, as where this place I can pay about $35 or so and get a little less food than I normally could. Which kinda sucks...but it is what it is I guess.\nAnyway...I've been here about 2 times or so now...still debating if I should return. I'm hoping that once the business picks up (it's been dead the last 2 times I've gone) maybe they'll drop the prices on some stuff."
4;Tony has hit the nail on the head, no pun intended. I've dealt with these people for years and have been more than happy. Belive it or not they once recomended a less expensive tire that would fit my needs better than the tire I thought  I needed
3;"So I have been wanting to find a gym that I feel \""comfortable\"" and have great hours.  Well, this gym pretty much did this for me.\n\nThe fact that it is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year is great so you can go anytime you want.  The only down side- this place is packed constantly.  I am still trying to find a time where its less busy, but when you live in Las Vegas- I doubt that is possible.\n\nThey have a women's only gym on the first floor as well as a weight room that I have only seen dudes in.  They have massive amounts of cardio machines on the top floor as well as rooms for instructor classes.  From what I remember you can go to any classes for free and you can meet with a trainer (once a month) for free.  Pretty nice.  \n\nI'm on a challenge right now- going to the gym everyday for the next 3 weeks (before I make a trip) so if you see me- say hello! :)"
0;Staff made you feel as if they were doing you a favor by waiting on you. Owner on the phone and didn't even acknowledge the customer.  Food was awful. Will never go back
0;The worst McDonald's ever. They never get the order right. They are slow. And speak horrible English!
3;I have to say that their service is very good, they saw my review and asked me to go back to fix my hair. This time I was assigned to Tony, and he understood what I want, gave me a complimentary haircut and told me what to do afterwards. He's very professional on haircut, and I'll ask him to cut my hair next time.
1;Breakfast was mediocre at best. Bland. Not cozy. We live close and never go here so it's just not our fav breakfast place. Service was ok.
1;"Honestly, I don't know if I will go back here. I walked in and there was nobody inside but the staff. We decided to do all you can eat and the waitress told us we could do half orders which I always like, you can try more and not have to worry about eating a lot of something that wasn't good. Halfway through our lunch though the sushi chef said \""no more half rolls!\"" Is it so much harder to make a half portion or something. Like I said, we were the only ones in the restaurant so we definitely weren't adding to his blistering workload.\nNext the quality of the fish was questionable. The tuna poke had strands in it equivalent to the gristle, or cartilage, in meat. All the fish lacked flavor, had a poor texture and worst of all, everything was literally room temperature. That is the last thing you want when eating sushi. \nThe staff worked slowly, again, only customers in the restaurant, the waitress offered no recommendations because \""I don't eat sushi.\"" \nNeedless to say, I probably won't be going back even with all of their \""eat here we are new\"" ploys and specials."
0;I have been through this airport more times than I wish and I have yet to find the sky priority security lane. To my knowledge it does not exist. With this many people coming through here it should be easier to access. Every week travelers should have the ability to bypass the long line of weekend gamblers.
0;I purchased a pair similar to these. After about two years of gentile use, the thong on the left sandal fell apart. Since Dillards won't accept returns items this old and because it appears to be an obvious defect, I wrote to Cole Haan for a replacement. All they could offer me was a 30% discount off of my next purchase. Pretty poor customer service in my opinion. I really thought Cole Haan quality was superior and that stye would stand behind their products if something went wrong. Turns out I was wrong. Others need to consider this before paying a premium to purchase Cole Haan products.
3;We went on a Thursday night for date night.  The atmosphere is dark and intimate with live music playing lightly in the background.  The sommelier, while very helpful and tailored choices to our price range, kind of creepped up on us and never actually introduced herself to us.  She just stood over our shoulders and asked if we needed help.  It was an odd start, but after that she was friendly.\n\nFoodwise, the crab cakes were delicious and I'd go again just to order those!  We split a 26 oz double eagle bone in ribeye.  For being a double eagle steak house, our steak was good (moist and juicy sealed with a light char) , but I've had better.  We also ordered the asparagus and lobster mac & cheese.  The sides portions are pretty big and we ended up with a lot leftover.  Although we had leftovers, we still made room for warm banana bread pudding with a healthy scoop of ice cream on top.  It was a wonderful warm/cold contrast to seal off the night.\n\nThe service was attentive and timely.  We did notice an error on our bill and pointed it out to our server.  Afterwards, the manager came over to apologize and advise us he took care of our dessert for the error.  It was definitely unexpected and confirmed their dedication to excellent customer service.\n\nWe had heard rumors of the famed James Bond wine table here, so we asked the hostesses on the way out.  They were really nice and showed us the book with the special hidden button to open up the table and let us look around.  Although you can't drink any of the wine, it's definitely a sight to see.\n\nDel Frisco's gets my date night seal of approval.
4;We were in need of a regular maintenance on our hvac units. Scheduling was a breeze. They were able to get a technician out to our house as early as we needed. The technician that came was extremely professional and knowledgable. He performed the maintenance for us and had recommendations on how to have a more efficient system. We were extremely happy with the service from all aspects and will refer them to others and use them again in the future.
3;"\""My boyfriend ate my menu.\""\n\nFortunately, the menus at Sweets Raku are actually edible. That's right, you can EAT your menu. Although it's not that tasty, it still makes for a nice photo op!\n\nOnto other things...\n\nMy boyfriend and I shared the prixe fixe menu. We ordered Mt. Fuji for the main dessert. The first course was some sort of green tea custard, which had a nice light flavor. It was a very small portion, but just right. Second course was the main dessert, Mt. Fuji (chestnut cream cake). It was awesome to watch them make this one. The texture was so soft, hence the \""cream cake\"" description. It almost tasted like a tiramisu, but better. It came with a few chips stabbed into it, which was nice for dipping into the outer layer and eating. The third course was a mini lava cake dessert with homemade marshmallows and alcohol infused raisins on the side. It was soo rich and soo good. The perfect ending. \n\nPros: \n-the place is spotless\n-service is great. They are very attentive and even open the door for you on your way out \n-dinner and a show: you get to watch your dessert being made right before your eyes! Of course, most of it is already premade, but you get to see it being put together in a very artistic fashion. \n-the bathroom is incredible!! It's something you have to see for yourself\n-you can share the prixe fixe menu at an extra cost, which I highly suggest (I don't think I could've finished everything on my own)\n-I don't know what kind of milk they use, but its sweet and delicious! \n\nCons:\n-the bathroom door doesn't close all the way unless you give it an extra pull. Someone actually walked in on me. Luckily I was already done with my business!\n-the waitress took my coat, but forgot to give it to me on my way out. I almost forgot about it completely\n\nAll in all, I think this is a great place for dessert, especially if you're trying to go somewhere different with a great ambiance."
3;Almost become my first choice of shopping as it have a lots of Asian food. I really enjoy the complex cultures and the variety but it's really hard to look for a specific items cause sometimes they don't carry it anymore. But I still gonna come by here everytime I do my monthly shopping cause this place is near my house. Stat!
3;I've had very good experiences as a member here. One big positive are the classes, which are numerous and led by fun instructors who know their stuff. Also, personal TVs keep me doing cardio way longer than planned.\n\nAs a rule, all the spaces are clean and well-organized. The staff are polite and helpful. The parking, if you need it, is cheap ($1 for 2 hours) and convenient. \n\nMy only gripe is that, from 4:45-6pm, Mon-Thurs, things get a little tight, but it's workable, and I've never been a member of a gym where this wasn't a reality.
2;I was caught off guard immediately upon searching for this place and realizing it was in a strip mall.  I guess that's how everything in Phoenix is, but I imagined that a nice restaurant would have found some way to break free....guess not.\nIt was bustling and hopping when we arrived.  I was a little let down when I saw the menu, as I made a reservation here based on the online menu and it was completely different.  For instance, I was psyched for the squash blossoms, but they were gone.  Upon mentioning this to the waitress, she appeared irritated that I mentioned them and immediately warned me that there was no way to get them, as everyone asks now that they are off the menu.  I wasn't going to ask....was just bummed at how different the menu was.  In addition, it seemed smaller than the offerings listed online, but I didn't want to get into that with her.\nWe ordered and I decided on 2 appetizers--the chilled corn and chorizo soup and the lobster gnocchi.  It was weird, as the two dishes provided such opposite experiences.  The soup was a good consistency, but I couldn't help but think that maybe the chef had accidentally poured 2 tons of sugar into it, because it was cloyingly sweet.  I could barely finish it, and when I did, wasn't sure I didn't just have dessert.  The bites with chorizo were better, but overall, it was just grossly sweet.  Even my friend who LOVES sweet food was complaining.\nHowever, the lobster gnocchi dish was excellent.  There was lots of lobster and it was perfectly prepared--tender and sweet.  The gnocchi seemed to have been pan-fried, which added a nice texture to the dish.\nLove the cotton candy--especially since it was blue raspberry, my favorite Slurpie flavor!\nJust before dessert, the power went out , which mean the A/C was gone.  On a day that had been 115 degrees, this was only tolerable for a brief period.  We abandoned our dessert--the chocolate chip cookies (which I thought were really good with a little sea salt on top, but everyone else complained about) and made for the door.
4;What a great deal! I would come back to get another haircut
2;"Three words :  Beer.  Can.  Chicken.\n\nQuite possibly the best hangover dish ever.  Ever heard the saying, \""Alcohol Cures Alcohol?\""  Ok, maybe this wasn't the case exactly, but that chicken was DAMN good!  I ate it up!  And of course, washed it down with a pitcher of Blue Moon.  The Harley Davidson Cafe did me and my girls well!  The food was a lot better than I expected, despite the cheesy motorcycle coming out of the building in the front.  I thought, it was going to be crummy to tell you the truth.  But, this was not the case.  Everything was delicious!   Or it could be the fact that  we were starving since we only ate \""Flamin' Hot Cheetos\"" for dinner the night before.  \n\nEither way it was a very satisfying meal.  \n\nThe only thing I wouldn't suggest  at this place is to eat outside under the scorching Las Vegas sun!  I mean, they do have umbrellas that supply some sort of shade if their umbrellas actually DID work. Most of them kept tilting sideways, which was pretty annoying."
4;The burgers & street tacos have a unique taste & style to them. Also, the french fries come in a assortment (waffle, straight, etc.). Mix that in with the Las Vegas atmosphere and its experience I wont forget.
1;I am going to have to agree with Jordi, this experience was very sub-par.  The place was dead and our service sucked.  My whiskey drink was the best part of the entire experience.  I ordered the Caesar Salad with chicken.  It was pretty bland for a Caesar but the croutons were good I guess.   I tried some of the pizza and while liking the Dough (I Love Bread) the pizza toppings and sauce were not that great.  I might come back and give this place a try again just because there are always those days.  But there are so many awesome places to eat in this area why bother.  I like trying new places better than places I did not like twice.
4;Two for two. This becoming my new favorite place
1;"Visited this restaurant last Sat. with good friends we frequently dine-with.  We've always liked this place, the ambience and casual atmosphere.  Much surprised to see a new menu (been away too long apparently).  The meal: Wait person made a big deal about tips and drinks are not included in Restaurant Week promo.  We weren't there for that reason, never mentioned it.  My wife asked for horseradish to accompany her fillet, was told \"" I'll check with the Chef, I think we took it off the menu.\""  Say what?   Our nothing-special meals were served, and within minutes of having desert our checks were presented.  Problem: We never asked for them, and the server took the liberty to assigned orders to separate checks without being asked to do so.  We normally split the check.  Overall the price paid for food and drinks was high.  Might go back, but not for a while.  Sorry."
4;The best barber shop just off the strip. I brought my whole wedding party.  We all had Haircuts, Fades and one hawk.  The guys all had their first straight razor shaves.  The (beer) beverages Top the experience off perfect.  It was the greatest time, what a party great haircuts very Inexpensive.  Highly recommended !
4;Quickie review: This is my favorite Thai spot. They never disappoint with food. I love the restaurant itself. And we usually receive top-notch service. Though I have moved further away now...I continuously go out of my way to frequent this gem.\n\nFood: \nThis place has a wide-array of food to choose from. You'll probably notice from other reviews that Komol does have a good vegetarian/vegan selection. I don't mean like 10 choices...I mean pages of vegetarian/vegan options. They have a lot to choose from and with their various serving sizes, from individual to family meals...they can accommodate any group situation.\n\nThere food quality is always top-notch and they're consistent. People like to counter good reviews about Komol saying that Lotus of Siam (in the same shopping center) is better. While I will not deny the quality of Lotus....when it comes to a quality/cost ratio....Komol wins. \n\nPad Thai, Pad Zee Ew, Herbal Salad, Go See Me, Tom Kha and their curries are generally among the dishes we always order. For a taster, try there individual vegetarian meals (which they will make un-vegetarian for you)...you'll get to try appetizers, a soup and a large entree for the price for a great price. Not to mention, they have amazing lunch specials which basically make you feel like you ripped THEM off considering the amount of food you get and what you paid for it. Seriously. \n\n\nAtmosphere:\nThough the restaurant is getting more and more popular, it still has the feel of a quiet little spot. Pictures and artwork on the wall give it a home decor and their carved wood menu holders are an interesting touch.\n\nService:\nTypically, Komol has fast and friendly service. When's it's busy, the food may take a little long but it has never been ridiculous. The staff is willing to offer suggestions and are happy to introduce you to surprise dishes that you might have overlooked in their voluminous menu. Our last visit was a very rare night of bad service....like really bad....but I am going to chalk that up to a new server. If this becomes a trend, I will change my rating.  But, on the whole, all of our visits have been pleasant.\n\nOverall, if you want a great meal, especially with a group that wants to avoid checks that will easily hit the triple-digit mark like at Lotus, come to Komol. Their food never disappoints and you usually leave stuffed to the point of shame. And that's saying a lot considering I am the same guy who has zero shame about pounding down a triple-chili burger from Tommy's and can happily look at myself in the mirror.
1;This place does not live up to the hype. Yes, a lot of variety and a lot of food. But at best, the quality is just OK and at worst, not very good. No stand outs here.....the sald bar is acceptable. With that said, it is much better than the Seafood Buffet on the other side of the casino. That buffet is disgusting and way over priced.\n\nTrust me, pay a few more dollars and go to The Wynn buffet. You'll be glad you did.
4;I remember this place.  Years ago, we used to eat here like once a month, when my family lived in Germany.  We would always order whatever was on the menu that was closest to America home food, lol.   It was a nice way for our family to get out and do something different so Mom didn't have to cook.  \n\nIt had a nice atmosphere inside, and the service was really friendly.  The food was great, which was why we always went back, lol.  I kind of miss this place...   I wish I had pictures of it.
0;the outdoor seating is empty and they won't seat us there... they just want everyone to sit inside and uses the outside to entice customers to come in... we ate here but since it was so unmemorable, it probably was just so so and we won't be back!
4;From start to finish this hotel made our Vegas stay just grand.\n\nFree valet?! Rooms setup like mini condos, including dishes, a blender, fridge, microwave, toaster, and everything you could ask for?! And a HUGE balcony patio?! I love it!\n\nAnd only a block or so away from the strip. So awesome.\n\nGot this room on a livingsocialdeals. Such a bargain for $217 for two days.\n\nWe'd be back.
3;Very high quality Japanese food.  Crab fried rice was a must order, chicken wings were good, and so was the lobster ramen (can't share that one). \nPortions are not huge, these are mostly small tapas style plates. Fair pricing for the strip, clever cocktail menu. Would definitely come back. Each person would probably get 2.5-3 dishes, so spend about 50 bucks a head before drinks.
2;"3 stars is being generous. The lure is probably the mixed drinks menu, but we don't drink. The food overall was tasty. We had 2 appetizers, 3 main meals & dessert. The food was tasty and a little different than usual border Mexican fare. The ambiance is very plain in a small space and is no doubt nicer outside in the alcove or on the side where there is live piano music. They don't offer coffee \""in the summer.\"" (????) All the waiters help out at each table so you don't have a problem with service. However, the service is relatively impersonal. I wouldn't recommend and certainly not for families with children."
4;Haven't been to Lemont in many a year!  Always liked the food and service was impeccable!   Well it hasn't changed!\n\nThe maitre'd showed our small group to a great table in the corner.  Yes!, what a great view!  Had reservations for a friends birthday...special occasion.  Fun to watch boats on the river, the incline and planes flying over the Northside..oh excuse me, it is now the North Shore.  We did go mid-week so it was not crowded.\n\nWe had a few kids, ages 11 to 14, and the maitre'd and server were so good at making sure they could order just about anything they wanted.  They had a long list of ideas not on the menu, since everything is made to order.  Fantastic!  Server went way above and beyond, like you would expect at a top notch restaurant.\n\nThe tables were so sweet!  Shiny table ware and glasses.  Fancy plates and linens, it is nice to dine out.  We ordered some Champagne to start off and waiter made sure to ask about the type we preferred, Brut, Asti or semi???  Great job!\n\nServer also suggested we not over order apps, and extras and told us about the roasted tomato that came with our meal.  Started with a couple of apps, escargot alio was so nice with garlic, not seen much anymore but fun to see the kids try!  The crepes fontinia were delicious.\n\nHad a classic, the Lemont salad, nice fresh greens served with the Lemont vinaigrete, really enjoyable.  \n\nThe meal came with assorted fresh bread and was refilled when needed.\n\nHad the Veal loin rib chop for two that was cooked perfectly, tender and sweet.  Others had the salmon, New York Strip steak and a special kids spaghetti. Everyone loved their meals and how they were cooked. Managed to get a bite of the spaghetti when the young one next to me keep saying this is better than grandmom's.  It was very good indeed.\n\nWhen you go you have to try the deserts.  We decided to get a couple of the old tried and true cooked tableside so the kids, big kids too, could watch and try deserts they have never seen.  The Baked Alaska and Bananas Foster were sweet and very good, as was the coconut cake.  Deserts were passed around and the Bananas were the fav.\n\nLemont can be a little pricey if you order extras, but not to bad if you stick to the basics, but  you get really good food and service.  This is a top notch place during the week.  \n\nWhat a great experience!
4;This place is a must when in Vegas. I stop by at least once when I come to town and everybody I've brought has loved it. Good portions, great drinks, tons of flavor and reasonable prices make Guy's Vegas Kitchen + Bar the place to go on the strip!
3;Amongst the clutter and noise of Las Vegas there is a serene corner of lovely ambiance that is Dal Toro. To be honest I didnt know what to expect as I walked in. I knew very little of the place and much less about the menu. I was welcomed with open arms by the manager Pat, who painstakingly explained the menu and the nuances of the extrordianry meal I was about to have. I was given a wonderful seat at the patio that gave me not just a view of the strip but of my lovely date. i was blown away by the causal luxury of the meal. Delicious yet understated, the suggested wine pairing only accentauted the taste. The service was flawless, the food delicious and the experience magical. I could not have asked for more from an evening out.
2;Man this place has been around FOREVER. I remember going here as a kid.\n\nSmoked pork hocks, ribs, schnitzle are their specialties. Have never tried the fish.  This place used to be really good, now it's just OK. The pork hocks are salty and not fantastic.. but there are bus loads of Asian folks coming in from Toronto as apparently there are no smoked pork hocks in Toronto the staff say? \n\nThis place is an old tavern.. the beer is good but I won't go out of my way to return. It's just not what it used to be, unfortunately.  If you are in the area though, I would stop in and check it out. It's definitely a staple in the area, although doesn't sound like many locals go there anymore.
0;This restaurant is expensive with poor food and service. Not very clean and not very cool. \nThey ripped me off on the guacamole and the sour cream\n  Both were 5.00 offered with the dish, the up charge was not disclosed.
2;I enjoy this location, well because it's location....I live across the street. I tend to order and go so my say on dining in is not accounted for. I used to go to the location in Dillworth and would dine in the location since it was a far drive. \n\nI come from a long bloodline of Colombian rice and bean meals and I truly enjoy them here. I also like their soups. I would definitely say try this one or both locations out.
1;its okay. but, WHERE'S MY CHECK?? are they giving free meals to random people? man it took 5 minutes for them to find us a seat. about 15 minutes for the food. 20 minutes to eat. and waiting forever for the check. wtf? free meal? let us know so that we can leave asap.
2;I'll give it 3 stars because I have had more good than bad washes. I like it because it's touchless. I found last year when my girl got a new beemer. It's also works for lifted trucks. I've had issues at other washes with my trucks before. The only real issue I ever had was when a homeboy that came up to my girl to take her order called her cheap because she drove a nice car and didn't want the most expensive wash. He's very lucky I wasn't there, or he would have got his ass whooped!!! Needless to say I took the high road and called the manager. She was supposed to give my girl her next wash for free. Of course when she went back a week later it wasn't on her acct. I had to call down there and regulate. She ended up getting her free wash, and I still to this day never saw the punk that ran his mouth. Like I said though, the majority of the washes are good.
3;Very large restaurant - tables are elbow to elbow. Went for breakfast and had the banana nut pancakes (yum!) and hubby had some egg sandwich extravaganza that the table next to us was oping and ashing over. Friendly service, great prices, good coffee. Definitely could become a habit.
1;First time at this location last night .  We went late in the evening and had a party of 3.  Got some drinks at the bar which was fine and then sat and waited for our table .  It was quite humid and hot where we were waiting as the air vent was dripping cause the humidity .  While we waited , not one person came to check on us or tell us why it was taking so long to be seated .  We finally were sat a table in the back after 25 min or so waiting .  Took approx 10 min before we had anyone come take our order .  We all ordered fairly simple food and only 1 time did anyone come to us to offer drinks .  We sat for nearly 45-50 min waiting patiently for our food and once we got it , no apologies or explanation.as to why it took so long .   We all had pretty much lost or apatite and barely even 10 min after getting our food , had our server come to us and ask us if we wanted desert (seriously lady ??!?) As we were waiting for our check the manager ( older lady with a raspy quick tone) was across from us , apologizing to another couple that was waiting nearly as long as us , for the wait .  No one came and asked how we were or how our service was or apologized for the delay .  Needless to say we paid and left dissatisfied and upset .  I have eaten at the old town location countless times and have always had superb service and food .  We will most likely not be returning to this location .
2;I ordered a basic baked lasagna with marinara and a side salad with ranch. The side salad was fine but they didn't chop it up like I asked. My ranch was also warm and they took an hour and 15 minutes to get here. People are very nice over the phone and in person. My lasagne tasted incredibly salty and looked very strange. The sauce almost resembled chili and the lasagna was drowning in it. Every Rosatis I go to is always hit or miss and incredibly inconsistent. From Glendale to Chandler to Surprise, it either is great or just absolutely amateur. Take a guess what this one was....
0;If you are looking for cheap on the strip go somewhere else for cheap.  This place is horrible.  \n1) Check in took over an hour\n2) They couldn't even give us directions to our room\n3) The room looked like a Motel 6 room\n4) Noisy, as in the walls are very thin and you can hear the conversation in the room next to you at all hours. \n\nDon't stay if you have a choice.  Spend a few bucks more so you don't feel like you have to Purell every 5 minutes in your room.
4;Wow! I was really impressed with this whole in the wall. I heard from a few friends how good this place was but didn't get a chance to try until today. I ordered the spicy korean chicken with mushroom and onions. It was far beyond excellent.  I saw a gentlemen order the samw thing but instead of white rice he got fried rice. I guess I'll have to come back to give that a try.  But for now, this place earns a 5 star from me!
1;"I always feel like i need a good scrub down after returning from Las Vegas, especially from the airport. \nYIKES\nThe Southwest terminal is horrendous; a petri dish of the trashiest people from all over the country. Coarse, skanky, greasy. \nThe check-in lines are usually LONG, esp on Sunday. The cab lines are just as horrendous\nThe Baggage Claim is Also Horrendous. I've never waited for a piece of luggage that long except maybe at OAK. \nThe Virgin America Terminal is a tad better. \nThe Free Wifi is super helpful though...thank goodness"
1;food is massive but size does not overcome quality even for us big people :-)
4;FINALLY, a place to satiate my ramen needs!  Potato croquette!  Curry katsu! There is hope for the Charlotte Asian dining scene! \n\nYes, the previous reviews are spot on-- authentic Japanese (minus the obligatory California roll and special sushi rolls) in a super charming space (Don't be thrown off by it's location next to the Little Caesars.) with friendly family-run service.)\n\nThis place is packed with fellow Asians (not the speed-racing kind like Ru San's) which is always a good sign.  \n\nTIP: Get the lunch special A or B.  You'll see examples of A and B at the front of the restaurant.  The special is $8 and is plenty of food.  (Last time, it was a curry katsu bowl and a bowl of miso ramen. The other was a mini version of the dinner bento box.) \n\nTo the reviewers who had poor sushi experiences, claiming the rolls are similar to the pre-packaged ones at the supermarket, and un-fresh: I urge you to try Musashi again. I always find the rice perfect and room-temperature and seasoned well. Also: to those who complain the sushi menu is small, yes, it's less than a page.  However, who wants a phone-book-sized-menu if the food isn't good? \n\n(If you want to talk supermarket sushi, DYK restaurants like Soul Gastrolounge actually serve the supermarket brand as their own...and nobody knows!  In fact, it's pretty good, considering.) \n\nI also don't think the service is unfriendly at all!  Maybe being busy and task-oriented (not taking time to chit-chat) is mistaken for unfriendliness...I duno, I just call it efficient! \n\nTIP #2: You can't get their udon or ramen to-go.\n\nBottom Line:  If you're accustomed to some noodle houses in New York or LA, or in cities with large Asian communities, no, this place isn't going to be on the same level-- but sometimes you don't need all the frills.  Just a solid meal, run by a family you can tell knows what they're doing.
4;I miss Papa Del's, even if I live in a pizza wonderland, I remember Papa Del's fondly for where to go in Chambana if you wanted really good, really hearty, deep dish style pizza.  The sauce if very flavorful, and the crust can take it.  I prefer eat in, and never really got papa del's for delivery, but did carry out occasionally.  It does suffer from sogginess when put in that cardboard box, better eaten fresh on location on a plate with a knife and fork.  Not the cheapest pizza in Champaign, just the best.
1;"Cramped seating is an understatement; either that, or I'm a double wide kind of guy!  The video quality was good, sound was good; seats were just too tight, no shoulder room."
2;We were here for NYE this past New Years for the grand opening of the club.\n\nTiesto was spinning, it was New Years Eve, and my baby's birthday, so I splurged for a VIP table.  Was it worth it?\n\nWell, the club was a bit small, the lighting, video, and sound systems were amazing however.  \nThere were some problems with service though:\nThe VIP bottle service client's list got screwed up somehow, so when we arrived that night, they took us to someone else's table, then found out that it belonged to someone else, so we had to be moved.  That kinda sucked, but it may have been attributed to that night being the public grand opening.\n\nOur table hostess Angela was awesome and she totally helped us have an awesome time.  \n\nOverall, I'd probably come back and give it another shot to see if the service issues were an anomaly.  But I'd probably consider Pure or XS before this club.
4;"Great place to go workout or relax! Workout here every Tues/Wed/Thurs with the Marines at 0600. It's a perfect location to start a run, you can run around all or half of Tempe Town Lake, go through the hilly paths of Papago or even head down Mill to \""A\"" Mountain or ASU's Main Campus.\n\nThe scenery is great and there is a huge open grass area along with a playground and softball field. The bathrooms are kept very clean and there are consistently cleaning crews picking up and doing maintenance. It's a great place to go workout or relax.\n\nThe only downside is when there is going to be a big event because the parking lot is kind of small. At times to make matters worse, they've shut down half of it to accommodate for the crews setting up the events days before hand.\n\nOverall, awesome park... Thank you Tempe!"
1;Previously this would have been a 4-5 star review but the last two times that I have ordered during the lunch hour  my calzones have been burnt and the fries have been over done (nice word for burnt). I used to love ordering from DP Dough because the food was awesome. Once they get a new cook then I may re-evaluate their resturant but unfortunately right now they are no longer one of my favorite resturants.
2;My mom and I visited this theater over the weekend to see Breaking Dawn and with the two free movie passes I found online, I couldn't pass up the deal.  Our theater was mostly empty which was nice and we ordered once we sat down.  I got the chicken tenders and a sweet tea and my mom ordered a grilled cheese.  We both got our food before the movie started, so within 5-10 mins, and mine wasn't even warm.  It was maybe lukewarm at best.  The sweet tea was too sweet and I received marinara sauce with my chicken strips instead of honey mustard.  I agree with what someone else said about the waiters being distracting running in front of the screen.  Luckily there was no one in front of us so it wasn't as much of a distraction but I can see how it would be.\n\nThe back row of seats are semi nice chairs with little tables but the front rows are merely swivel office chairs that they placed in there. Kind of tacky.  Don't know if I'd go back besides for the free coupons.
3;Great food beer and wine.This is a great place to have fish & chips & watch the games!
0;"These grindz were not ono!! Over cooked my chicken katsu really bad. Gave me the smallest amount of sauce ever. And no wonder my chicken was so over cooked it took over 15 minutes to make and it wasn't even busy. So disappointed. They offer four sides besides rice, and long rice is one of them which is awesome.  Too bad they were all cold. They put my sides in the box right in front of me when I ordered and let it sit there while my katsu was being cooked a lot crispier than should be. The chicken was rough, border line jerky status. I figured I'd give the place a chance based on all the good reviews. You people are nuts, of this is the best Hawaiian local food you can find there's a problem. I'm sick of all these fake \""Hawaiian\"" restaurants. They're all just weak Korean bbq's ran by people who don't know anything about adding that aloha to a plate. I don't like giving such bad reviews but I'm sincerely upset about wasting $10 on a very poor plate lunch that had me in there 20 minutes. The cashier didn't have any enthusiasm. The whole vibe was just sad. No aloha! I'll just stick to golden Hawaiian BBQ off southern and dobson. At least when I wait forever there, the food is good. And not overpriced."
3;My family and I ate breakfast here on a Sunday morning while on vacation. There are a ton of options. I had the Hawkeye omolette. It was very good. My wife had poached eggs, bacon and pancakes. My daughters each had a nice sized kids breakfast for $5. The portions are generous and the prices were what you would expect for a decent breakfast. The service was excellent. I would definitely come back here.
2;Very large retail outlet. sandwhiches are nice and tasteful. although i was seriously dissapointed with how overpriced the food was.
3;Lovely little spot to get some good eats! As the name implies, all of the items are packed and ready to take away, however there is also a small bar with a few stools if you'd like to eat in or sip on a coffee right there. The menu has different features appearing on a weekly basis and this week the quinoa salad was delectable. I'm definitely going back again very soon.
0;Use to come here often. Had the worst service ever this evening. Food took over an hour. No apology from server or owner. Was simply told by server that she doesn't control the kitchen. Will never return and will spread the word about lack of service.
0;Dave & Busters lite!  If you have a choice between Dave & Busters or here go to Dave & Busters!!! Loud and smelly!!
3;Love this place for pedicures. She really makes sure each toe is perfect and the foot massages feel amazing. However, I came here once for a gel manicure and she was really rushed because there were three people waiting after me. The manicure came out shoddy and blotchy.\n\nShe doesn't have the best nail polish selection, but she has some of the best prices I've seen in Pittsburgh.\n\nCome during the weekdays (the earlier the better) on days you know you don't have any meetings to rush to afterwards. Since it is mostly just Lynn manning the shop, she can get pretty backed up with appointments. I've had to wait for it to be my turn but sometimes she'll let you sit in one of the super comfortable massage chairs.
4;Hands down, the best bowling alley in the Scottsdale area! \n\nI used to live in close proximity to Brunswick Via Linda, but now, even though I'm about a 30 minute drive away (and shamefully, kind of a downtown Phoenix city snob) I'm still willing to make the trip! That's saying alot if you know me. \n\nLane conditions are great! Food and drink selection is great (make sure to order the soft pretzels with cheese)! Clientele is never sketchy/weird/off/waiting for you to bowl so they can run away with your belongings type people. It doesn't feel like drug deals are being made in and around the property. Deals and prices are amazing! And the staff...OMG they are SO HELPFUL! \n\nAt most bowling alleys I feel like most of the staff hates their lives, but that's not the case here. Everyone is excited about bowling, the music they're playing and the deals they're offering. Scott is the man you want to talk to, but if he's not around or busy, everyone is just as excited, helpful and willing to steer you in the right direction! I go here quite often so this is definitely not a one experience Yelp. This place never fails!
2;"First of all I love burgers and I love boutique burgers. So on my latest 3 day burger tour of Vegas this was my first stop.\n\nThere's good and bad about this place, but one thing is for sure - it's somewhat overrated and and definitely overhyped.\n\nFirst, the service and the vibe are kind of lame. Very tourist trap vibe and very \""Vegasey\"". I had the Farm burger and truffle fries. The fries were not cooked well and I didn't enjoy them at all. The burger patty was perfectly formed and beautifully cooked. The problem is that it's not all that flavorful...underseasoned, no good flame or smokey flavor. If it was better seasoned it would have been great. The bun is nothing to write home about. The egg was perfectly done. The bacon was decent.\n\nNo condiments made the burger a bit dry, so I used the aioli and ketchup from my fries. The ketchup is \""meh\"" and really shouldn't be messed with. The aioli was good.\n\nLastly, the various burger concoctions on the menu leave something to be desired and are not al that imaginative. \""Euro burger\""???? Ever had a burger in Europe? Blech. Not only did I not have to make a tough decision, but there wasn't even one that jumped out at me as being \""OMG I have to have that\"".\n\nSo Burgr's burger is not a bad burger by any stretch, but for the money there are lots better burgers available. If you are a burger connoisseur then, really, skip this place and go to either:\n\n1) Burger Bar @ Mandalay Bay \n\nor\n\n2) Holsteins Shakes and Buns @ the Cosmopolitan.\n\nBoth offer far more satisfying burgers that were memorable, different, and deliciously satisfying. Leave Burgr to the less experienced, the more easily amused and go elsewhere."
1;Blah. Based on Yelp recommendations, stopped in here the other night for a quick dinner.  Not impressed...\n\nService was okay, servers were friendly (perhaps overly so - we were asked maybe six or seven times if things were ok). But, the food was bland and overly cheesy (all three of us agreed), pedestrian at best.  Our server got one of our orders wrong, didn't bring silverware when we asked him to. \n\nHonestly, nothing special. Won't come back here again.
2;good food, decent prices, fun atmosphere. it can be crowded! for pure sports event viewing, it would be better with all flat-screen HD sets, but you can't have everything I suppose.
2;Cheap chinese food. Best bang for buck as you get a lot of quantity for what you pay especially the rice dishes. But it must be really cheap as they give you unlimited rice.
0;Horrible experience. Super long wait. Got in at midnight, 2 people working... Line was not super long but it took 10 to 15 minutes per person! Will not use ever again!
1;"It was decent, but for the price and being in Vegas I will not stay there again. \nFor me I've stayed in nicer Vegas hotels for the same price.  \n\nNot in walking distance of anything worthwhile except for Circus-Circus (...only if you have kids and you want to take them to the arcade).  Oddly poor lighting and internet were annoying and noticed by everyone.\n\nTwo TVs and kitchen suites were nice laundry machine and dish washer in rooms.\n\nLOCATION: It is away from the quality casinos. and has the Circus-Circus, the Stratosphere nearby, and a few small crappy casinos, so it is not a busy area, or in walking distance of anything worthwhile. If you don't care about being 'on the strip', head south more and actually stay on the strip.\n\nWTF!?! CONS: sporadically working, slow internet and oddly dim lighting. \nRecently had a wedding with friends and family, and we stayed in multiparty rooms on different floors. 2 things stood out poor internet and lighting.  This 2 minor issues kinda sucked, otherwise I would give it 3 stars and maybe more if it wasn't in Vegas where the hotels really compete for affordable prices and quality. \nFelt like I was staying in The Shining's OVERLOOK Hotel with the weird overly dim lighting trying to get old  timey dial up to work at times.\n\nInternet is free; however it is fairly terrible, and sometimes seemingly unusable for phone or laptop. Everyone had issues trying to use the internet- no matter what floor or where they were in the building.  Also everyone had with dim lighting.  You never think of lighting or internet being an issue, until you are stuck somewhere. Anyhow seems like the hotel uses dim LED lights, that are either too low power or too old to cast much light.\n\nLOCATION: Circus Circus & Stratosphere. Need to take a cab or bus to get anywhere. Large building across the street has been under construction/abandoned since 2008, along with several other properties around this hotel in similar situations.  This is not \""On The Strip\"".\n\nThere's a pool bar with a menu and drinks, but there's no restaurant in this hotel. Seems like they're using this hotel specifically to coerce people into timeshares. although all we were offered was a continental breakfast, and a \""mystery prize\"" valued at supposedly $200 (possibly off of an airline ticket, that would be likely very difficult to use).  I don't know what the timeshare push is like and whether it is a hard or soft sell.\n\nOther observations: small gym, coffee-shop restaurant (bagel sandwiches), and  pool.\nPaid parking required everyday, but there is also valet, which can be less expensive if you take your vehicle out once or twice a day, and tip decently. Everyone had positive experience with the staff who seemed to be friendly."
3;New to Yelp, just moved back to the Phoenix area after living in CA for a few years. I went to Rusconi's today for lunch after reading about it and Chef Rusconi's history in the valley. The restaurant was very nice and clean, appealing to the eye and very warm and comfortable. The server explained to us that the chef had done all of the interior wood work himself. Great job! Service was good, menu was nice and simple and my burger and salad was great. $9 for a great burger and house salad.......good price for an upscale and comfortable dining experience. I'll definitely be back.
4;Favorite, favorite place to eat all you can eat sushi by far, and for so many reasons! I have become a regular here to the point where getting to my 10th stamp on my punch card is no longer a challenge. Not only does this place have wonderful and quick service but their sushi is always fresh. I would say the stars of their all you can eat menu is the appetizers and nigiri. I'm not a huge fan of rolls but they are tasty and worth trying here. But what I would highly recommend is the yummy yummy crispy tuna (spicy chunks of tuna on top of a round wonton crisp), spicy yellowtail handrolls (one of the best in town), and the yellowtail sashimi with jalape\u00f1os. They also serve uni (2 pieces per person) in AYCE and toro (1 piece per person). They also serve fresh oysters in their AYCE, prepared Japanese style with ponzu sauce, that my sister and her husband love. They have different desserts as well, other than just ice cream and they serve yummy different sakes. All of this and more is completely worth the price! Also, like everyone states, they play music videos on a big projection screen which is pretty cool. The server I like to order from is JAKE. He's always pleasant and checks up on you regularly.
4;This was my first Yelp event and I had a great time! Delicious food, great drinks, fun atmosphere... I met a lot of great people. Cannot wait to go to more Yelp events in the future. Great job Nikki and staff!
2;In general, I like Guidos.  They have a good selection of bottled beer, and it's reasonably priced.  I think their food is fine, I've taken my dad there before and we've definitely had worse meals in CU over the years.  Hell-- I even think that some of their martinis are better than those at Boltini-- blasphemy, right?  \n\nThe bartenders have always been very nice, but I had one interaction with a waitress that was less than ideal-- I ordered La Fin du Monde, she brought me Lindeman's Framboise, I pointed out the error (they're polar opposites of the bottled alcohol spectrum, I didn't want to pay $8 for raspberry stuff) and she made a comment about how it's not like they could give it to someone else.. trend in DT champaign? But, she did bring me the right beer after I questioned her initial decision.  \n\nOverall, I like going there to play pool on the quiet nights... on the weekends, I'd rather go somewhere else.
0;I ordered penne pasta with Alfredo sauce for pick up.  Not that I was expecting much because the service is always horrible, but the food is usually OK so its easy to look past poor service.  The Alfredo sauce had a layer of oil on top of it so much that I had to pour as much of it out as I could before eating it. Needless to say, I won't be returning.  The food is no longer worth the service. I'd rather drive the extra distance and go to Vit's pizza up the street where there is friendly service and quality food.
0;I would give them ZERO stars if it were an option. No one came to wait on us. I had to ask the hostess to send us a waiter. We'll call him Mr. Personality because he never did tell us his name. I should have known we were in trouble when he didn't bother to write down our order. My Caesar salad came without the requested onions. My grilled salmon was overcooked. The vegetables were bland. The waiter took away my half-empty glass of ginger ale and filled it with water. He never offered us dessert. The rest rooms were filthy. I would never recommend this place to anyone.
0;First of all let me start by saying I spent 900$ on an extension application done by Andrea and I feel it was a complete robbery and the salon did not stand behind their stylist and even try to fix it or mend our clearly broken relationship after spending 900$.  They made me feel as if 900$ was insignificant and my buisness and satisfaction meant nothing to them.  First of all the hair was over priced.  It comes from the hair shop in LA which you can order directly for almost 60$ cheaper per package along with free shipping, even overnight which of course they do not disclose to you.  The hair was keratip, and applied very very poorly.  There was about a half inch left between my scalp and the newly applied extensions, comparable to a month of growing out from past applications.  There was absolutely no order or technique, they were just placed sporadically including in my hair line which if you have ever worn extensions before you know it should be about two fingers away from your hairline all the way around to avoid seeing the bonds as well as extreme discomfort, breakage, and sores from the extremely tender area.  The hair was attached to pieces of my own hair too insignificant to carry the weight of the artificial hair and I lost somewhere between 10-15 bonds within two days with all my hair attatched to it.  These are mistakes someone who isn't trained in hair extensions would make, however Andrea not only claims to have been doing this for 15 plus years, she teaches the master extension stylist certification class to future extension stylist.  I don't even understand why she has a job at all.  I find it hard to believe she has not had other complaints because upon my first return to remove the bonds out of my hairline I saw a stylist named Jessica who was extremely pleasant and seemed much more skilled at this particular aspect of her job then Andrea informed me that she fixes a lot of Andreas messes and doesn't understand why she isn't given the client in the first place so it could be done right the first time.  She removed many uncomfortable bonds and apologized.  I went home, but it didn't stop all the breakage from the pieces that were attatched to insignificant amounts of hair.  Three days later I removed all the hair to prevent further damage to my natural hair which will take years to grow out from the scalp.  Beware!!!!!! DO NOT GET HAIR OR EXTENSIONS done by Andrea.  Also order the hair from hairpiece.com direct from the vendor and save lots of money.  Canyon falls is a RIP OFF
2;Cheapest go to spot for your source of hangover food!  \n\nI admit I use to go to this place a lot because it was probably the most affordable place on the strip to eat at. However, this place is old news for me now since I have the luxury of eating it at Downtown Disney now!   \n\nFood: I usually opt for the original sandwich or the full montagu. However, I personally prefer the original ! In addition to the sandwiches, I also enjoy eating their clam chowder here, because it definitely hits the spot after a crazy night of partying. \n\nService: The line is always long during the daytime, I feel like this place needs to learn how to be more efficient about this aspect of the business. But then again it may not be their fault, because everyone and their friends keep cutting the line! \n\nFinal Verdict: Love the sandwiches and soup, but I would probably only come back here if I was traveling on a budget.
4;OMG this place is sooo cute!!! By far the best coffee I've ever had, ask for a fredo cappuccino. The strawberry ice cream is my fav. The staff is so friendly and welcoming. I'm definitely coming back.
3;I like this place a lot and come here often. They always give a lot of cream cheese (my favorite part) and their bagels are big and fresh.  I typically get the onion or the blueberry bagel with plain cream cheese and it never fails to make my morning.  I've had the lox sandwich once too and it was really good, so I definitely recommend that as well.  Service is great and fast, great variety in bagels and sandwiches.
3;The staff was all smiles, steak was\nEXCELLENT, and overall wonderful experience. The sommelier  was exceptional, too.The only reason it has 4 instead of 5 stars was the lighting, which flickered low to high for several minutes around closing time.
3;Nice campus to visit. It's pretty big and I found it a little easy to get lost (it's very spread out) but not bad.
0;I came in with my best friend's sister to redo her hair from the day before. They had made her hair too red and were bringing it down to a dark brown burgundy. I'm assuming the woman in the office who spoke with my friend's mother and sister was who runs the school. She was very professional and was very apologetic. What turned me way off about this school was the presentation of it and the students and educators in charge. As soon as we walked in all of the students were sitting in their chairs texting and talking about inappropriate subjects. Not only were they rude and seemed annoyed by questions asked by me and her mother, but the students gave rude glares and whispering comments about me and other clients in the building... I know from experience what it was like to be a cosmetologist student. I've been licensed for about a year now and work in a salon as well. At my school we were held to a higher expectation so we were prepared to work in nicer salons. In my opinion, if you go to Avalon, the standards they set for their students set them up for failure. Not only are their techniques half assed, but the way they are taught to present themselves to clients is very unprofessional and trashy. I wouldn't trust anyone from this beauty school to touch my hair.
0;Not a happy stay. Shouldn't have opened hotel at all if still under construction. Went for a wedding (200+people) and woke up to noisy construction and construction workers inside still working. Bar was not even done, cheap setup in the corner. List of complaints from $5 coffee, which normally every hotel room there is complimentary coffee in all rooms. No ice available by vending machines, our fan in washroom did not work, refrigerator in room out of service. Just horrible. I feel that if someone is paying $200+/room the service and experience should be exceptional. And definitely not worth the $20/day car valet. There is nothing special about this hotel except that it's along the lake. Not worth the money. Never staying here again. Look elsewhere and think twice before staying here.
1;Nothing Special.  Just another ok Mexican place in Arizona.  Blah
2;This place is taking a bit of a beating, Eleanor is right. There are worse offenders in Edinburgh than this joint. The food is pretty good and not really that much more expensive than anywhere else.\n\nIgnoring the silly titles, the Hot Dogs and Burgers are great. Portions are a decent size and it tastes like it was cooked that day, which is always a bonus.\n\nStaff look a little tired, but what waiter doesn't.
0;"Who copied who? Did Quizno come before Potbelly - these two chains are exactly the same, lousy. Potbelly says they slice their sandwiches fresh, but the dude (who annoyingly called me and every other guy \""Boss') did not slice anything. He might have sliced it a week ago and then he just grabbed it and put in my sandwich. To top it off, the turkey is another low quality variety that is suitable for cow feed. Yeah, that's why the prices are so cheap - it was five bucks for the food and the turkey quality was masked because it looks like a wrap with alot of bread and toppings jammed inside. This is one time I was glad there wasn't alot of meat in my sandwich. College kids and construction workers will like this crap, but you ain't fooling the rest of the smart eaters in America, well maybe you are because of your snappy name and grand openings that require a PR agent, but never again for this guy. You also charge $3.50 for a tiny cup of soup. Bah Humbug."
4;We go here all the freaking time.  We can get dessert for a family of four for about $10, and everyone gets what they want.  I stick to the tart flavors, as all the other ones are too sweet for me.  Great, fresh fruit toppings.  My only complaint is that it gets a bit crowded.
0;2 sliders on a long huge plate for $8?  Ridiculous!  1 piece of thin meat that covered only 2/3 of slider sized bun...rip off!\n\nI won't be back!
4;Very good food 1st time there I will come back. The manager David was very attentive to us
2;"I was excited to stay at New York-New York for the first time ever, as it was one of the more noticeable theme hotels on the strip when I first visited Vegas.  Though, in an amazing location, this hotel it generally average, and some things just plain annoyed me.\nWe booked on Priceline, arriving to find that we were given a room with two queens, as there was no king option available....oh well. Our friends, who had already booked a king suite, were also denied.  I was further annoyed when I saw that my credit card had been charged a $349 deposit for our 3-night stay which would cover \""incidentals\"" and would be otherwise fully refunded.  Well, I have no idea which incidentals they were talking about, as we were refused when we tried to charge our poolside drinks to the room, stating that we had not arranged with the desk to do so.  Further, our room came without a fridge, and they tried to ask for $30 per night to rent one.  We refused, and they still gave us the fridge.  The maid service was fine, except that they called each day at 1:00 PM stating that they could not clean the room because the \""Do Not Disturb\"" sign was still on the door, which is fine, but a little early to decide they cannot clean the room at all. The final annoyance is that we constantly heard the roller coaster from the room, but it wasn't too loud.\nOn the bright side, our room overlooked the pool, which makes for a nice view.  As I said, the location is convenient, and there is a bakery downstairs right at the elevator, perfect for hangover breakfasts.  We checked in and out quickly and easily, and there was never much of a wait at the elevators.\nAll in all, it is not bad, but I'd prefer to pay a bit less and stay somewhere else, or a bit more and stay somewhere nicer."
4;Love this place! Always have the best service when I come here, it feels like a family run restaurant. Intimate ambiance with a modern look. The food is excellent, I always get the pad se ew and it never disappoints!
2;I went here today for something sweet for my co workers and I. The gelato here is amazing! I suggest trying it, however it will be pricey. $7 for a small cup. It was worth it. I tried the Spumoni, and the Mango flavor.  Ended up getting the Tiramisu, and my co worker got the Mango. A must try if you are going to the Palazzo. The staff is also super friendly and encourage you to try as many flavors as you want.
3;YUM I loved Beckett's Table. We were greeted by two friendly hosts, and chose to sit inside, but definitely plan on enjoying the weather on the patio next time. I was referred here by a friend who had went and raved about it.\n\nOur server was very helpful in recommending his favorites and helping me choose my dinner, the fire roasted green chile pork stew. Amazing! Definitely would order it again. We also split bacon cheddar biscuits which were very good.\n\nOverall I had a really enjoyable experience with both the service and the food and will absolutely be bringing friends back.
2;"Sky Harbor is A-OK.\n\nThis could change over time. It could become \""Meh, I've experienced better.\"" Or, it could become \""Yay! I'm a fan.\""\n\nI'm not holding out much hope, but if suddenly Light Rail puts a station at the end of my driveway with a non-stop to Terminal 4, then Sky Harbor becomes a \""Woohoo! As good as it gets!\"""
0;"I must preface this review by saying that I did not actually eat here. They would not let me. \n\nI had reservations for two at 6 pm. Our flight arrived in Vegas at 3:30. My friend, who was traveling with me, arrived without his bag. They said it would be around 10 that night before he got it. The big problem - my friend only had shorts. The restaurant had a \""no shorts\"" policy. I called the reservation line and asked if they would make an exception - NO. I went directly to the restaurant and asked if they would make an exception - NO. I understand policies. I have them in my business. My deal on policies is that, if circumstances dictate, I make exceptions. This is not the theory for Prime Steakhouse. At least for us, it wasn't. \n\nI saw many of the patrons of Prime later that night. I have to say I couldn't effectively gauge the dress code. There were hookers with body parts spilling out of all parts of their dresses (that's using the term \""dress\"" liberally). There were men in ripped jeans (which they said they had a policy against) but I guess when you pay $400 for ripped jeans, it doesn't count. Shorts are not okay but T-shirts are??? \n\nI wish I could tell you about Prime, but their inane adherence to selective policies prevents me."
3;I came across Acerno VIllas when I was looking for a place to live.  I searched a lot of places.  I took a tour of the apartment complex one afternoon while on my lunch break. I was taken back at how nice the complex was and there was even a nice 1 bedroom in my price range that overlooked the pool.\nThe apartments seemed great, on the up and up and the management seemed very responsive about maintenance requests etc.\nAs the one year mark approached my girlfriend and I started to notice and overall change in the complex.  Seemed to start seeing a lot of people wandering around, and using the pool who clearly didn't live here.\nThe general vibe of the place seemed to go  down hill from what we could tell, seemed as though they just started letting anyone move... perhaps due to the economy they just needed to fill the apartments.\nI still renewed my lease, only for 6 more months this time around due to work obligations.  Hoping that this place cleans up a little and they some how are able to monitor the real residents compared to the people just coming here to use our pool.
1;I wanted to give this place a single star, but the coffee was good enough that I felt guilty doing so. \n\nThat being said, this was by far the filthiest cafe I've ever seen. I literally changed tables 3 times before finding one that wasn't sticky or entirely covered with crumbs. There was food and trash scattered all over the floor (including a half scone laying forgotten near the entrance). There was only one other customer there besides myself, yet the employees stood behind the counter chatting instead of picking anything up. \n\nI came here to have some coffee and read my book, and ended up having to leave after finishing a single chapter because the hoards of flies buzzing around my croissant made it hard to concentrate on my reading. After swatting at one and noticing a veritable fly graveyard on the windowsill, I decided enough was enough and hit the road.\n\nThe coffee was actually quite good, but the atmosphere was miserable. If you do choose Barriques - get it to go.
0;I would actually love to give this place no stars but obviously I can't. I stayed at this hotel one time and that's all that did it for me. This hotel is randomly stupid. The slots are like whatever too. I stayed there for 3 nights. The first night I barely was in the room. The second night is where everything went down. I slept in the bed and woke up covered in blotches all over my body. They itched like crazy and I was finding myself looking for a CVS and trying to get rid of it rather than sitting by the pool having a good time. I later found out the hotel has a bed bug problem. My suitcase was on the bed half the time so I just threw the whole thing out including my clothes. I rushed to a doctor out here by my house and they said they go away on their own. I spent almost a month being tormented by it.
1;I just had my thrid meal here, the food is VERY good... \nI just don't know if i will go back... which sucks cause i like the food...\nso they have signs all over.... 1/2 price maragritas thursday with several brands of tequilla listed underneath that sign saying all are 1/2 off... so i ask for a patron margarita and he says just house is half off.................sign clearly states otherwise, i point this out and the waiter all of a sudden has a hard time understanding english??? Not cool for me.. i did not get a margy... and am sad i had a bad experience here.
4;As everyone else has mentioned, this place is a hidden gem. Have reservations about the shady shopping center? Put them aside! The food was amazing. I had the meat combo spicy fried rice (yes, i went to a Vietnamese restaurant and ordered fried rice, i wanted to try it) and it was amazingly tasty, addictive even. My wife had beef vermicelli, which she also loved and the small bite she let me have was quite tasty. Need your Asian fix but disappointed with Miyagi's in NoDa? Ya, me too, try Truc out.
3;I like the Brass Ring. Even though the ceilings are a ba-jillion feet tall, it feels cozy inside. The pool tables are challenging (they're HUGE) and the service is just attentive enough. On top of that they have decent food and really well crafted drinks. Hendrick's press with freshly muddled cucumber? Don't mind if I do.\nThis place is not cheap, so keep that in mind if you are on a budget. But it is a fun place to hang out with a small group and have a good time.
1;To provide context: We visited Don Miguel's at 9:40pm on a Friday. They close at 10:00pm, but the hostess seated us without letting us know this fact. However, the hostess continued to seat patrons up to 10pm, while our waitress told us that she needed to get our order in before 10pm. We appreciated the honesty of our waitress. \nThe decor is tacky, but for a Mexican place inside a casino, I would expect nothing less. \nWe started with margaritas, both strawberry, and both tasted like sugar, and we were not sure if there was any alcohol in the drinks. The salsa and bean dip served with the chips were the best part of the dinner. I ordered cheese enchiladas, my wife had the veggie burrito. The enchiladas were okay, very cheesy with a nice sauce. The rice was very bland, and the beans were decent. My wife's burrito was just roasted veggies in a tortilla with sauce, however, it was a different sauce than the green sauce on top of the burrito. She was not impressed by the burrito. \nThe portion sizes were large, and this is one of the few times we have Mexican and do not take home leftovers. \n\nIf you are looking to eat Mexican inside a casino, check out Guadalajara in Sunset Station and Boulder Station, or Willy & Jose's in Sams Town.
4;Best Gluten Free Pizza I have ever tasted.  The staff here is the sweetest too.    I usually just zip in for a pizza to go, but their entrees smell and look fab.  Definitely the place to check out in Mesa,AZ if you like Euro cuisine.
0;"I will try to be short and sweet so here goes...we arrived at 1:30pm on Sunday, September 14 for a table reserved months in advance.  We were a bit delayed but got seated in about 10 minutes.  After being seated, one of the managers (or servers?) came by and asked if we had reservations.  We said yes and told him that we checked in at the front and a girl brought us to the table.  He left and said he had to go confirm (like we were lying...).  A girl came back and asked the same thing; poor communication.  I get that the place is busy for Sunday football but there were a lot of staff walking around so organizing people into their seats shouldn't be an issue.\n\nAfter all this was sorted out, we waited almost another 20 minutes to even be acknowledged by the wait staff to put our order in.  We were told that we had to spend $600 to have the booth ($100/person); an absurd amount of food and beverages to consume in 3.5 hours.  The only way this could happen is to order all the most expensive things on the menu and drink a lot of top shelf liquor.  Are they suggesting we binge drink?  Because that's the only way we can consume that dollar amount.  We had a late night and just wanted to enjoy some good football, food and a couple beers.  \n\nWe ordered a few pizzas, some soft pretzels, wings and banana cream pie.  The pizza wasn't that great and the wings were fatty - not crispy.  The only highlight was the banana cream pie - best I have ever had but not worth the ridiculous amount we paid.  \n\nLet it be known that our $600 booth had ONE television that we couldn't even control ourselves.  We had to flag down a server to change it for us.  The view of the big screen was obstructed by the TV beside us.  For that money, we could have rented a cabana poolside, had our own TV to control, get much better views and the ability to go swimming.\n\nWe were then told we had to be gone by 5pm.  Factoring in about a 30 minute delay in getting our order in, we now had 3 hours to consume $600 worth of food and drink.  Impossible!  I believe the minimum order amount removes a lot of motivation from the wait staff.  We ended up not spending $75 and had tons of wasted food and drinks.  Very disappointing.\n\nAll in all, this was a terrible experience.  This is a poor concept compounded by mediocre food and huge minimums. A fail on so many levels - Emeril should be removing his name from this place, immediately."
3;I've been going here since I was a wee tot.  I have always enjoyed their food even though there's nothing too special about it.  I really like their breakfast menu.  You always seem to get lots of food for very little money, which is nice.  \n\nMy only complaint is that it is WAY TOO SMALL and always very busy.  They should really look at expanding the restaurant.
2;Last meal before leaving Vegas...\n\nSelf-seating. Takes awhile for the server to come greet, but I don't blame them with how disorganized this place is. However, our server was extremely friendly :)\n\nOrdered: \nChicken Fajita Burrito (minus the chicken and cheese) - was decent. Definitely not an authentic Mexican burrito... but it did it's job and made me full as can be.\n\n$11 beers... what the redonkulous? Only in Vegas...
1;Hard to believe a burger place with just a handful of people at 6:30 on a friday! We started with fried pickles and i swear about 12 to an order for about $6. Burgers seemed and tasted pretty basic for the price. The best part of the meal for myself was the cabbage slaw. We ordered the bottom burner and the morning after. Both tasted just Ok! Nothing really special stood out except the price! All in all two burgers, order or fries. Slaw and those pickles with water to drink was $50. I really think they missed the mark on what could be a great place!
2;Big View is so inconsistent. I've almost stopped going there completely. I used to go almost weekly, but each time, something was wrong with the order. This was cold, this was raw, this was wrong...it was just a joy when they actually got the order right. It's just not worth the effort anymore. Service is okay. The bakery items are all good, though.\n\nOriginal Review: I've been going to Big View with my family since it opened. The food can be excellent--but it can also be just average. It just depends on when you go. The diner just got a new menu, and it all seems very good. I get the patty melt (no onion), and it's delicious almost every time. The bakery is exceptional, everything I've tried I've liked. Service is midding to good, the latest time I went it was very good.
3;4 stars just for how this places looks.  4 stars for the prime rib.  4 stars for the proximity to my hotel room.  uhh.. their bad on the cheesy minipotatoes.  tasted like fart.  expensive, like all other places in bellagio.  pretty good though.  very nice servers.
1;The sofa section with the hookahs and the dance floor looked like something I wanted to partake in but the service was less than wonderful and the food was undercooked - I've had better.\n\nUnfortunately, most Middle Eastern restaurants that I have been to lack In the service department. We were the 2nd table in the Egyptian themed restaurant. About 10 min after us, a large group came in and the one server/bartender didn't seem to be able to cut it. We had an appetizer before we had even ordered our main meal. We were done with the appetizer before we even got a chance to get drinks or order our main meals. This meant that we were sitting with menus in our hands while eating the appetizer. It wouldn't have been a big deal but I really wanted to have a drink other than water as well.\n\n The appetizer we got was the Cleopatra platter for $15 and it had a lot of food with it! I think the best item on the platter was the Tabouleh but adding the meat to the hummus was also pretty tasty. For me, that's where the praise ends.\n\nThe service was poor due to being understaffed so I had to flag down someone when my Salmon Kabob came out RAW. The Shrimp Kabob was good but it was not an easy process to actually get to the meat. Even after the Salmon was replaced, no one bothered to even offer to discount any part of the meal. Overall, I am disappointed and will probably not go back.\n\nMeh. I've experienced better.
2;Yeah, they're closed.  Shock of the century.  Overpriced drinks and a pretentious menu that didn't live up to its vision.  For this neighborhood in general it was too ambitious.  The same restaurant downtown probably would have soared because Uptowners tend to ignore prices more.  But in Dilworth it's trying too hard.  Just be a pub!  People love pubs!
3;Good food, great atmosphere.  Enjoyed the visit and the good customer service.  They have an egg place card you can flip if you need anything, which is a great idea.  Coffee is a little weak.  4 stars great place for breakfast.  Plus I used their wifi to post this.
3;Food was good, portions were reasonable.  I would eat here again.
2;"I am going to add a star to my previous review from a few months ago.  I have indeed returned to Heart Attack Grill with visitors from out of town as I said I may in my first review.  The burger was good again. I passed on the fries this time.  What gives this place a boost this time around is the event I witnessed on my second visit.  This is not in reference to the patient who had an actual heart attack while dining.  To give that an extra star would be cruel and sick on my part.  No, my extra star comes on the wings of a public spanking of two patients by a rather sultry nurse.  These two finished, on their own, a burger larger than a single bypass burger.  One finished a double.  The other, a triple.  In response they were required to remove their wallet from the back pocket, bend over a chair and receive three spanks asking \""Please nurse, may I have another\"" in between each.  This caught the attention of not only the other diners but the people walking outside as well.  It was quite funny. Not to mention entertaining.  I hate to sound deranged by saying that public humiliation is something to be admired but this is Las Vegas.  Heart Attack Grill is bringing the \""sin\"" back to Sin City."
2;I've eaten here many times, multiple locations. Usually pretty good, but definitely not my favorite.  \n\nI had the $7.95 lunch special which included your choice of a lunch entree and a side...my choice was the traditional falafel sandwich with a Greek salad on the side. It was good. The hummus trio looked great, but wasn't as tasty. The best part of the meal was the baklava cheesecake.  \n\nThe bill came to $34 for two people for lunch. I know I'll be back, but I don't think I'll be a regular here.
0;Worst customer service I've ever dealt with.  My upgrade was available and I wanted to switch to the iPhone 4s.   He told me that not only is it on back order for two weeks but the apple store in the mall was flat out also and I had no reason to check there.   I not only got my phone at the apple store but they had no shortage of phones.
2;I don't come to this Walmart often, I usually go to the one in El Mirage. This one seems a lot more crowded, but I do my shopping here when I need to go to Desert Schools for something.
0;"Happened to stumble upon this place by accident and decided to go in.  It appears to be a traditional German bakery.  The girl behid the counter was very nice and conviced me to purchase a cake.  I decided to try the Black Forest Cake, which is a chocolate cake with layers of cream.  When I went to pay for it, I noticed they were going to put it in a bag.  I asked for a box because I wanted to place it in an ice chest to transport it home (it was 100 degrees outside) and I did not want it getting smashed or ruined.  A guy there, who appeared to be the owner, said no he will not put one item in a box because it costs too much.  I understand if I had bought some bread or items that are not \""delicate\"", but this was a layer cake.  I never heard of putting a piece of cake in a paper bag.  Needless to say, I said \""No thank you\"" and left the store without purchasing anything and I will not be back.  I also decided not to purchase other items that I was looking at.  It is sad that the owner lost a potential customer over properly prackaging a piece of cake so that it can be transported without falling apart or making a mess.   Too bad the women that was behind the counter is not the owner becasue she appeared to be a lot more customer oriented and a good sales person."
0;"Blonde moustaches do not count for \""free moustache ride movember\"".  Sorry my moustache is the wrong color."
2;I haven't been to Ross in years, but recently my friends and I were planning a trip to the US National Whitewater Center and needed to look for water shoes...sure enough, Ross had what we needed and for the cheap! Score!\n\nLike Bruce and Gary mentioned, the space is large which makes it look like everything was picked over or not replenished. Perhaps having more organized shelves or items lined in rows would help give it a different feel.\n\nAnyway, I found that it's a great store to stock up on items you'd want to take to the beach, but not pay huge prices to do so. They have swim wear in the $10s, a beach blanket for $15, and large towels around the same price. They have a variety of other things besides clothing too, like household items, body care, and even car mats. \n\nIf you're in the mood to browse, but don't have anything too specific in mind, make a quick stop here.
3;I was very happy when the first two Portilo's store locations opened up in Phoenix. I am a Chicagoland native who loves to share a great causal meal with friends at these restaurants.\n\nThe following will be borrowed from a previous location that I have reviewed. It will be several of my favorite foods from the menu. Enjoy! \n\nRoast Beef Sandwich. One of the best roast beefs in town. I would recommend getting it with mozzarella cheese, hot peppers, double dipped in gravy. It's a fantastic meal! For those with a serious appetite, try ordering the Big Beef. It's twice the sandwich for only a little more. \n\nJumbo Hotdog with everything on it. A Jumbo all beef hotdog with onion, relish, tomato, hot peppers, mustard, and a speared pickle. This is the epitome of the Chicago Hotdog! A must try! I recommend ordering two.\n\nFresh Chopped Salad. Ditalini pasta, crumbled bacon, romaine and iceberg lettuce, red cabbage, tomatoes, onion, gorgonzola cheese, chopped chicken, with a great blend of spices.\n\nNow a few things that I would stay clear of... The Cake Shake and the Malts. The Cake Shake take a piece of their famous chocolate cake and blends it with a chocolate shake. It is WAY too much chocolate for a desert. I would only order this if you have a serious sweet tooth. As for the Malts, they are seriously lacking with the malt power and you can get a better Malt elsewhere in town.
2;Now the Fairfield Inn and Suites. Totally redesigned and very nice. Didn't hear anything from the rooms connected to mine. A problem this place used to have. But don't get a room on the lower floors on the even side. I'm on the third floor and the music from downstairs is giving me a headache. Not sure if this is just a weekend problem or not.
3;I liked the Hash House A Go Go on Sahara, and recently we were staying at the M Resort and thought it would be nice to have it again.  This one is a bit smaller than the one on Sahara but the food was still pretty consistent.  Consistent as in HUGE!  The large portions are part of the charm at HHAGG.\n\nI like the food here at HHAGG and the servings, but the flavors can be a bit heavy.  It seems like almost everything I've tried there is pretty rich.  It's good, but sometimes you just want to have something that will give your taste buds some ZING or some ZAP!  Writing this review I am thinking something along the lines of a Thai Beef Salad.  Something bright, colorful, with some punch.\n\nThis round at HHAGG the food was still good.  I like those biscuits they bring out with honey, nice way to kill the diet guys!  Before I knew it I ate my biscuit PLUS half of my wife's one as well.  \n\nThe lady ended up getting The Kokomo Sandwich - it came with a thick hunk of meatloat, roasted tomato, and smoked mozzarella on thick Amish milk bread.  Verdict?  Very good!  A fatty sandwich indeed, when you could get your mouth around all the layers it was tasty.  The meatloaf itself was yummy and went well with the tomato and smoked mozzarella cheese.  It was even better when I added a dollop of ketchup to the sandwich.  After all, who eats meatloaf without that top ketchup/tomato sauce layer??\n\nI ended up getting one of Andy's Twisted Stuffed Burgers.  This thing is ginormous, no doubt!  It's two patties equaling one pound, and mine was stuffed with fresh mushrooms and Swiss cheese.  God I love me some mushrooms and Swiss cheese on a burger.  So massively stuffed, it comes to the table with a knife it in just to hold it upright!  It was great, just oozing with beefy juiciness in every bite.  Thankfully that burger wasn't dry!  The fresh lettuce, tomato, and onion helped to cut into all that fatness.\n\nNeedless to say, we definitely had leftovers for the trip back to our room.  Neither of us could finish more than half of our meals.  Of course at HHAGG this is usually the norm.  Heavy platters, heavy doggie bags on the way out.  If helped especially after I lost my @$$ gambling that night.  I thought lots of Asians hang out and play at the M?  Loosen those slots and tables!  All that losing made me hungry, and those leftovers fit the bill nicely!  Thankfully it didn't cost me any more money.
4;I came across this restaurant because I was actually interested in Mr. Charlie Palmer's other restaurant, Aureole, at the Mandalay Bay after seeing him guest judge on TOP CHEF, where he gave the challenge of pairing pinot and pigs for one of his annual events.\n\nI noticed that Charlie Palmer Steak was having a summer promotion, 3 course dinner + unlimited wine pairing for $48.00.  Every week, they have a new cut of meat.  I made the dinner reservations for a party of 5 about a  week in advance and on the night of the feast, I'm proud to say we were all blown away!  The ambiance was modern but with a twist.  Dim candle lit room for a romantic unforgettable moment type of vibe but well balanced with the dark wood for a touch of masculinity.  \n\nWe were sat promptly after checking in.  Every girl had a waiter to help pull out our chairs.  We were served bottled Fiji water and had deliciously warmed varieties of breads.  There were cornbread, sourdough, french, and wheat rolls.  I loved how when someone from  our table got up, a waiter would come and fetch our current table napkin and replace it completely with a brand new one.  No empty water or wine glass.  Every time it started to get low, there was an immediate refill.  They're so Ninja!  \n\nWe started of which their cheese platter.  It had 3 different types of cheese that I cannot remember but it was served with seedless sliced red grapes and bits of honey comb.  I loved the sweetness of the honey it played on the cheese.  It was accompanied by warm and fluffy brioche.  For our 3 course dinner, we started off with a watermelon salad.  It had a mild goat milk cheese and a balsamic dressing.  It was light and refreshing.  Our meat of the week was a grill New York steak.  It was cooked to perfection.  No one had any complaints about their steaks.  For the sides, it was served family styled.  We had grilled baby asparagus and oven roasted fingerling potatoes.  It was a satisfying meal.  On top of that, we had the most knowledgable and nice sommelier.  He was very generous with each and every pouring.  He also took the time to walk around the table to give us a breif description of each wine.  I think our table alone, help finished a couple of bottles.  For our last course, we had a chocolate covered hazelnut creme.  On the side, they threw in homemade chocolate chip cookie ice cream sandwiches for us.  I felt soo special that night.\n\nEverything about this place, from the food to the service and the decor has definitely surpassed my expections.  It's no wonder Charlie Palmer is who he is with soo many great accolades.  He deserves it and I'm just happy to have tried his food.
4;5+++++++++++++ stars....Best show that I ever saw.  If you close your eyes, you think that Travis Cloer IS Frankie Valli.  Scene Stealer Deven May was AMAZING at Tommy DeVito and Peter Saide made an awesome addition to the cast as Bob Gaudio. I sang, I laughed, I cried.  This is the must - see in Vegas.  \n\nThe venue was perfect without an obstructed seat in the house.  (We were in the 2nd row on the stage left side - and while we had to lift our heads up a little bit, it wasn't bothersome) The props and the sound was perfect.  \n\nAnd it was super awesome that I met the actors afterwards.  Super sweet guys and took the time to talk to their fans.
4;Whenever I am entertaining out of town guests, this is always a must hit lunch spot, and I'm at the point now where I've count of how many times I've eaten here.  \n\nThe service is always fantastic, I've never had to wait, and the food is consistently great, along with a number of the specialty cocktails that I've tried.  The club sandwich for lunch is incredible and one of my favorites, along with the gnocchi bolognese (thank god they made this a regular menu item, because it is truly outstanding).  Most recently, I had the chicken milanese, which was on par with the best chicken or pork milanese I've had.  \n\nThis place is always fantastic, but I would recommend this as a lunch stop over dinner, usually because it's less crowded and a bit more laid back - the food here also tends to be on the lighter side, so it's before before you head out for a long, hot day walking in the Vegas sun.
2;Located within the O'Aces bar behind the hospital. We've been there once for sit-down and once for pick-up. The bar atmosphere is nice, but the restaurant area is way too big for their location and service staff. Waitress forgot some of our order and we didn't get our appetizers. However, for the price, its not too bad but nothing to write home about.
0;"I love dancing! It's been a while since I've gone out and where I've been out in Arizona. My friend and I planned our annual Scottsdale dance night and this year the best night for us ended up on Wednesday. \n\nI could tell it had been a LONG time since I've done the club scene since most of my old stomping ground was either permanently closed, getting remodeled, or just closed on \""hump day.\"" Myst was the only club open in the Old Town Scottsdale area. When we got there, they told us that it was 18 and up on Wednesday nights and that people don't really show up until 11:30pm. It's also a $10 cover. Also, if you check your coat it's an additional $5. The 21 and older crowd can go upstairs and get drinks. \n\nThe dance floor is a pretty good size; however,  the music wasn't the best and seemed like the same thing over and over. I like current songs that you can occasionally sing along to and I think there was maybe one by Beyonce. \n\nThe crowd was young and many were all over each other. It made me embarrassed for some of the women there and then disappointed in the men for trying to handle women inappropriately. It is unusual for me to leave a club early and to not dance, but this was just not a good vibe or crowd. Whatever happened to dress nicely? Many of the guys just showed up in jeans and a flannel shirt. Seriously. The club looked warn and not kept up (e.g., holes in walls, could use a new paint job in the bathrooms, and not all the lights were on). \n\nDancing is fun, but not for me at Myst. Maybe it's the economy, but Myst has seen its better days and it's going to take a lot to get back to that."
4;Was back here again!! This is the best place for Thai.. Love the food and the service :)
2;This is a semi gracefully aging lady. You must insist that this 5 star hotel be 5 star. Call for bathrobes and slippers and some amenities or you won't get them. Ask for sheet change , etc. The valet parking at the main entrance is atrocious as is the parking at the North entrance. Location is great and the poker room is among the best. Buffet mediocre,coffee shop slow but good food and a counter. Look carefully atthe crap tables and roulette wheel. They are truly works of art.
4;I figured it was time for an update...to report on the consistently high quality of service, food, and ambiance delivered by the folks here.\n\nMy most frequent form of visit is to treat myself to an occasional work lunch, usually eaten in the bar area, and do some reading.  I have always received friendly, warm, and attentive service from the folks.  It's a really nice refreshing escape from a stressful workday....my menu/food selections vary but, some of my favorites are the Tuna Rolls, green chili, spicy peanut stew, Reuben, or the fallafal.  But, be still my beating heart...I've ignored the menu too long...and failed to notice/forgot about the meatloaf....until.....\n\nand it was SO YUMMY on such a cold day....a very generous slab of meatloaf, first baked, then heated on the grill....a generous serving or baby red mashed potatoes, green beans, and a mountain of onion strings....who knew you could get all four food groups in such a delicious package...meat, vegetable, carbs, and deep fried :)\n\nHUGE portion....I have left overs\n\nhint:  If you do come in a group, at lunch time, expect to wait, especially on Thursday or Friday....come a little earlier, and consider sitting in the bar.  Also, check the upstairs bad...it's a little different but, same great menu and service!
0;Im a sushi fanactic. Tonight was the first time i ate here. This sushi restaurant didnt seem to suprise me. The service was sad. The girl had ignore me and walked away  when i went up to the register and try to pay. The food doesnt taste like how they appear. The salad is full of watered down veggies. The sushi is rolled loosely so it would look big. Not one of the best but is the worst. Never again will i come here for dinner. Yama sushi on maryland prky and flamingo is good. Sushi Mon on Sahara is awesome. Ra at the fashion show mall is also delicious!!! :)
4;Ok so I'm a huge fan of Yelp, but I've never written a review... Why? I don't know, maybe I'd rather read reviews than write them, or maybe it's just pure laziness... \n\nAnyway, I'm finally ready to pop my yelp cherry and write my first review! Here it goes:\n\nMy hubby and I are in town for the weekend and one thing that I love about Vegas other than partying, is the FOOD! There are so many great eats out here it's ridiculous. Anyway, he wanted to take me out to a nice steak dinner for mothers day and the reviews here were awesome so we gave it a shot\n\nWe got the tomahawk long bone 32oz ribeye and split it. It just Melts in your mouth! We also split the Lobster Mac n cheese and it was another hit! Not too heavy but nice and creamy... Love love love it! \n\nOur server Liz was beyond awesome and the manager(totally forgot her name) stopped by our table to chat w/us and gave us a huge slice of their incredible lemon cake complimentary for mamas day. I've never had service that good!\n\nDefinitely coming back on our next visit!
0;I honestly don't know why I keep coming here (other than it being close to work) The service is terrible and they never have enough people working. There is no reason a smoothie should take 20 minutes to make.
4;Love this place! I recently found several one of a kind items here for my contemporary/rustic remodel. One of my favorite items purchased was an old green door that I converted into a computer desk. The little old man that works behind the counter is very nice and always willing to carry my items purchased out to my car. Stock changes about one a week so if you like digging for treasures this is the place for you!
2;When the Paris casino first opened, I went to this buffet and thought everything was superb. But over the years, the quality of the place has downgraded. I went back in December and was disappointed that they didn't have as much variety of food as I had remembered. The grilled chicken was dry and wish they had more vegetable dishes.  However, their frozen yogurt was probably their best. I went back for seconds.
3;Had a blast at the tables! Dealers were fun and we won! Would go back next time in Vegas!
3;I heart M&M's!!!! Wow, what an interesting place. I had no idea so much M&M merchandise was available. But, I should've known. This is America after all and we'll market and purchase anything and everything, right. Especially when we are tourists!\n\nI was able to resist pretty much everything in the 3 or 4 floors of this shop. I have no idea how they could fill that much space with merchandise emblazoned with M&M craziness but they can. \n\nThe only thing I could not resist were the little darlings themselves in all of their colorful, chocolaty goodness. The wall o' M&M's! Way overpriced ($9 a pound), but heck it's Vegas! I bought some anyway in lots of fun colors that don't come in the packages in the stores. Yes, they still tasted exactly the same. But, they were really, really pretty! It's a girl thing.
0;The worst place I have ever been. The service was horrible and the food was even worse. If u are someone who values customer service this isnt the place for you.
2;"Went to Pure on a Thursday night and only the outdoor patio portion was open.  We got a table with an amazing view overlooking the Strip.  The crowd was pretty chill.  If you're looking for that \""Vegas\"" club experience on a Thursday night, don't go to Pure.  However, if you're looking for a chill clubbing night, Pure works.  Regardless of the chill environment, my friends and I still had a great time."
4;Loved the atmosphere. Right across from chase field. The pretzel and provolone and shrimp appetizers were plentiful and fantastic. Easily enough for four people to share. The crab stuffed chicken was excellent and I was a fan of the kilt lifter beer. We also got the hot chocolate cake and the salted caramel pudding. Both lasted about one minute.  Rachel was fantastic!
3;Burritos are very good and enchilada style is included, but the line is often slow and long and the prices are a bit high.  Works as an occasional break from Chipotle, but runs about $4 more for a family of 4.
2;No reason to write very much here. It's frozen yogurt, nothing special. It's tasty but since it's on the strip it's overpriced, more than usual, which knocks a star off.
2;I don't know what it is about Eteaket that didn't WOW me.  I mean, it's clean and has a great list of teas but, I don't know, something was missing.  Maybe it had to do with feeling like I was in a chain.  Something about the colouring ... I don't know, in my head tea rooms should be a bit like pubs - warm, inviting, kind of funky.  Eteaket didn't really tick any of those boxes for me.\n\nMy tea (green Earl Gray) was quite nice, as was the box of creme caramel rooibos that I bought on the rave recommendation of Cressida F.  A bit pricey though - over a tenner for two pots of tea and a box to take away?  That's not too bank account friendly.\n\nAll in all it's nice, but doesn't quite give me the tingling feeling that I was hoping for.  Maybe next time I'll just opt to buy a box for home.
0;I for one have a general dislike for ALL circle K's! Everyone I have ever been to including this one has been filthy, with people full of tattoos and piercings and bandaids covering up their hickeys working there.I have nothing against tattoos or piercings but , come on you are working cover that up! It always takes forever and their customer service sucks! Circle K you need to make some major changes if you want your company not to be overrun by the more customer oriented convenience stores!
1;"we went to cure after it first opened & weren't that impressed. since it had been a while, &, since they've had so many accolades, we figured, give it a second try.\ni made reservations for 6:30. the place was PACKED to capacity when we arrived. the was not a table for us. we were told to go down the street to the allegheny wine bar, it'd be about 30 mins., they'd call us when our table was ready. 50 mins. later, we were told to come back. why take reservations if i still have to wait an hour??? this time there were at least a few empty tables.\nwe didn't even get our coats off, & the waitress was there, tossing the menus on the table, & then she was gone. when she finally came back, she asked if we knew what we wanted. not hello, good evening. not would you like something to drink, or here are the specials. just wadda ya want?\nthey used to be byob. they still are, but now they have a \""bar\"" as well-4 stools in front of 4-5 foot long top, with 1 side up against the wall. basically, if you're skinny, you'll be ok sitting there. if you're like a normal person, well, you may have to hold on for dear life if you're on the end. as a red wino, i found the selection limited.\nwe ordered the large salumi, beef tartare & the pork belly confit. when they came to the table, we were looking for more! the food was good, not exceptional. & there just wasn't enough. when we asked the waitress if we could have the crab fondue made without the grapefruit because of med interaction, she quickly told us no, there was no way to take it out. so much for more food. we got dessert-i got the chocolate souffl\u00e9, tom the cr\u00e8me brulee. as dessert lovers, we were not impressed. i felt the pistachio cream was too much for the souffl\u00e9.\nwe left still hungry. actually stopped on the way home & got some burgers! we won't go back a third time."
0;Usually Mexican food served out of an outdated building with numerous building code violations is always the best. Not so much in the case of Carolina's. I arrived on a Saturday about 11 am to a short line and I had heard from one longtime Phoenix resident that this is the real deal. I had to try the famous tortillas right? So, I ordered up a cheese quesadilla and a red machaca burrito. How does it end up that Arizona and Nevada have completly different ideas of what machaca is. It is supposed to be dry beef grilled with onions, peppers, tomatoes and eggs. But in Phoenix, it is basically shredded wet beef doused in red or green sauce. Regardless, the Carolina's version was miserable. It was mushy and tasteless and since the thin tortillas could not hold all that beef inside, it turned into a knife and fork thing. I barely ate three bites of the mess and some fat was also discovered lurking in that meat.  Not good.\nSame thing with the quesadilla. Due to the tortilla being so thin, the cheese overwhelmed the item turning it into a cheese wafer. If I want Machaca, I'm heading back to Nevada next time to a state that knows the true definition of the dish.
3;Good staff, great drinks, good BBQ.
1;"Mr. Hunan why did you have to fail me? Were to begin. The office I work in has been ordering delivery from Mr. Hunan for years, but the last couple of times we have ordered it has taken forever, not just longer than normal, more like one & a half hours for delivery. I'm sorry if I order lunch at 11:00, I'm not expecting to eat it 12:30 and if it's going to take that long please don't tell me it will be there in a half hour, and to make matters worse we try to call and there isn't any answer...at all...for like 30 minutes calling every 10 seconds..... Anyway, we order 4 lunch specials for delivery on a Thursday afternoon for a co-workers birthday. I ordered the Chicken Lo Mein, big mistake. The chicken was cut in paper thin pieces, but that wasn't the problem. The problem was the chicken and noodles had absolutely no flavor. It tasted like boiled noodles and chicken..meh. The rice was fresh but again not a whole lot of flavor! The birthday girls Sesame Chicken was all breading and the egg roll looked like it had been re-fried. Another co-worker had the bourbon chicken, she said her's was just \""ok\"" and the fourth had Cashew Chicken, again just \""ok\"". Mr. Hunan was always our go to place for chinese but after being let down on food and service we probably are going to scratch it from our list."
2;Sunday Brunch the food was fabulous, but they had live singers with a keyboard and drums, way too loud for the space, and the keyboardist didn't know how to sing on key...   Just a thought.
4;This place is amazing.  The service is GREAT, I never had less than a half full glass of water.  I am a vegetarian, and the three other people I dined with are not, and for the pumpkin appetizer, they put the meat in a separate dish for the meat eaters.\n\nIt's just nice.  The place oozes kindness and helpfulness.  I'm not sure if the food is authentic, but it is really REALLY good and the service is so kind and helpful.
2;Decent GC, just like the others I suppose.  Went into the Platinum room and looked at a $24K Telecaster...don't see that every day.  Friendly staff offered to plug in guitars for me multiple times.
4;Best craft beer joint in Phoenix! No one else is brewing beer as imaginative as this! \n\nThe 4 Leaf Irish Red is surprisingly refreshing. I loved the Dark Knight Porter - and not just because of the Batman reference. \n\nBut it was the seasonals that blew me away - especially the black IPA. (And who else in Phoenix is brewing a Cascadian dark ale, by the way?) \n\nThe food options are limited but it is a working brewery after all. \n\nBottom line: If you wanna taste some truly great beer, this is the place to go.
4;Big elvis was a lotta fun.  And I am not even an elvis fan!  It was a great show.  You have to get there early in order to get a seat.  Oh and dont forget about the one dollar margaritas!
2;interesting
0;"If I could give this place negative stars, I would.\nI am a Las Vegas local and I deal with a lot of incompetent employees all the time, but this was hair that broke the camel's back. I just had to finally sign up to yelp to post a review about this place and the way one employee in particular has been dealing with customers.\n\nToday I went there to sell a pair of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles skis because I could not find anything about them online and I thought that Gold and Silver actually cared about having items that were RARE and COLLECTIBLE. \n\nUpon first arriving at the counter I was greeted by a guy named Javier who was very pleasant. Next I am bombarded with attitude from an employee named Preston over the item I brought in. Preston is an average looking, young-ish dude with a blonde buzz-cut and a chip on his shoulder.\n\nIt is pretty unbelievable that a shop that apparently deals with all kinds of historic and valuable items has an employee working for them that DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YEAR THE NINJA TURTLE WERE CREATED!!! \n\nSeriously, this guy was arguing with myself and 2 of his colleges saying that they were created 30 or 40 years ago! Aside from that fact, the entire time he was arguing and saying to one female employee \""Look it up then.\"", he kept repeatedly picking up the ringing phone and hanging it up intentionally to avoid the calls. \n\nHe also insisted that my skis were fake, which they most certainly were not. After \""Mr. Know it All\"" finally looked up when the Ninja Turtles were started and that he was wrong, he walked away in childish defeat.\n\nI was then able to finish talking to Javier about my skis and how awesome they were. He was unable to find anything about them online, so he said he couldn't make an offer and I left.\n\nThis is not the first time I have dealt with Preston and his attitude. \n\nAbout 2 months ago, my boyfriend and I took a few vintage lunch boxes into Gold and Silver to sell and were met with the same pompous and rude attitude from him.\n\nIt was the exact same situation where we were being helped by Javier and Preston decides to be disagreeable for no reason. While Javier was looking up the lunch boxes for us, Preston was standing behind him looking over his shoulder commenting on the prices they were seeing on the screen. \n\nJavier turned the screen to show my boyfriend and I what they were selling for online and we saw between $14-$20 for the one he was looking up. Javier then turned to Preston and said \""So $10 then\"" to which he replied \""They are only selling for $10\"". \n\nIt is obvious now that Preston is an idiot and didn't realize that we weren't blind and could see the prices on the screen. My boyfriend then pointed at 2 on the screen and told him that they were both going for more. \n\nTo which Preston replied \""no, they are going for $10\"". My boyfriend then asked him \""So will you give me $10 for that one?\"" and Preston said with a RIDICULOUS ATTITUDE \""No. WE..DO NOT..want any of YOUR STUFF\"". This was after Javier had only looked up one of the lunch boxes and Preston was not happy that his word was being questioned. \n\nMy boyfriend told him he was abrupt and he said back, \""It doesn't matter. You don't need to be asking the same question a million times\"". \n\nNext thing you know, My boyfriend and I are having security called on us because a disgruntled employee on a power trip doesn't know how to deal with human beings that are smarter than him.\n\nThis guy thinks he knows everything about every item that walks through the door and HE DOESN'T KNOW A DAMN THING!! \n\nIf you dare to argue with him, he will have you thrown out of the shop!\n\nPreston is repeatedly rude to customers I am convinced he is losing Gold and Silver Pawn LOTS OF MONEY AND CUSTOMERS.\n\nI am really hoping this review does not get passed up by managment and someone has a LOOOOONG talk with Preston about how OBNOXIOUS he is.\n\nAlso, Javier should be given a raise for having to deal with him all day,"
2;Great sushi joint.  Clean, fresh, tasty fish.
2;The reason for me coming here.....the how now brown cow...was the least impressive part of the meal. I got the $64 wagyu rib eye...and that did not taste like wagyu beef at all....the wagyu I had at Craftsteak last year was way more tender and delicious. The add on of bone marrow was lame also...hardly any for $15. The spinach souffle side was good, the tuna poopers....I mean, poppers...were good, the beignets and creme brulee for dessert were...good....getting the idea here?....everything was alright, not outstanding. Oh, and the duck fat fries were good too. Again, not as great a I thought they would be. The focaccia was way too greasy. service and atmosphere were great, but when those things overshadow the food..not a good thing. There are too many other steak places to try in Vegas to warrant returning here. Then again, I might just as well go back to Craftsteak.
1;"Okay, so I'm not gonna \""review\"" this Sonic. I mean, it's a Sonic. It is what it is. For fast food it's  okay, and they have a bigger variety of menu items compared to other fast food places, which is nice, but there's one think that irks me about THIS Sonic (when I would probably give most of them 3 stars)...they don't have an area where you drive up, park, place your order, and have someone deliver your food (and IIRC, occasionally by roller skates)! It's either drive-thru or walk-in, like any other fast food place!\n\nTo me, the whole drive-up & park is Sonics \""thing.\"" It's what sets them apart from other fast food places (okay besides the hot dogs, whatever that frito/cheese thing is, the sandwiches on toast, as well a gazillion types of drinks). \n\nSorry (this) Sonic, but I've experienced better."
3;TLDR: cakes and goods can be a little pricey. Food generally good. Front of house staff pleasant, customer restrooms available\n\nCake World Bakery is owned by a pleasant man who says he works 7 days a week every day and I believe it. He has a caring personality and works hard to maintain his business. Upon entry, you can see all the cakes that are traditionally purchased for Three Kings which happens to be celebrated today. \n\nEverything from the cake except the sliced candies is made at the bakery. And the small baby Jesus figurines. It was selling like hotcakes so it must be good. The bakery does sell other things as well such as sandwiches and sodas, but these are a la carte items that aren't usually purchased by guests that frequent the bakery. For a bakery, it looks very clean. If you peek your head into the back, the floors are pretty maintained so kudos to them for that. \n\nI would give it 4 stars. :]
0;Wow... not going back.   The person behind the counter, that made our coffee (the term barista intentionally left out) treated me like I owed her something. I approached and ordered  nicely enough but treated as if I had interrupted her from standing around,.  When I turned to ask my wife what she wanted I thought the server was going to have a fit.  At that point we should have just left but really wanted a cup of coffee.  Needless to say it was almost as bad as the server.  We Used to like this place but will have to find someplace else to get coffee downtown.
4;A must do Pittsburgh tourist attraction. One of two inclines left on Mt. Washington out of seventeen. Very cool experience from the history of this great city. \nInexpensive at a $2.75 a round trip. You pay at the top station, exact change only however, there are change machines available at both stations. A return ticket back is good for three hours which is more than enough time to explore the areas with in walking distance of both the top and bottom stations. Of which there is no shortage of things to do, there are river tours at the lower end and a very cool neighborhood at the top with ice cream, coffee shops, bars, restaurants, and Packs and Dogs (a must visit for the best beer selection in the area!). \nThe fact there are only conductors at the top station creates problems with people being rude, not knowing how things work, those things. Best solution? come at off peak hours when there is less traffic and enjoy a car to yourself :-)
0;Went down to try this restaurant. Waited 15 minutes for service in an empty restaurant while the servers were bussing their tables. Finally got service and cold bread, waitress blamed the slow service on it being busy when the place was deserted. We decided to leave and try our luck elsewhere.
0;Not impressed. Noodles were bland. Food was too expensive for what it was.  House chow mein was not very good. Cuttle fish ball soup didn't have much flavor. Overrated.
1;A staple of Mill Ave. for years, Slices is the place to go when it's 2am, the bar has kicked you out, and you're still too drunk off of cheap well vodka to drive (or stumble) home just yet. Expect a crowd of like minded individuals, all of whom are hungry, and most of whom are at least a little beligerant. There's always potential for a couple dbags to get into a fight, so there may be some entertainment provided. Great for people watching, but unfortunately their pizza is pretty weak. Thin slices that sit out for way too long, only to be briefly reheated and served up slightly stale, usually very greasy. They do have some great toppings, their chicken has always proved pretty decent, and as a few other mentioned, they've got a good pesto option as well. All in all though, even when I am drunk here at 2am, I find the overall quality of the food to be sub-par. As for the service, well, if you had to deal with as many obnoxious, drunk college students as these guys did, you'd be in a hurry to rush as many assholes out the door as possible too.
4;This was a really awesome event! My HUGE 18oz Ribeye was cooked perfectly med-rare and served with the best Potato and Leek Au Gratin I've ever had. The appetizers were all delicious but the big surprise for me was the Pretzel Sticks- seriously incredible! I am not a pretzel person so I almost skipped them but I could have easily scarfed down the entire basket...mmm delicious. I also really liked the Corn Fritters .. Wild West Shrimp...Blue Ridge Wedge salad...Pumpkin Spice Lava Cake ...Okay, pretty much everything! \n\nThe service was extremely attentive and knowledgeable. You can tell that everyone had a lot of passion for not only what they do, but for the Longhorn brand. The restaurant itself was kept up very well and they managed to take the cookie-cutter chain feel out of the equation. I was VERY impressed by the entire experience and  will definitely return.  \n\nIt was also wonderful getting to know more Yelp Elites. I love these small events because they kind of force you out of your +1 comfort zone, but you always leave feeling like you've made new friends and bonded over the experience. I completely credit  Nikki for creating that vibe and putting so much thought into producing stellar events-you're very much appreciated! \n\nA BIG thank you to our CM Nikki,  the fabulous Tonya P of Poprock, and the awesome folks at Longhorn : )
3;I've eaten here at least 70 times over the years.  Its food is consistently very good, and it certainly is not cookie cutter or formulaic.  They may try too hard to be unique at times, but they almost always get it right.  The wine list is the most amazing in Arizona, but I wish they organized it by varietal or region so you can navigate it better.
2;"Had a whole-wheat pancake with double servings each of blueberries and glazed pecans here two Tuesdays ago (Tuesdays are double-stamp days at the Dobson location).  Nice-sized pancake- its diameter was the size of the plate, which is the usual.  Wish I could say the same of this week's visit at the Central Ave. location (this past Monday; please refer to my review and photos).  I also ordered an Isle of Capri omelette for my lunch later that day.  Good portion (the platter included an English muffin and country potatoes) which easily feeds two.  Would've included a photo, but I didn't think it looked great folded in a styrofoam box...  Don't let the scent of feta and olives turn you off from trying it.  It is delicious!"
4;Wow - Does the food here taste amazing! So fresh and the flavours are amazing! I'd go again and again!
3;Excellent breakfast and lunch... Traditional American style.  Friendly waitress too.  Recommended.
3;What a great find!  I live close by and decided to stop in for lunch.  The Chicken Walnut Salad sandwich was incredible...very tasty.  Huge sandwich!  The Ahi Tuna Salad was delightful, with a yummy miso vinaigrette and crunchy wasabi peas.  I will definitely go back to try dinner!
4;We started to use Bark Avenue since it was right next door to our Vet. We have our Australian Shepherds shaved during the hotter months and Kristen has always done a great job. Also the price is very fair and the service is prompt. \n\nI can't recommend her highly enough.
0;Had the breakfast platter. Food was edible but I can't say it was good. I just covered it all in ketchup cause I was hungry. \n\nFor 2 people to have breakfast platter, 1 coffee, & 1 juice, total was $29.\n\nTook 20 minutes to get check after we'd finished eating.\n\nTook another 30 minutes to get someone to charge the card so we could leave!\n\nDon't stop here if you're in ANY type of hurry!
3;Great neighborhood burger place. Burgers always taste fresh and juicy. Fries and onion rings are both delish. Patio is a great plus on nights that have good weather.
1;Not what I expected. Ugh, these deceiving Yelp reviews...!\n\nEarl looks like a Quiznos and tastes only slightly better. Yes, it's open 24 hours but hello, this is Las Vegas. There are much better food options at even the most obscure hours. \n\nRoast beef sandwich: It's good, but most things taste good at 5 AM. It's reasonably priced, but that's because it's small. And at 5am I want a feast, not a three bite appetizer. Again, this is Vegas, the official home of gluttony, so Earl, please step it up a notch!\n\nThe clientele was somewhat depressing at 5 AM, but it's safe to assume that most Vegas establishments are depressing at 5 AM.\n\nNext bender, I'm going to Secret Pizza instead.
3;I really wanted to give 4 1/2 stars.  We've been there twice and it seemed so close to the perfect experience.  The food is outstanding.  The ambiance upstairs is warm and cosmopolitan, downstairs is meh. Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e is exceptional.
1;ENVIRONMENT - A more upscale Mexican restaurant. Great for a nice date night!\n\nSERVICE - Very friendly and helpful\n\nFOOD - Overall, i thought it was a bit too pricey for what we had. I'm not an expert on mexican food and don't have it often, but here's what i thought.\n+ Carne tampiquena $18 - steak, rice, guac, and refried beans. Again it was okay... Nothing special..I actually prefer the striploin at other places, maybe mexican just isn't my thing.\n\n+ camaron al mojo - $25. I dont think this was worth it. It came with 4 shrimps which weren't that flavourful. There was also salad, corn, and rice, along with some garlicy bread. Not worth $25.... It didn't impress me.\n\n+ queso fundido $6 - this was an appetizer. I mainly got this cause it has nopales (CACTUS!!).. It's my first time travelling out west sooo yeah. This was maiinly just mushrooms and cactus cooked in melted cheese which you put in soft tortillas. The nopales just taste like green peppers, and the dish was just okay. \n\n+ margarita $6 - strong! But mm drink,\n\nDon't forget to check in to claim your dessert! They gave us 3 types of desserts to choose from. We got the chocolate flam which was pretty decent. Soft and spongey.\n\nBut i'd probably wouldn't come back.
3;The Cheesesteak is the best in Vegas.  Outdoor seating only.  Go when the weather is nice.
1;Pretty good food, but crappy service.  This was our first time here, so we ordered waters with a few food items to test the waters...  The bartender took our order and we never saw him again.  We couldn't even order any cocktails or more food, which is a shame because it was really tasty.  We had to suck on ice cubes to soothe or tonnes from the spicy food.  Not a good first impression for a new restaurant.
3;Iv been here several times it's a great place for a date. \n\nNEVER WOULD I EVER BRING A GUEST HERE FOR A BUSINESS DINNER. \n\nThe main room is very quite and intimate.  \n\nThe party room was so noisy we had ear fatigue and at the end of dinner and we all were grumpy from the noise.  \n\nPlus we couldn't hear each other talk. \n\nOf course the food was good.  But the worst service I have seen on a long time. \n\nMaybe I'll try and eat there again in 5 years after I have forgotten about the 1200 dollar dinner I hosted where we were punished.  \n\nThis was at the Vegas location.  \n\nThanks for nothing craft steak by the way yes I did complain and no they did not care. \n\nGive me a break I buy dinners for a living and these guys suck.
1;The service was weak (it took a long time to be served even though that place was three quarters empty and our server was not very responsive to our needs), the food was not that great , even the guacamole tasted like store bought . Good tortilla chips but the salsa was weak. The tacos were fair, some of the food tasted under done. The atmosphere was fair to poor. I would not recommend this place.
3;Love the decor and atmosphere (what's not to love about old movie props and cheesy hollywood tie ins?) and the menu is quite alright (albeit pricey). Thankfully there were a few vegetarian items on the menu so I wasn't left out. My boyfriend got the Kobe chili nachos and was in heaven. He hardly put a dent in the massive plate they gave him! Good, but their food is kind of generic. You come more for the atmosphere.
1;Irritating beeping behind the line for at least 3 minutes while we waited 6 minutes to get our coffee
0;We were on day seven of a 27 state road trip when we stayed here.  We used a coupon from one of the green books at the roadside information centers and were not expecting a whole lot for $39.99 plus tax (for a total of $46...What were we thinking?).\n\nThe best thing about our stay was that the manager was very understanding and quickly changed rooms when we were dissatisfied with the initial one (there was a lot of renovation activity going on near the room, there was construction waste and laborers making noise).\n\nThe location of the second room was better, but its condition was quite rundown (carpets, furniture, bathroom, door locks).  There was no refrigerator, microwave, or breakfast. They did have coffee in the lobby and some nice Hazelnut creamer.\n\nThe friendly manager did call up ask if the room was okay, but we decided we could tough it out.\n\nI expect things will get better here because this was clearly one of the rooms which had not yet been renovated (our visit was during the last week in May 2014).\n\nAfter this experience we were much more careful about checking reviews prior to relying on coupons from the rest stops (and generally used Hotwire for places with satisfaction ratings higher than 75% - this worked very well).
4;I recently started looking to get into riding and had a ton of questions. I worked with Tom and he was awesome. He took me through all of the types of bikes and tried to find the one that would work for me rather than just try to sell me the first $1000 bike he could.  I went back in today with some follow up questions and he was just as helpful.\nThe store itself is very nice and well stocked with a variety of equipment and clothes. I will definitely be back.
1;Meh -- tried the supposed best that Pittsburgh had to offer in Chinese and was disappointed. Mediocre noodle dishes -- the zha jia mien used noodles that were lacking in firmness. Other dishes I had were on the extremes of either being too salty or too flat and tasteless. \n\nAlso, weird tasting water.
4;Purchased a groupon coupon to try this place out since it was so close to my house. \nFrom the outside it didn't look like much but when you walk inside WOW very upper class nice flooring, hair stations, lighting and relaxing music. The front desk staff was very nice offered water, coffee, tea. I had Phillip the owner do my hair. He was a very interesting person to get to know great conversationalist makes getting you hair done half the wait. What an honor to have the actual business owner of a hair salon do you hair not to mention a master hair designer that uses low ammonia hair dye imported from Italy. It is hard to find a good master hair designer in Vegas. I had my hair cut and colored blow dried and straightened. I was given a complementary neck and should massage by his assistant. My hair turned out amazing tons of complements when I left from family and friends. Thank you Salon Charisma my hair never looked this good your service is amazing I will definitely be back.
4;"I started hearing about this place a few months ago, and then really got intrigued when Fat Heads pulled the Lindemans off tap & switched it to Arsenal.  Last week I picked ~400lbs of pears at the family farm with the intention of making cider, but turns out I don't have much of a clue how to pull it off.  So, I stopped in with the hope that they could point me in the right direction, and they did not disappoint.\n\nBill & Michelle are great people, and I hope their business thrives. I don't have enough cider experience to really sing their praises, but it is very good and easy to drink...but be careful, it can be as strong as wine.  \nTheir establishment is in the bottom half of their house in Lawrenceville, so that alone speaks to their dedication to the craft; they literally live & breathe cider.  Bill was very helpful in giving me some cider-making pointers, so if you're looking to small-batch, stop by, get some advice, and be sure to take home a growler or two.   Come on Yelpers, stop by and buy some cider!"
1;I had the mac n cheese burger with fries. My friends ordered the tacos, wings & lettuce wrap. This place is pretty hyped up and overpriced for the quality of food. My burger didn't have any special flavor to it. Just a burger and they slapped some mac n cheese in the middle in place of a regular cheese.  I could have gone to In n Out or Five Guys Burger for half the price and some free peanuts. What a disappointment. I'll give 2 stars cause our server was really pleasant.
0;Me giving one star is gracious. My roommate and I went here tonight. I have been to this restaurant when it was just the sushi room and loved it! However tonight was different. I made a reservation for 630, the hostess asked us to sit at the bar while they prepared the table,and then sat 12 other people at the table before she remembered the two of us. When we sat down we ordered, the waitress took forever to bring the soup which was Luke warm at best and tasted like soapy dish water. The salad didn't come until the chef started making our food. This was good. But as everyone was receiving their fried rice and steamed rice,my roommate and I noticed we had not gotten our steamed rice. We had to ask another waiter for rice.\nI had new York steak and shrimp. My roomie had chicken and filet mignon. My steak was over cooked I asked for medium rare. Her chicken as well was over cooked. Neither were seasoned barely at all. The shrimp was good tho. Unfortunately after I saw the owner ask a table full of people who were done eating and chatting if they could please move because while they appreciate their business there were people waiting. I knew my complaints would be irrelevant.\nNeedless to say I'm disappointed in the food, the service, all of it. And will never go back for tempanyaki. They have alot of kinks to work out.
4;Every time I come here it never disappoints me always a blast and the bartenders are always on their A game
3;I love buying and cooking with flavored olive oils and vinegars. Olive Gourmet opened up near my house right as I was running low, and I needed to stop in immediately. The owners are very nice and friendly, the selection of olive oils they have on hand is great, and the quality is outstanding. I like that I was able to sample the olive oils and balsamics in the store before buying them, and I frequently stop by just to see what's new. Fantastic store, and I'm glad it opened.
3;So  I was little freaked out when I turned up this morning to find talk radio and Sheriff Joe, doing something to do with a book? and the flag? confusing. Anyhow I got the chair I wanted for my husband (zero gravity chair) which was STILL in stock 2 days after Thanksgiving. (and still on sale) After a few minutes of being ignored and I looked confused, someone did help me. The downer was they they don't sell any of their bison or elk meet in a refrigerated or frozen form (to-go) and they didn't have any large stainless steel water bottles or lip balm which attached to your key chain, which are two things I was looking for and thought they'd have there. They also didn't have a place where I could pull the car around to load up the chair, so  instead I hauled it out to the parking lot. It wasn't too heavy, so all's well that ends well.
4;"Courteous staff and an owner who \""loves\"" food.  Food that is both delicious and nutritious"
1;The free popcorn is a nice perk, but agree with the useful feedback from Jennifer that it is just an older / showing it's age theater that is better for a spur of the moment movie vs. say premiere of Batman or the like.  \n\nI think it's days are #'d thou, once the Harkin's comes into the Estrella Falls mall (once that happens).
2;Played the Peaks course and the greens were rock hard so nothing held, not even little chips. I didn't mind the layout so much but make sure you get a map of the course from the pro shop if this is your first time around because there is a lot of blind shots. This course is targety and has many split fairways that end in desert. The greens putted really nicely, very fast and smooth. I wasn't super impressed with the starter who questioned me about my HCP like I was being interrogated by the police. I guess he was concerned I wasn't a low enough handicapper to play off the blue or black tees which is silly because the course isn't tough from any tee. He also told us to speed up because we had a hole and a half ahead of us but when  we teed off we never saw a group ahead of us and people weren't waiting behind us so he did the typical ranger power trip and ended up disturbing myself and my group by making us speed up when we didn't need to.\n\nMake extra time to play the putting course out front, 18 holes and very fun.\n\nI payed $30 for a cart, round and all the practice I want, not a bad deal for this time of year I guess if you like a drive out in the middle of no mans land.
1;I really wanted to love this place especially because I like supporting neighborhood restaurants instead of the big chains.  However, the food is just marginal.  The egg roll was so small, lacked flavor and was very mushy - perhaps it was a frozen variety?  The cashew chicken had very little chicken and cashews and way too many mushrooms.  The mongolian beef was okay, but not the best I've ever had.  Ordered the crispy honey chicken for the kiddos and it should have been called the mushy chicken.  I think if they would infuse some more flavor to their menu then this could be a great place.
0;"Worst show ever!\n\nIt's the most gross, childish, low class degrading show I've ever seen in Vegas.\n\nI paid good money for it but had to walk out during the show. What? Making rude jokes on private body parts so bluntly, and making fun on all the colored people doesn't entertain me. And tasteless jokes on anyone who's liberal or conservative, anyone would find this show shocking. I know it's an equal discrimination, but I wouldn't pay a penny for it. \n\nIf you're looking for a sexy show, this is not it. It's not a topless show. And it's a lot more expensive than most if not all of the adult shows in Vegas. And the show is performed in a circus \""tent\"" rather than an actual theater. It's amazing that they charge so much. There were some nice parts in the show, that's the nice acrobatic performances, but half of the time, it's filled with insulting humors that make me frown with shock. I'm a liberal person by heart but don't find rude jokes on gays and minorities funny or entertaining.\n\nI'm surprised that Caesar Palace, who hosts reputable shows like Celine Dion, Elton John, Shania Twain and Rod Stewart, would host such a degrading and senseless show like Absinthe. If you're wondering if you should go to this show, DON'T!  Save your money instead and use it on the many other good shows in Vegas like Love, Zumanity, etc. As for the other 4 and 5 star reviews?  Obviously cast members posting shameless promotional reviews.  \n\nSimply disgraceful."
3;The BF and I went to the grand opening last night and I was pretty impressed. This restaurant/bar has a nice modern vibe and an extensive menu of hot items and sushi. We sat on the patio where the misters were out of control (read: it felt like it was a rainy day and we were just barely under an awning....not that this was a bad thing). We ended up sharing a few items including: Cucumber rolls (pretty standard), buffalo chicken roll (this was ridiculously good...the buffalo sauce was spicy and delicious, the chicken was crunchy, it was a definite winner), and the kobe burger with Tokyo fries (the burger was good, it had caramelized onions and spicy aioli on it and came on some kind of flatbread....definitely tasty...they cooked it a little over what we ordered it at, but it was still tasty. Additionally, they forgot to give us the fries, but when I told our waiter he got them for us, so no problem there. The fries were good, nice and crispy and they had been fried in fish oil so they had a slight fish taste to them....but in a good way).  We also had a few drinks, that were all tasty. I had the deep water, which tasted like a jolly rancher, but not in that weird synthetic way some drinks like that may taste, but in a fresh way. It was very good. I also tried the revolver which had a delicious ginger flavor. The BF had whiskey sours which were on special for only 3$ (awesome!) and they were also tasty. Overall, there were a few snags, but it was good. I will definitely try them again.
2;"So the Tropicana is going over a huge transformation. They have made quite a few huge changes but I can tell that they still do have a long way to go... I gave this place a three star rating because it's still a work in progress. \n\nMy bf and I came to this hotel and we booked two nights (one each) - we wanted to take part in the $50 bucks a room and you get $50 of free slot credits. - By the looks of it anyone can get the free $50 slot credit, I wasn't even asked for my room card or anything. (That was kind of disappointing after all of the trouble that we went through to book two rooms.) \n\nFor the first hotel room I mentioned the free upgrade to the Paradise tower as specified in the deal summary in travel zoo.... The woman helping me wasn't much help. All she told me was ... \""Uhh.. we can get you the Island tower\"". I should have been more persistent about getting the Paradise tower instead but I happen to be too much of a nice little pushover. I need to bring out my authoritative voice out more often! My bf on the other hand was lucky (or just more demanding) and we got the room in the Paradise tower - like we were supposed to get in the first place! \n\nHere is my opinion of the first room ... Eww. The room was tacky with really old decor. I felt like someone might have used this room in the past in order to film an adult film. :-/ I mean there was mirrors on the side wall on the back wall, and on the ceiling.  I felt kind of creeped out about the fact that I can see myself in so many angles. (I usually try to avoid getting such a good look of myself.) The bed was hard and the bedding was old and typical of an old hotel. Anyways... the room served it's purpose. It was a place to sleep for the night. (Although not a very good one) If this room was an upgrade... I'd hate to see what the basic room was supposed to have been... \n\nNow on the the second room. The Paradise Tower! Oh my! This room was awesome! This room was really way up there on my list of nicest hotel rooms that i've ever stayed in! Everything was new! Everything looked very finished! There was even detailing on the ceiling! The alarm clock was an iPhone dock! The TV was updated! the bed was softer! I have no complaints at all whatsoever. I wish I could have stayed in this room for much longer! :'( \n\nThe hotel as a whole ... Meh... the casino was okay I guess. It wasn't the best. I've seen better - (right across the street) \n\nThe pool... I'm not sure if I can give a very accurate review of the pool since I didn't really spend too much time in it. It was way too cold. I quickly made my way over to the jacuzzi after discovering it. Overall the area was very pretty. I never saw the old pool area but the pool seems really updated and nice! :) \n\nMy last opinion... if you're going to name a hotel \""Tropicana\"" and model it around Miami/Cuba.... Give it more justice than to just have a little cafe with a Cuban flag in it containing 1 Cuban sandwich. Also the live music they played. *Thumbs down* \n\nI think that wraps it up! - Thats I'll I've got for the Tropicana!"
2;Good coffee, wonderful aroma..a lot of noise.\n\nI went here a few times while my sister was in the hospital across the street. As mentioned previously everything was great (good seating, good people) until the operated the roaster. Since my main purpose frequenting coffee houses is to work (novelist) the noise of the roaster was just too much to ignore for me, Aside from the noise the place makes a great cup of coffee and is well worth a visit if you're in the area.
0;"Living at Scottsdale Springs is like being in an abusive relationship, and when you break up, finding out they gave you an STD.  Moving in, everyone says the same thing... \""It won't happen to me\"". It will, and the only thing I can say is PROTECT YOURSELF, because Scottsdale Springs will attract you with their low move in costs, inexpensive rent, and great location, and then, once you're committed, they will screw you. They will move a family of 5 Acrobats in to a one bedroom apartment above you, they will tell you there in no \""transfer fee\"" to move apartments, but then when moving day comes and your packed and loading the truck, they will tell you there is a $200 deposit on the new apartment, and a $100 admin fee. Oh, and just an FYI, all the cop cars in the parking lot...that is not on-site security.  \n\nSo if after reading this you are still the type to fall for the \""bad boy,\"" go for it, but remember, when you go in the office, get EVERYTHING in writing, keep your lease paperwork, and please please please, schedule a walk through before you move out, and TAKE PICTURES! Welcome Home"
4;My wife and I had an appointment at a specific time and we were running behind. We decided to try and find someplace to eat breakfast and after using Yelp, we stumbled across this place.  The food was amazing, the service was exceptionally fast and friendly.  We will be back!  Biscuits and gravy were off the hook!
1;Stained sheets, hair and food byproduct on nightstand When we got our replacement sheets there was no offer to change them as they were thrust into our hands. Burned out lightbulbs and towels that look like what I use to dry off the dog.
1;I'd give this place a 3 or 3.5 stars if the prices weren't so damn high. Ever since I saw Rachel Ray visit the NYC location, I've been wanting to try the frozen hot chocolate.\n\nI only wanted a little snack to go with my Frozen Hot Chocolate, but everything was way overpriced...sandwiches $14, app's were $9 and up.  I settled for the potato skins, Spudniks about $9, really?  The frozen Hot Chocolate was around $14.  \n\nThe skins were tasty, but for that price, I could get the same food at TGIF for less.  The Frozen Hot Chocolate was basically a chocolate milkshake. Yes, it was yummy.  Yes, it was huge.  BUT, it really wasn't to die for, thus the high price is not justified.\n\nThe place is decorated cute with the Tiffany style lamps on the tables. The location is good, on the front exterior of Caesar's Palace.  The service was way too sloooooow.  It took forever for our waiter to get our drink order and it took awhile to get our food.  \n\nIt was good to try and I'd probably check out the one in NYC, but I don't think I will be coming back to this location.
1;We visited because this place had good yelp reviews, but it was a complete let down.  It was nearly dead around 10pm, and within 30 minutes it started closing.  So we left and went to a real pub -Whiski Bar if you're interested.
3;When it comes to organization, there is nothing that tops Container Store!!\nI've found things to help me organize things I never knew needed organizing!\n\nI recently purchased a $600 shelving system for a retail space - and after putting together a few Ikea cabinets for another part of the store - it was a breathe of fresh air to assemble something that didn't require any hardware but looked killer! Aside from that I've purchased everything from large simplehuman trash cans to teal, flowery pencil cups. Great selection of everything needed to put your OCD in check.\n\nSome of my favorites are the cord/computer wiring organization. There is a company called Bluelounge that carries a cordbox that rocks. \n\nI live in Tempe so the drive is a bit out of the way - but it's sooo worth it! \n\nPS - They are SUPER pet friendly!!
1;This review is for their brunch buffet.  I've actually been to their dinner buffet before and I'd give their dinner buffet 4 stars!  So I was hoping brunch would live up to their dinner, but sadly, it didn't.  Brunch was $40 and I was really excited cuz I was starving, but when I got my food an started eating, I was disappointed.  Nothing really stood out as being really good.  Presentation is nice, but if the food's just ok, it makes me sad.  I got a lot of food (I eat a lot) - prime rib (which was ok and kinda tough and bloody, but I've definitely had better), ribs (which were dry), squid ceviche (meh), dungeoness crab quiche (didn't see or taste the crab), an omelet (just an omelet), eggs benedict (i've definitely had better, and the muffin was burnt), cute mini waffle with fruit (i think this was my favorite, which is kinda sad), congee (I was surprised they had preserved eggs, but the congee itself lacked flavor and needed a lot of salt), yogurt parfait (i sadly think mcdonald's is better and i'm boycotting that place!), grapefruit (sour), a macaroon (not good...so sad!), bread pudding (i've had so much better!!), this marshmellow thingy (meh) and a couple other desserts which weren't very memorable.  \n\nAs far as service goes, our waitress was...not sure how to put it...she asked if we wanted drinks and we all gave her our order but when she repeated it, she forgot a few of our drinks and we had to repeat it for her.  She didn't write anything down and when she came back with our drinks, she kinda got it wrong...\n\nOverall, I left feeling full, but dissatisfied.  I've had my share of buffets in Vegas, and although I think this place has a pretty good dinner buffet (from the last time I was here, which was a few years ago...I'm hoping it's still the same), they need to up it a notch or two for their brunch.  My fav so far is Bellagio's brunch AND dinner!  We only chose to come here cuz the wait was shorter (half hour compared to an hour and a half at Bellagio, but I guess there's a reason...).
0;NEVER AGAIN!  Arrived for New Year's Weekend. Paid for early check-in and room was ready but staff was cold, curt and not welcoming at all. Got same reception when we checked out on Monday. Tiled floors in room: dirty. Paint in bathroom: large section chipped/peeling. Free wi-fi advertised but very weak signal - constantly lost contact.  I prefer to give my $$ to gay owned businesses but after this experience we will be staying on the Strip where the service is world's better!
0;Service was very poor for us. I think the problem was that we drink water with our meal. Therefore, they don't seem to come around after we get our food. They surely do cater on the drinkers. The steak was to be done med rare but it was cooked totally done not even a pink center. What a waste of our time. Never again. And we didn't leave a tip coz of the poor service.
4;Love the show so being able to see the car collection up close was a real treat. Even bought a shirt that Danny autographed. Thanks for the show.
4;"I was not expecting to find a good steakhouse at NY NY, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Well, actually, it was more like a shock.  I definitely recommend this place.  \n\nThe aged bone-in rib eye was really good and the taste is authentic.  If you like steak and you always hit a steakhouse on your Vegas trip... then you should definitely try this place.  The taste is Very Unique, Very Gallagher. ;)\n\nThe wine list is also decent (I say decent because they only list the winery and not the vintage) and they offer a good selection by the glass.  I was surprised to find Justin Obtuse on the dessert wine menu.  (Not too many restaurants carry this one...)\n\nThe price isn't outrageous compared to other Vegas steakhouses.  The food is awesome but the decor is outdated."
0;We used to love this place until our rent keep going up. The leasing office people are hard to work with and the place actually start breaking down. And they never fix anything anymore at all. And heard a lot of bad experiences from the neighbors about people in the leasing office are  horrible and not very helpful. Well, we plan to move out anyway and will never recommend this place to anyone. I walk pass behind the G garage for months where's the mailbox is to pick up my mails and the huge puddle and very stink and also mosquitoes flying around on it, awful. Feel sorry for people that live in the unit near by.
2;I spotted the cool big rust colored metal sun on the side of the building & suggested trying this place instead of driving to Rolberto's on 7th St & Camelback.\n\nI'm trying not to judge this place too harshly since the happy hour prices are pretty darn good & the people are super friendly. I want to go back & try more things on their menu with different sauces & styles.\n\nFree chips but you don't get that many at a time. They're a little greasy, but still good. I love chunky salsa & there isn't any. They have 2 different kinds that come in bottles. The more brownish 1 had a smokey almost chipotle flavor. It was actually really good.\n\nMy meal: Chicken chimi. No melted cheese on top, came on the side. No pico de gallo, costs $1.50 extra. Majorly unhappy about that. If it came automatically I'd really like this place. Meat was a little bland.\n\nFriend's meal: Chicken chimi recommended by Jose enchilada style w/ green sauce which was an extra $1-1.50. The chimi needed the sauce to not be as bland. It did taste really good this way. Beans & rice is an extra $2. Refried beans were good. They weren't salty & were very cheesy.\n\nMy happy hour $3.50 house margarita came in a margarita glass! What's with places not using margarita glasses?! It could have used more salt. At least they didn't water it down or skimp on alcohol. I wasn't carded. I'm over 21 & was the only 1 drinking but my friend is not 21 yet. He was driving but they probably would have served him.\n\nI like the decor. They have a room or 2 off the main 1 for overflow or big crowds. The restroom wasn't necessarily dirty, but it was pretty run down. The mirror in there is way too nice for the restroom. It's funny.\n\nWe also had 2 soft drinks. The bill was almost $30 total.
0;Don't be fooled by happy hour prices. I went yesterday and the waitress talked about 1/2 price appetizers, drinks, well drinks, etc. That price is only good at the bar. If you are at a table you will not get it. I went with some friends and we ordered drinks and appetizers. An order of chicken wings, an order of pretzels, 2 double vodka & 7ups, a single vodka & 7up and 4 coke & crowns. All ordered before 7pm when happy hour is over. Total price $ 71. Someone in management must have ridden that bull and hit their head - and the waitresses false advertise until the bill comes. If you are out for a happy hour in Tempe drive on past this place.
0;"Went on their \""3$ vodka Wednesday.. Not only was it advertised on their website, but it was also on their facebook page. I even wrote a review\""Well , this isn't exactly true is it? Came here last night for e special. ..Manager/Bartender completely uninformed and dint honor specials. Knew nothing about it. Family used to come here a few times a month- never again. Customer service-=horrid service\"". What I didn't add to the Facebook page was that the manager said he would \""take care of us\"", which I can only assume meant ignore us the entire time and do nothing for the bill and then take down my post off of Facebook later. YES they removed my comments later and reported me as spam. I definitely will not return. The food is not that great , nor was the service"
1;This place just had a really inconsistent selection of food.  We went for the brunch, which ended up being $20 a person.  The breakfast was weird - the eggs were soft like I like them but had a strange rice-like consistency, the sausages were also mushy inside, and the bacon was not crunchy but not limp either.  The sushi was just eh, not memorable - it tasted like it had been made earlier and refrigerated, because it was cold and kind of hard. The shrimp was peel-n-eat, which is a good way to keep lazy people from eating it. The fresh fruit (grapes, pineapples, strawberries) were good, and so was the stir fried veggies.  The corned beef was way dry, but the BBQ pork ribs were pretty damn good.  *sigh* what can I say? After eating at Wynn the night before, TI couldn't even compare. We just wanted something quick before going to the airport, so I guess this place worked in a pinch. But, if you had a choice and wanted to pay something in the same price bracket, I think the one at the Mirage was much better from my last visit to Vegas.
2;I've been torn about my review of Giada for a couple weeks now.  There were some HUGE highs and some MAJOR lows of my experience there.  I will appologize for the length of this review, in advance. If someone from management reads this, I will be glad to discuss further.\n\nI was traveling for work and having dinner by myself.  I stopped into Giada (2 weeks after opening) and asked how long the wait will be and if i could just find a spot at the bar.  The manager at the front of the house said that the bar was being used for overflow, and that the wait would be about 45 minutes to sit.  I agreed and went to play some blackjack at the Cromwell.\n\nAfter about an hour, nobody called, so i went to check.  Upon arriving, the hostess said that I could be seated.  On my way to the seat (which ended up being at the bar), she offered to give me a tour of the restaurant.  She showed me the house made pasta, the kitchen, the bread, and other areas,  I was very excited to feast.\n\nAs I sat at the bar, i ordered a McClellan scotch.  The bartender then gave me an iPad menu.  As I was looking through the menu, i only saw Antipasto dishes.  I asked if I could see the complete menu, and was then told that only antipasto is available at the bar.  This was not explained to me, and I was even led to believe (due to the tour and conversation with the hostess) that the entire menu was available.\n\nAfter looking at the menu for 15 minutes, I decided I would not eat there because I did not just want antipasto.  I asked for the check, but the bartender, Katie (who was amazing) asked me to please stay and said the would find the manager for me.  She also said that she would bring me out some antipasto dishes while I was waiting.\n\nThey brought out some big antipasto dishes, and I will admit that they were quite good.  There exceeded my expectations, and I was happy I stayed.  Finally as I was eating, the manager did come out.  He then went to the couple next to me, and asked them if everything was OK.  They said things were fine.  I knew he was supposed to ask me, but because I look young and was dressed in a T-shirt, I think he decided to ignore me.  The bartender then gesture to him that he was supposed to be talking to ME,  He then asked me if everything was OK.\n\nI explained the situation to him, and told him I really wanted to try the food from the full menu.  I know that he has made this exception for people in the past from talking to the bartender (and that is why she called him), but he decided not to budge for me.  He gave me some BS excuse and I could tell he was just not being very genuine.  It honestly would have been better for the restaurant to just not even had him come see me.  He basically offered nothing and then left.  He said he would get me a free drink, that never game\n\nSo, why 3 stars?  The bartender, Katie, is AMAZING,  She made a terrible experience great. If not for her, this would have been a 1 star review.  She is an asset to Giada.  She only charged me for the drinks I had and didn't charge for the food (since I didn't even want to order it).  Obviously, she got a large tip.  If the manager didn't come out, this would be a 4-5 star review.\n\nThe manager that came out was terrible.  He treated me with little respect and deserved to make this a 1 star review.  The management is a liability to Giada, and she should rethink who is running the customer facing team.  In addition, they should explain the the full menu is not offered at the bar.\n\nI will go back to Giada, sit at a table, and try the full menu.  For now, this experience left me in the middle.
4;I recently purchased a Groupon deal and decided to give Dance Life a shot. I was mainly interested in the fitness classes but was also intrigued by the belly dance/bolly  classes. I have to say it is the most awesome decision I've ever made. I started going last week and have been there every day of the week. The owner Arielle is just an amazing performer/ teacher and an amazing person, all the instructors are so friendly and awesome. The whole place has such a positive energy, it  just makes for such a joyous experience.  I love every single class I have been to and normally at the gym I find myself checking my watch every five minutes and here even though the class are an hour long it always feels like its over too soon. Very soon I'm gonna buy the monthly membership and continue my fitness journey. Its the best decision I ever made and  I would recommend Belly Dance to every woman I know, its such an amazing art form and I am so glad I gave it a shot, it truly has transformed the way I see myself and I am a much more confident person because of it. I love this place and I highly recommend it to everyone, you should most definitely check it out.
3;It is now over eighteen months since we started coming here.  We have found Sean and his family run business to be great!\n\nI wrote my previous review after waiting six months following a very bad series of incidents at another cleaner -- which has a chain here in AZ.  At this other place, the pockets on my dress shirts started ripping at the inside corners from rough ironing.  The kids who work there weren't of any help to us. Finally the absentee owner finally got involved and gave us a credit on future business for the damage.  \n\nOkay, so much for the history of how we came to Ultra.  \n\nNEVER again will we go to a chain.  Family run businesses care much more about getting it right and pleasing the customer.  Mr. Sean, as we call him and his family have been great to us.  We've used all the services, from comforters, to alterations, dress shirts, suits, you name it.  I'll say it a third time, they're great!\n\nA shout out to Yelp'er Roland W, who when we were searching Yelp for a new place had posted a nice review.  Thank you!
2;"My husband and I got a kick out of the kitschy Bill's Gambling Hall, the newest addition to the strip.  It looks straight out of the 70s, which is kind of weird since it's new and all, but we pretended to forget that and played slot poker.\n\nMy dad is named Bill, and whenever he really likes something (the two things so far have been Starbucks and a McDonalds), we call them \""Bill's McDonalds\"" or whatever.  It was like Bill's Casino came predestined to be my dad's favorite.  In a sad twist of irony, he isn't much of a gambler, but we still tried to go eat in the Victorian Room in the middle of the night, since my husband was so intrigued by their advertisements of $.99 margaritas and $4.25 hotcakes, sausage and eggs (or something similar).  The wait was so long, we never figured it out.  It was still a cool place to check out, though, and a nice respite from $8 beers and $12 pancakes."
4;Came here last week and it was truly awesome! Had those garlic knots and never tasted anything remotely close to them, they were that great! \n\nEnjoyed the atmosphere and ambiance, truly seemed like a neighborhood hangout! \n\nOrdered a pizza, the one with six slices, and it was also great! Not my favorite but a close runner up! Had sausage and pepperoni on it and was very pleased!\n\nNext time an in Vegas this will be on my short list.
0;If I could give this restaurant negative stars, I would.  The service was atrocious and I got sick from the tiny plate of food I EVENTUALLY received.  Very disappointed to say the least.  They were willing to comp my COFFEE because of the long waits...how sad.  I think Thomas Keller would be embarrassed if he knew what a pathetic experience we had.
0;"Poor quality, too expensive, dirty.\n\nI give up on this place for their all-you-can-eat salad and pizza buffet which costs way too much (about $10). Consistently poor quality pizza, stained carpet, unmotivated staff. I've eaten here for lunch for almost three years now, and every time I go back I keep asking myself \""Why do I bother coming back to this place?\"" Today, tables were unclean, and the salad bar had cottage cheese that tasted spoiled and the pizza was really poor quality. I know how hard it is to run a pizza establishment, and I feel for anyone who tries, really I do, but if you have time to lean, you have time to clean. Somebody needs to learn how to pick up a rag instead of texting on their cell phone.\n\nHint: take down the tip jar. We all know you expect a tip for nothing. It shows."
4;Well, in my opinion, it doesn't get much better than The Signature.  Check-in is always fast and painless.  The rooms are always spotless.  Nice lounge and pools.  \n\nKeep up the great work!!
2;I got the Chicken Florentine Cr\u00eape, it was pretty bland not worth the price. My friend got the Rosemary chicken panini which was amazing, great flavors! The vanilla latte and Carmel macchiato were not good at all they tasted like syrup. The employees were friendly, but there was trash all over the empty tables and it took the employees about 15 mins to pick it up.
2;Really nice atmosphere. Mostly good food. Eh on the service. Caprese and scallops vet excellent. Carbonara was good. Mussels, not so much. Don't clear the table I'd someone at it is still eating. And someone needs to tell them lemoncello shouldn't double as paint thinner. I can check it off the list as having been.
1;I knew it was going to be a fail as I watched the 'Barista' slopping together a latte for the customer in front of me.  I ordered a coffee of the day instead--meh, I've had better.  My wife got a soy latte:  he dumped the milk in, without technique, and over-heated the milk.  It was a watery, soppy mess.  \n\nWe want Nicholas to be great--or now, better.  Train the staff!
1;I usually get OK service. The store is larger in size and carries more than a few others sprint stores I've been to so I usually come back.\n\nThe last 2 times I've experienced 2 complete opposite experiences.  The 1st time I was in and out in less than half an hour.  Customer service was pretty good, answering whatever questions I had and even helped me order a replacement phone.  The 2nd time I was there for almost 2 hours. There was about the same number of customers as last time. Called the night before and was told that all I had to do was pick up the phone, it would already be activated and whatever else it needed. Patiently waited maybe they lost it or something. Everyone who helped me was very helpful except for this one guy who lacked customer service. He had a smug smirk to his face and seemed as if I was bothering him from standing around and staring out the window with my 2 simple questions.
3;"Went here recently. It's very yummy. A short story, a couple of years ago we saw a Food network special about this kind of \""shaved ice\"" and was craving it. Eventually we got some in LA and it was everything we wanted.  Jump back to a couple of days ago, my sister said we have to go there. Get the Thai Tea, shaved ice. That flavor is really good. I then tried the milk Thai Tea with lychee jelly. It was surprisingly good.\n\nThis store is a little small, so if there are a lot of people in there it gets really packed.   \n\nIt is $6.75 for a large, perfect to share. Try this, you can thank me later."
4;Don't know if it is located in a bad area of if Phoenix is depressing and crappy in general - I'm not from there so wouldn't know.\nThe food is great here!  What a find!  I luckily stumbled accross it on a trip cross country.  At first I thought it would be bad because there was a fat lady eating alone there.  Usually fat people eat at cheap places that serve huge quantities but that was not the case here.   I learned a lesson from this fat woman....it changed my opinion of fat people and made me less prejudiced towards them.\nWay to go Thai Rama and way to go fat lady!  Kudos to both of you.
2;Came here with a VERY large group, which the staff quickly accommodated.... and didn't mind when we continue to pull tables over for friends who kept trickling in. At AYCE sushi at less than $25, it's a freaking steal. And AYCE means ALLLLL YCE....... the entire menu, no time limit, no charges for leftover food (but they won't bring new food unless you finish it).\n\nMy advice:\n- Order half rolls so you can try more\n- Share everything!\n- Seafood salad.... all sashimi with no rice. Best bang for your buck!\n- Wear loose-fitting clothes, because you are about to get down on some serious fatassery\n- Don't come here if you plan to wear a ho dress to a club immediately afterward.\n\nI wish I could remember all I tried, but we tried just about everything, including ice cream. They also serve sake and beer, which my side of the table indulged in (and quickly because those loud, boisterous people, which no one seemed to mind). \n\nI wish I could give them more stars..... but the service wasn't the friendliest. A friend of mine who doesn't eat seafood was completely ignored, and his dish wasn't brought out until we were almost done. We also noticed that we were charged for 4 bottles of sake, when we only ordered 3. We told our waitress, and a few minutes later, 4 waitresses filed out together, stood in a line to confront us, and angrily insisted that we ordered 4. It was pretty unecessary and in poor taste. We eventually resolved it and paid for the 3. That left a bad taste in my mouth, but the sushi and the copious amounts of booze left an amazing taste. 3 stars.
2;Yes, Whole Foods is expensive. However, there are some gems in here that are worth the money. Some of those goodies are found in the deli. However, for every great find (corn and arugula salad!) there are also some misses in the deli. The fish section is one of the better few that I have found in the Valley (but that also means you will pay extra for the increased quality). Overall, WF has a good selection (especially in hot sauces) and a nice layout. You will pay more money than a typical grocery store, but it is also apparent where those extra dollars are going.
4;Twinkle Tan is awesome! This is not my first spray tan, but it was my first by air brush... I will never go back to booth spray again!! I highly recommend Twinkle Tan! I feel amazing....
0;I went in with my 1 year old son and 3 year old daughter to pick up my husband's birthday gift (a special, hard to find champagne). When I approached an employee for help I was in the middle of requesting help when he interrupted me and told me that I needed to get out, that they weren't allowed in the store (my children). Very rude and abrasive! I left in tears. My husband and I spend a lot of money stocking his wine cellar. In this tough economy where we sacrifice in some areas of our lives in an effort to continue other ventures in life I am sick and tired of poor customer service, I'll take my $ elsewhere. Total Wine and Spirits is cheaper and offers better customer service. Lees will never see my husband or I again. And to the disrespectful clerk, careful who you talk to as if they were a petulant child, you may come to find you no longer have a job when you show up to work the next day. I don't see why Total Wine has no issues with children in the store as long as they are with a responsible parent, and why if your store policies are different are you unable to train your employees to still be courteous to the situation rather than arrogantly rude.
4;When we're in the mood for some entertainment and teppanyaki, Geisha House is where we go.  This is great place for kids and family.\n\nAt the times we've gone it wasn't busy at all... This is usually around 7 or 8pm at night on a weekday.\n\n\nThe last time we were here we took my son for his birthday and he absolutely loved it.  The chefs there are awesome and their tricks are fun to watch.  I really want to try the onion volcano at home!   It was funny to watch them sing happy birthday to him as well.\n\nHe had so much fun, after we left he let us know that he wants to be a chef and do what they do.\n\nWe've had their Steak and Chicken and it is delicious and worth the price.  The fried rice is delicious.  They have this red buttery sauce they put on everything.  I find that we always take home food, so the food to price ratio is right on.\n\nOur drinks were always full, the staff was extremely friendly, especially to our children, the place is clean and the atmosphere is fun!
0;"A party of 7 - we drank water 1 appetizer and a $600 check all in the confines of an indoor mall...\nDon't get me wrong, the food was wonderful but just a bit out of hand.  2 pairs of people ordered the same entree items and they came out completely different sizes and  for myself, the shrimp was just not delicious.  For 36 bucks I wants some delicious shrimp!\nThe server was by far the worst server I've ever encountered!  I wanted to read the menu but he insisted on up-selling every freaking thing!!  Dude back the f-up, I wanna read, not hear the ingredients in a rue! He kept interrupting our rather enjoyable conversation to tell us about \""artisinal water\"" or some other crap they've up-charged for.  Frankly at the end of the night I felt like I was just sold a used car with a side of fish...  Hey Rick, time to rethink your wait staff.  This one waiter RUINED your restaurant..."
0;Look left, right, and around at the signage at Bally's- $1 margaritas at Happy Hour.  Nope, wrong - they are $2 each, and come with an attitude.  Boo.
3;"thanks to dana s for the uye trivia. they had kilkenny so i was happy. ordered the shepards pie. they turned the top of the gravy into a zen garden with cool designs. it had a good salt level. some places go way overboard on the salt. our waiter was a good character and had no problem doing separate checks! \n\nthe quiz portion was fun! although i think our large group was excited and yelling out answers. i was guilty of this as well. after the quiz ended it got really quiet. a little too quiet.\n\n[The three Turtles infiltrate The Shredder's junkyard.]\nDonatello: The perimeter's quiet.\nLeonardo: Yeah, a little too quiet.\nMichelangelo: Come on.\n[The Turtles sneak forward; Donatello takes out two sentries solo]\nDonatello: Well, that was easy.\nLeonardo: Yeah, a little too easy.\n[They see Raphael tied to a post]\nDonatello: Look, it's Raph!\nMichelangelo: Yeah, a little too Raph.\n\nwhen i first used the bathroom i kept trying to lift the handle to wash my hands at the sink, but realized after like 2 attempts that it was an automatic faucet that looked like a handle. tricky... very tricky..."
3;"Cleanliness: 3 Stars\nThe front of the restaurant looks like the rest of it, everything was completely cluttered. For the volume this place and being a chain resturant the amount of people this place sees on any given morning I am disappointed by the food storage and prep areas..\n\nHospitality: 4 stars\nThe staff was smiling and greeted me with a welcome. Aside from being a snippy and trying to continently ask if \""That's It\"" after each item my experience wasn't bad.\n\nFood: 5 Stars\nThe portions are large and made fresh to order. All our meals were hot and came accurate.\n\nOverall:\nThis place is great for a \""quick\"" meal and more affordable than a traditional sit down restaurant. I would recommend to others looking for non-traditional Mexican food.."
4;I love food and the next best thing is wine. Winestore is great for many things, 1. Fun GNO, 2. Great service and understanding of wine - what I LOVE is that Ian and his team take pride in not only having great knowledge of wine but hard to find bang for your buck good wine. They carry high end and they carry great every day priced wine. You can sample wines and they have weekly wine tastings. I also had them assist me with corporate christmas gifts and it was seamless. I gave them a price point, which wines i've personally had and they recommended what was best fitting for my budget. Lastly, the customer service is always on point - they are just great!
2;My third visit b/c I love the views of Camelback at sunset.  I love the zucchini florets and the pasta tastes homemade.  I would have probably given four stars, but the service was blase'.  The prices are a bit on the high side.  We opted for Chelsea's Kitchen for dessert b/c it has been disappointing in the past but it looks like their adding desserts from Julia Baker.  WIll have to try next visit.
3;This TJ Maxx was recently renovated about 2 years ago, so everything is actually very well organized and clean for a discounted department store. The dressing rooms are brand new!\n\nWhen it comes to buying clothes, I prefer Marshall's over TJ Maxx. However, they do have a good selection of home goods here. They also have a pretty good jewelry section here which is NOT available at Marshalls, so this is a plus. When I say jewelry I mean sterling silver and chain necklaces and charms and pendants, not just fashion jewelry. They also have a good selection of purses here and beauty and hair products. \n\nOverall no complaint about this store! I have been frequenting this store for the past 5 years. If you need something for your home but do not want to pay the high price tag to get quality brand name items, check this place out before you hit up more expensive options!
2;This place was really busy when I was at the airport.  I needed a quick bite to eat before flying home and their menu had a good variety of items especially because I was on a diet.\n\nI ordered a shrimp burrito with veggies, it was actually pretty good.  Ingredients were freshly cooked, which took a bit longer than I expected but it was worth the wait.\n\nPrices are reasonable for the airport.  Service was okay.  It did take them 20 minutes however to get customers napkins!
3;One of my favorite seafood restaurants in Charlotte. Every time we have dined here, it does not disappoint. Start with the Crab Dip, too die for, and the Thai Crispy Calamari. As for the entrees, I have enjoyed multiple choices, lobster, tuna, and the halibut, all amazing choices! The service was good, but a little slow. Unfortunately it wasn't  nice enough to sit outside, but take advantage of it when the weather permits, great site of downtown and they have music on certain nights.  I will continue to enjoy Dressler's!
3;Fun place to take the kiddos for an hour. A bit on the pricey side but I'm sure the upkeep and food bill for the lions is probably pretty pricey as well. We had a good time.
1;Not the best place, but decent. Kind of like a fly over state but as restaurant.
3;I belong to this gym...  I live in the South section of Pittsburgh, and I find that this gym is not too far from me.  The staff is friendly, the equipment is quite good.  You get two free personal training sessions when you join.  They have lots of weights (which my boyfriend uses) and a decent cardio room.  The only thing I would say is to increase some of the cardio equipment.  Water is only $1 a bottle!
0;"One of the WORST experiences of my life.  My friends and I decided to go and check this place out as the local radio kept talking about it.  So the day we decide to go, the guy from the Colbert report was there mocking the restaurant also.  We go in and we thought, \""hey wow, this is kinda cool\"" as they talked about monster proportions of burgers and fries fried in lard.  However, once the food arrived we sat down and although the wait staff was scantily clad, all of them had \""cottage cheese\"" legs and thighs.  We sat down, and my friend decides to take their super burger challenge, she said if he finished his 2 lbs burger, his meal would be on the house.  He kills it, and when we ask why his burger wasn't free, we could no longer find out waitress and the owner says to us \""you either pay or i come over the counter\"" he threatened us with violence, which is stupid as all we were doing was asking what about what the waitress had told us.  We will never ever go there again.  Being Asian, he also spewed racial slurs at us, calling us to go back to where we came from.  ALL of us were born and raised in Arizona so I don't know where we would go.  Anyways, don't go here.  \n\nAlso, all of the patrons, ALL of them were middle aged men, who instead of paying attention to their wives and kids were hiding away at a nasty restaurant who's burgers aren't even really grilled.  the frozen patties from costco are placed on a machine that rolls the burgers through, so you can't even want a medium burger, they are all torched.  The fries although fried in lard, are crap.  All in all, if you're a lonely loser, this is the place for you.  If you're a classy kinda guy that wants REAL food, go to any other generic burger place and you will be more satisfied."
3;One of our favorite secret gems in the Valley.  Cheap, Par 3 golf.  This is a great place to take ladies, kids or any beginners to teach them about the game.  All holes are Par 3.  Every club is an iron.  It's not intimidating and easy for any level of play.  If you are an avid golfer, it's an 8, 9, PW & SW all day to improve your short game.
3;I've never heard of this chain, probably because we don't have any in San Diego, but I thoroughly enjoyed my food there. We got 50 wings, half Honey BBQ the other half was Spicy Garlic - both flavors were delicious. I like all the different choices of sauce you have for the wings. I also ordered the Buffalo Chips which we're also quite tasty. I also inhaled a cheesecake with raspberry sauce.\n\nThe beer was cheap, the service was great. Great atmosphere to watch games and sporting events. Lots of screens.  We were there on a Saturday and the college football crowd was in full effect.\n\nI'll definitely venture up to Burbank to check out the location there.
3;"Good quality \""new\"" American food with twists. Enjoyed this place a lot. Limited menu selection (for my tastes) is the only thing holding back a fifth star."
1;This restaurant was recommended by our hotel. It was our first night in Edinburgh and we were looking for a fun restaurant. We didn't have reservation but we were seated right away. The restaurant's ambience is very nice and lively. We were seated near the front door but I noticed that the better view is all the way in the back where you have a better view. \nI noticed that the servers were all very busy and always in a hurry. I should have picked up on it that service will be very slow. And it was. It took awhile for our food to come out. We were going to order dessert and asked our waitress to bring us the menu. We waited and waited and didn't get the menu. So we just decided to ask for our bill so we can pay and get out of there. \nThe food was not good. My boyfriend ordered the skirt steak and I had the pork belly with scallops. There was hardly any flavor in both. The quality of the meat used in the skirt steak was poor. We found much better restaurants in the area.
4;BEST. THAI. FOOD. IN. VEGAS! I've been to soooo many and am a tough critic with thai. I crave their fried spinach salad often and their curries are great, the drunken noodles are my FAVORITE!! Wish it were closer to my house, open more locations!
4;After being a frequenter of Carly's for the past couple of years, I'd gotten used to sandwiches that were tasty, but lacking filler, and a happy hour that only consisted of a dollar off beers. Womp womp. The area was in need of a good sandwich and salad shop with tasty beers and wines to rival it. So you can imagine my excitement when this place opened up... I love their homegrown feel and it is in the great Coronado neighborhood that I grew up in and am very proud of :) It is also officially the reason I don't really go to Carly's anymore... The Happy Hour features $2.50 drafts, aka, they offer danger :) The staff is friendly, the service is good, the menu ranges around $6-$9, yet features sandwiches with REAL ingredients on them. The Calvano, oh Mama mia! This New York-sized sandwich just makes my mouth water even thinking about it. I didn't know I loved sopressata before this sandwich existed. I always order some extra balsamic with my salad so that I can also add a little to the sandwich. Also, Mac and Cheese with EXTRA hatch chiles is the way to go for some extra tasty flavor. The salads are HUGE and DELIGHTFUL. Finally, three more words to sell you: Jalapeno cream cheese. Yes please, all over. It is featured on the TMI Toast and the Jive Turkey sandwich. They serve their food until midnight on the weekends for some late-night eats. The ambiance, flavor, the relaxed, yet on-it staff are the total package and a great addition to the neighborhood.
4;Took some guests from out of town for a nice dinner. VG came through. It was a delightful evening. Nice wine, good cheese plate, enjoyable salads and excellent entrees. My last visit about 6 months ago was probably only a four star visit, but this time Vintner stepped it up just that little, almost intangible bit. It was thoroughly enjoyable.
3;"The other reviews are spot on about the ambiance.  It's very frat house chic, with lots of crappy fourth hand furniture, flickering fluorescent lights and turkish news playing on the the big screen TV (WTF?) \n\nIt is a bitch to find, especially at night, so pack your gps.  Once you find the building, you have to punch in the code ( It was 0002 when I went) for the door to get into the lobby at least at night.  Once you're in the lobby, you have to go to the elevator and hit \""M\""  for mezzanine level.  There was no sign telling us to do that and the elevator wouldn't let us select any other floor without a security badge, so it took us a little while to figure out.  Once we stepped off the elevator, my friend was having serious second thoughts about the place because of the sketchy vibe, but I'm glad we stayed because the food was REALLY REALLY good.  \n\nI got a meat lovers pizza that was absolutely piled with pepperoni, sausage, ham,  and bacon.  It was really tasty.  My friend got the Lamb Shish Kabob which had some sort of magical spices on it.  It was like a circus in your mouth.  It also came with some kind of flat bread with sesame seeds which was really good.  \n\nThe location (second floor, over the river and through the woods)  and the atmosphere absolutely suck, but the food definitely didn't disappoint. I knocked off 1 star for sketchiness, but the place redeemed itself when our order came out.  If this place found a  little nicer location on street level, it would own."
0;Beautiful Boutique in a prime part of town, but not worth checking out. On their website they say they have other dresses besides consignment, they definitely do not. My consultant asked me a bunch of questions about budget, dress type and venue, then told me I had to go find the dress myself I wanted. Kind of defeats the purpose of having the consultant and needing the information from me. I grabbed a few dresses, all of which show straight forward they've been worn before and scruffed up. I honestly thought they were sample dresses because they had looked that beaten.\n\nOnce we got in the dressing room, the consultant casually handed me the dress and told me to get in it with no help or assistance but just to call her when I'm ready to be zipped up. This was my third stop of the day and the first consultant to do that to me. With the place being a consignment store, you would think they want their consultants to help bride's get in the dresses to save the dress from any extra damage, guess not. \n\nRegardless of this place being a consignment boutique, go somewhere with better customer service and with a consultant who will help you get into these heavy, expensive and sometimes complicated gowns.
1;We went here after reading many stellar reviews and hearing from friends that it was the best food in town.  First things, first the waitresses and hostesses were not very pleasant.  They hardly welcomed us in at 6:30 on a Sunday.  It was about 85 degrees out and the building doesn't appear to have AC which was clearly ticking them off, but as people who are trying to help them make money for the evening I was put out by their attitudes.  We decided to dine outside where our smile-less waitress continued to bus the table next to us.  Rather than taking the previous diners full glasses of water back to the kitchen she chose to hurl the water into the street while we were eating.  Now I know this isn't a fancy restaurant but along with the sour puss she wore the whole time we were there I found this to be rude.  The food was decent, but one of the entrees was over cooked.  When we didn't ask to box it she asked if there was something wrong and I told her the beef was really really tough.  She said she would take it off the bill and did, thankfully.  When I went in later to drop off the check she did finally come out with a little personality and say that she tried our dish and it was awful and that she was sorry.  All in all there wasn't anything that would encourage me to come back.
2;I was not terribly impressed with the place, to be honest. I'd read good reviews so maybe I was expected too much. I did NOT like the bread and olive salsa and was terribly disappointed not to have chips and salsa, since this is one of my favorite things about Mexican type eating out. I hate olives. The shrimp tacos were OK. I ordered a margarita and was not too wild about it. It was strong, which I guess is nice, but it was not very tasty and there was a LOT of ice involved. With so many other options for Mexican food, I won't go back.
0;This place sucks... My bf and i were kicked out by cops.... If u think we deserved it I WISH! it was so wack as FUCK!!!! Spent $100 on drinks and seriously got kicked out for dancing w my bf of 7 yrs....
1;Service was slow.  7 rolls came out one at a time over the course of 45 minutes so that no one really ate together.  At the end, a gratuity was automatically added.  We had a party of 5.  Never heard of an automatic gratuity for a party of 5, but then again, I have never had worse service.
1;Not a good experience.  Ordered a to go order for just one pho and stood at the counter for just over 10min before anyone chose to acknowledge me.  I said excuse me and was popping my head into the kitchen and everyone just stared at me.  When someone did finally acknowledge me it was to tell me the food wasn't ready yet.  Mind you I was quoted 10min and showed up 20min later.  By the time someone spoke to me 30min had passed since I ordered.  The pho was really good, but not worth the bad service I received.
3;My family and I so loved this restaurant.  It is not much to look at and the atmosphere is unappealing.  Also, it's a bummer that they don't have a liquor license.   That is where the negativity ends.  The food is simply delicious from start to finish.  My wife had a delectable spinach salad and vegetable curry.  I had the delicious spring rolls and sweet and sour chicken.  My daughters had the chow mien and it was all simply wonderful.\n\nOur waitress was so sweet, helpful and fun.  I am a serious meat guy and I loved this place.  I want to go back and taste meatless beef and other dishes.  I wish so badly we had a restaurant like this in Scottsdale.  Go here, you won't be disappointed.
2;"I have eaten here four times since I used to work in the area. The first three times were uneventful and dram free, as any lunch hour should be. \n\nThe Fourth and final time time, however, I ordered a meatball sub. I took one bite (or tried to) of it and the whole this fell apart. It was a mushy mess. I got up to exchange it for a sub I could actually eat. The \""sandwich girl\"" (I should have gotten her name) saw me standing there but waited on two customers before acknowledging me. I showed her my \""mushy mess\"" and she actually asked me what I want to do about it. Oh........those were fighting words, but I kept my cool. I told her I wanted a new sandwich, but NOT a meatball. All she said to me, without even looking up from the cash register was, \""I'll have to charge you .80 more.\"" Oh good grief...whatever. I handed her my credit card. The purchase probably cost Subway more in fees than it was worth. \n\nNote to manager: Train your employees in customer service!"
3;This review is for the Casino only. They have a good selection of machines for all budgets. The table games are usually at lower limits than the strip so if your on a budget your money will go farther here. The cocktail service is usually good even when they are busy. Cocktail servers Vasona, Sam(girl) and Diane are the best. The only downside is the place can get smoky when it is crowded.
3;Much different experience than some of the recent reviews. Stopped in for dinner. Cuban joint down the street was closed. Started off with Angel Wings. It is deep fried stuff chicken wing with sweet chili sauce. Never had them before. Quite tasty. Three of them was too much for the two of us. Next moved on to soup. We went for the Gai Tohm Kahn. Sweet and sour chicken soup with coconut. Turned out to be pretty spicy. Good for me, I like spicy food. Finished off our dinner with Rad Nahn with chicken. Big,fat rice noodles with gravy. Not spicy, but still good.\n\nThe service was good, the prices were reasonable, and the food was tasty. Would return.
0;Initially when I first got to this pho place I thought that it was going to be good based on how crowded it was.  I was wrong. \n\nI ordered spring rolls as an appetizer and hu tieu my tho as my lunch entr\u00e9e.  The spring rolls were just mediocre.  The sauce definitely needed improvement.  It was so watery and lacked a lot of flavor so I had to add more hoison sauce to make it taste better and that didn't help much.  The hu tieu my tho was NASTY.  It wasn't even made with hu tieu.  It came out with regular banh pho noodles.  The worst part of it was the fact that they added tomato sauce to the dish.  I found that to be pretty weird because NO ONE serves it like that anywhere else that I have been.  \n\nThe place was busy and they were extremely understaffed.  I had to request for water twice before they actually brought anything back to my table.  I don't recommend this place to anyone.  It was my first time at this place and I definitely won't ever come back again.\n\nThis place should be called Pho Not So 1!
4;Chizona's is awesome. The atmosphere is great, the staff was really friendly and helpful the first time we went in, not to mention the pizza is a delicious traditional Chicago style, which is hard to find around here. I have yet to try the chicago beef, but it's next on the list. Fantastic spot.
1;I love the idea of this aviary but the execution seems poor.  The signs and displays were outdated and not accurate for what was actually there.   We spent an hour there and I honestly can't see how you could spend more time than that because this place is pretty small.  The wetland and rainforest rooms were really nice, but it was difficult to know what we were looking at because the idenitifcation for the birds was not visible.  For the price of $10 per adult I expected more than this.  I am not sure if we will be going back.
2;"The only reason I liked this place was because of Maryanne. Maryanne moved to a beautiful salon on el captain And flamingo! Her number is 425 260 7973 ;)"
1;Very poor service today. I've always heard good things about Kabuki, but the service was terrible. It took forever to get drinks, which is even worse on 105 degree day in Vegas. I will say the lunch specials are tons of food, and tasted pretty good, however the crappy service killed it for me!
0;"Me and my bf Madison F took our son here today for the \""food festival\"" and \""full carnival\"" as they described on their website.  We didn't see any of that all we saw was disappointment in our son's eyes.  We were all very very disappointed.  \n\nI expected more vendors, but their wasn't many to choose from and there also wasn't a lot of variety of different asian food. We decided to go with the korean bbq and it really wasn't that great. I got the pork, my bf got the spicy chicken and my son got the chicken. I tried all 3 and wasn't  impressed with any of them, and for the amount we paid the food should have been spectacular. \n\nNow on to the the \""FULL carnival\"" what a joke! there were maybe 10 rides at the most and 6 of them were super kiddy rides (our sons 5) and two were for 52 inches or taller my sons 48 inches. The wrist band was 25 dollars but we chose not to buy that and just buy tickets seeing that there wasn't that many rides.  We bought 40 tickets for $35 dollars and we didn't even use them all because of the limited amount of rides.  Oh and we go ripped off by some toothless redneck at one of the carnival booths we totally misled us which was the icing on the cake. \n\nI really expected more and am very disappointed that it wasn't put together a little better, please don't waste your time or money here."
4;Hands Down Better than the Phoenix Zoo!\n\nI'd never really heard about this zoo until I got coupon in the mail, but I went today for the first time and don't know who had more fun - me or 2 year old daughter! \n\nI like the Wildlife World Zoo better than the Phoenix Zoo because overall it's less crowded, you can get closer up to the animals, and there are a lot more interactive exhibits. You can actually enter the kangaroo pen and walk on the path with the kangaroos lounging just feet from you. We got to to pet a bunch of animals today including the sting rays, giraffes, goats, baby deer, and llamas.\n\nThe newest exhibit at the zoo is the aquarium and it had some beautiful fish and a lot of different species. The sharks are still really small since they're babies, but nonetheless they were cool to watch. We got to see the black footed penguins at feeding time and they were so cute I wanted to take them home with me!\n\nWe didn't eat there since the food was pretty expensive, but the menu at the Tiberon Restaurant looked pretty good. They have a buffet for $18/adult if you're looking for a big meal. \n\nIf you're planning to go on a weekend I suggest going early - they open at 9 on Saturday. When we left at 12:45 there was a long line to buy tickets and a lot more people walking around the park. I'll be sure to go back again when I have visitors in town or want to teach my daughter more about animals as she gets older.
0;I'm not changing my review, but in fairness, after reading my post a manager from the restaurant contacted me to apologize for the food and gave me a full refund, which is pretty great. She offered me a free dinner at The House of Blues here in LA. Haven't had a chance to take her up on it, but if I do I'll report back.
4;"Yeah. This was pretty much AWESOME.  \n1. Do take out and eat outside in the park.\n2. Get the meat \""medium.\""  It has a little bit of fat on it still, but it's flavor is UNBEATABLE."
2;"This review is pretty late. Just clearly out my camera. \n\nWell I went to watch a Suns game here with my brother. Driving up to the area was very easy. We didn't hit our first problem til we got out the car - tickets. I purchased tickets online and was told to go to the ticket booth to pick up. \n\nI go to the ticket booth (where I was directed) and wait 20 minutes in that line to get to the front to then be told I need to enter another line for tickets? Another 10 minute wait and I finally have someone see my name for tickets. But there are printing problems? Why wasn't this done beforehand? \n\nOnce we find our seats the game was pretty (bad). But great seats and courteous fans. (Atlanta can learn from these folks). The Center is okay for it's size and quality. I got great drinks and food from the main floor. Of course overpriced but that was to be expected. Comparing this to Atlanta - there is a lot in need to be upgraded. But the location, parking, and amenities make it \""Just Okay\"". I wish the Suns would just play better ball."
2;"Despite a couple of bad reviews on Yelp I decided to check this place out for this first time since it's so close to my house. It is absolutely gorgeous inside and everything seems really clean. \n\nThe manicurist did a really good job, my one huge complaint is that he was super fast. It took him less than 30 minutes to do a full gel manicure. Normally I am all about it being a quick process but today I actually had some time and I felt like he just rushed the entire process. He barely let my nails dry between coats so I am a little worried it's not going to last very long. I've had gel manicures that took double the time. \n\nOverall, I would probably go back because it seems like he did a good job, just would like someone who was a little less \""rushed.\"""
0;I am a salvadoran-american so I know good salvadoran food when I see it...\nhowever this place just does not meet my standards for good salvadoran food in fact i spent my after-noon throwing up after visiting this place..... I could never get desperate enough for salvadoran food to come here No,no,no .... Pupusas from here are EXTREMELY OILY just not appetizing at all ... The yuca frita was also disgusting OILY FOOD FOLKS DON'T COME HERE
1;"I brought my son and couple of his friends here after for the first time after a movie. When I first walked in I must say it was an impressive sight. Lots of redemption games and the familiar cluster of noises reminded me of that an arcade is supposed to be. \n\nBut my son and his friends were more interested in the e-sports room, particularly in Mario Kart on the Wii U. When we found out they hold Mario Kart tournaments he was super excited. But concerned parents BEWARE!!!!!! These events along with many others are hosted by an outside person. So like any responsible parent I did a little research on this person who I will leave anonymous. Although I have had no interactions with this person personally, based on some of the vulgarity he posts on Twitter and watching some of his videos, I do not know how a large company like GameWorks could associate with such a person. He is not only unprofessional on his social media but also has no concern for censoring himself around younger people during hosted events it seems. My son was disappointed when I told him he could not attend any of these events but I feel it's my responsibility as a parent is to not allow him to come to these events based on the personality involved. Perhaps these events are geared more for \""adults\"" then it shouldn't be kid games or GameWorks should do a little more research on who they have working for them."
1;I could not catch a break for nail salons on Thursday 2/27/14. I went in here after a horrible experience with service at the My Nail Spa across the street. The service was great in the fact that they were all pretty pleasant. BUT I got a polish change and it literally looks like a 10yr old painted them. They're very lumpy and blotchy. I explained this to the tech that did them and she immediately told me they're fine. After sitting under the dryer a bit I told her again, yeah no they don't look good to me. And she said that it was because they were still wet....now I'm no nail tech, but I've been getting my nails done for YEARS and hearing that they look like crap because they're  wet was news to me. Mind you, it's now Friday and I'm certain they're dry and guess what? They still look like poo. I'm torn between going back and asking them to fix them, or just going to my normal spot and never trying out somewhere new. I'm sure they either won't fix them or they will talk about me the entire time. -.-
0;"This place is just all kinds of BAD!  \n*Smells terrible!\n*Casino is claustrophobic as all hell!\n*Endless rows of penny slots frantically being played by people in fanny packs and matching \""What Happens In Vegas...\"" t-shirts.  \n*More children running amok than parents to corral them.\n*A KOA Kampground out back?!  Are you kidding me?!?\n*I can't even imagine what the rooms look / smell like!\nCould not get out the door fast enough to avoid feeling like I needed an immediate shower.\n\nThe only thing that could possibly make it even a tiny bit better is if the valets were dressed like clowns......except the cars would run over their big shoes."
3;I had celebrated my birthday here with my family, we were totally of 13 in the group.  I had called earlier in the day to make the dinner reservation and we were accommodated easily. \n\nThe prices were great for a large party under a budget.  The food came out, our party ordered different dishes and I liked mine (Peppered Steak).  Mine was beef and cooked perfectly , very tender.  Everyone liked their food very much, service was great (even though there was only 1 server), the mango with sticky rice got praises.\n\nThe only thing that I noticed that needs a little bit of improvement was the temperature of the food.  The rice were not steaming hot and so the other dishes when it came out and served to us.  None of my party noticed it as we were all chatting away while waiting.  But I did noticed it, as I'm very observant one and the foodie in the group.\n\nBut I will definitely come back here again when in the area.  I had chosen this place as it was closer to my relatives who lives in the Enterprise area.
0;This review is based on Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. This buffet is terrible compared to what it was even a year ago. On Saturday, we arrived at 1:30 and there wasn't a line. That was a first but the lobster was at 2:30 so we weren't worried.  The food was cold, the kalbi ribs were so tough I couldn't cut them without a struggle.  They listed something like bbq chicken legs as a special for the holiday. This turned out to be the regular fried chicken without the breasts and thighs.  The crab legs were cold and cut in half. The kid in charge said that this was because too many people got hurt eating them before. Overall this place has gone downhill, it used to be great,  now the desserts are the only thing above average. What we had should have a price around 12 to 15 dollars, not 34.
0;Poor service, bad food and cheap setup. By the way price is no cheap. I wish I'd gone to Waynn and paid 10 dollars more for the dinner. I should have taken pic of the deserts to show what I mean... Filthiest desert I've ever seen, didn't even bother to try.
3;This is a good sized park, looks like you can rent bikes here as well. Great place to be on a sunny day, lots of people, families, and dogs!\n\n\nNext time i go I think i'll try out the greenway connector nearby
0;"I can't quite understand why so many people like Buffet at Asia. My wife and I tried the Rainbow location a year or so ago and it was absolutely revolting. The serving areas were messy, the food overly greasy and unappealing and it all just felt extremely cheap and low-end.\n\nPerhaps I am picky because I come from Australia where we can get amazing Chinese food (sort of like how in the US you can get great Mexican due to the proximity to Mexico). The fact that I don't eat fish or seafood of any kind didn't help either - The place was VERY heavy on the seafood.  Vegetarians won't he happy either, unless you are one of those fake \""vegetarians\"" that thinks fish are vegetables.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin for us about this place where the signs on the walls saying that due to wastage, if you left any food on your plate you would be CHARGED EXTRA FOR IT! I mean -really- part of the beauty of a buffet is that you get to OWN the food and decide what to eat. I don't want to have to clean up my plate for fear of trouble with the management. I'd be interested to know if this ludicrous policy is still in place, but I have no desire to ever eat here again and will never know."
0;Ohh yelpers you have let me down..  I came here based on the high reviews and left disappointed (I didn't even finish my ramen).\n\nThis place is super tiny & was packed!  I came when they opened and there was already a line out the door so I had high expectations.\n\nI had the:\n- Tonkotsu shoyu ramen (which has both pork and chicken broth). The broth was lacking.  It's salty but isn't rich.  The flavors are subtle compared to other places like Fukumimi, Daikokuya, and Men Oh Tokushima. ..and the egg in the ramen is a side option, so if you don't order it you won't get it.  The noodles were really different too.  They didn't seem like they were made from scratch.  Whatever it is, it's not what you typically have in ramen.  Also, the chaysu is pretty fatty so if you're looking to get some meat or protein in, you're almost forced to order something else.. or something else on the side!\n- Gyoza.  All 6 pieces were stuck together.  It really just looked like a whole bunch of frozen pieces were thrown in a pot so I wasn't too impressed - but they were YUMMY!  \n\nThis place may be good, but maybe for things other than their ramen.
3;Really good and tasty, but I prefer Luv It better.  This texture was just slightly less creamy and cold than Luv It.  I had a small oreo and it needed a touch more sugar to balance it out.  Other than that, if you're in the area, you wont go wrong stopping here.
2;The only thing I tried was the hot chocolate, which was good, nothing breathtaking .... the same as 7-11 to me. However the smell inside was AMAZING. The chocolate looks sooooo good, but VERY expensive. 2 chocolate covered preztels $5.75.....
2;"We ordered what they're famous for (gyros and fries) and...I loved everything about it, except the food, which was just okay.  The service was great, the staff were nice, but to achieve true greatness, I think the pita needs to be fried on the griddle with a bit of butter for crispy contrast, and the tzaziki does need a little zip, and even some cucumber.\n\nDon't get me wrong: this is a solid entry in the \""what should we eat for lunch?\"" quiz, but it needs a little more finesse to knock my socks off."
4;Seriously the greatest place to get Thai food in Vegas. Their soups are the amazing they have so many choices and you get a huge bowl! Tom Kha is best one. Thai iced tea delicious too. Best bang for your buck.
0;Wait time is awful! Always an hour or more. I walked out of my last appointment before even seeing Dr. Mannino because the wait had been too long. I've been coming here for over 10 years but now I think it's time to move on. No follow up on labs, no appointment reminders, not professional at all!
3;If you're going for something specific it's great. However, this isn't the sort of mall you go to wander through. It's got all sorts of stores and is vastly better than it used to be since it added on the 2nd row of shops and theatre and such a few years back.
4;The White Horse.\n\nYaaaaaaaaay!\n\nI've just moved to Edinburgh so stumbling upon a bar/pub that actually makes me feel warm and cuddly made my day yesterday. \n\nThe owner is amazing and I had a great time chatting to him and some of the regulars that popped in. \n\nI've no idea what this place looks like on a Friday, as it was nearly empty when I visited this Thursday, but I intend to find out!\n\nGreat atmosphere, comfy seats, the man knows his beers (and there's no messing about with that!) and -not unimportantly- an interesting crowd!\n\nHeads up: they have a no-children/babies policy after 8-ish.\n\nI know where I'll be at this weekend.
4;Went in to start a new phone service and walked out of the store pleased with what I got. I was very happy with the service I received from Mitchell, who seemed very knowledgeable and was very patient in covering all I was asking for. I also appreciate Kalee's time and input in today's purchase. Thanks guys!
2;Kind of like Scottsdale meets Jersey shore.  Solid Italian American menu that is deserving of neighborhood patronage, assuming that you can deal with the added decibels created by the patrons and the layout.
1;It's just Ice Cream... 4 bucks for a 12 oz blizzard is crazy.. For that money I should have gone to a creamery and had something higher quality...
3;When the hubs and I lived in Vegas this was one of our favorite places, and I was bummed to see some pretty negative reviews when we were looking for a place to have breakfast off the strip on our most recent trip out there. We actually scored a groupon so we figured we'd risk it and we were so glad they did. We have been spoiled by many an independent pancake restaurant here in San Diego - but we are still huge fans of original house of pancakes! We loved everything about breakfast - it was delicious, hot, and surprisingly didn't take that long to come out even though they were slammed. (Saturday morning at 10:30 - it's really annoying watching people complain about the wait. Don't be surprised!) I'm obsessed with their cheesy potatoes - yummmm. I had chocolate chip pancakes and my husband had an omelet and we split both. I'm also a fan of their coffee and my cup never once was missing fresh brew (and I'm a fast coffee drinker!) for the families - this is a great place to go. They had a balloon artist going to different tables, it was so cute. The groupon made a delicious breakfast a great value and we'll definitely come back next time were in Vegas!
2;This place is alright. Parking is so crowded you need to valet. Food is all pretty good. I've tried flat breads and burgers. The service inside is great, and because of this I'd happily come here when it's not so crowded (lunch or weekday dinner). However, on weekend nights it is disgustingly crowded. Last night we thought we'd try out the patio. Big mistake. There is a bar in the middle of it so that is the focus. It smells like a frat house, like beer spilled on the floor long ago and smoke (Is it legal to smoke in restaurants in AZ? Yuck. Is this 1985?). I wouldn't recommend the back patio unless you're trying to relive your frat days.
2;"The ambiance is very nice.  Restaurant is clean and nicely decorated and appeared to be a bit more upscale than other restaurants in the area (there really isn't much to choose from out here).  Water was served in plastic \""glasses\"" which seemed a little strange to me for such an upscale place.  We both ordered the Twisted Merlot wine and when it came to us, it was COLD!  I have never been served Merlot that was obviously being kept in the cooler.  It is a really big No-No to serve Merlot in any other way than room temperature.  Why don't they know this?  The bread was very dry and cool.  It may have tasted better if it had been warmed.  I had a house salad that was served with a very sweet dressing that I guess just comes with it as I wasn't given a choice of dressings by the waitress.   My husband had the caesar salad that was \""okay\"".  I ordered the Sorrentino which was very tasty and a lot more food than I could eat and my husband had the Chicken Marsala which he said was \""okay\"".  We wanted to give this place a try as it is very close to where we live, but if we want really good Italian food, we will travel much farther to get it."
2;Could have been better! I thought the place was Closed because of the DIRTY glass front of the restaurant. Food is okay. Service is alright. A couple of Flies did some Fly bies\nwhen I was eating. I stared at a Dirty duster behind the counter Gross! You guys have potentials just Clean the Place! Not very Appetizing specially early in the morning when most of us would like to have very Good start on the Day!
2;"The Brioche french toast they're advertising now is amazing!\n\nService was quite good; I've been here before and it isn't always good.\n\nClean enough.  Decent prices."
2;Glad I wasn't looking forward to eating here, or else I would have been really disappointed. The decor, ambiance, and service was of course amazing (as in all the restaurants in the Bellagio), but the food (mainly the steak) was not on par. I had the ribeye wagyu steak and it was the worst I have ever had. It was strange, some of my pieces would be really dry and then other pieces would be overwhelmingly marbleized and fatty. I couldn't get a happy medium piece. The soy based sauce that came with it helped it a lot.\n\nOther than that, the stone crab appetizer I had was very good and fresh. I didn't like the seared foie gras (I prefer the smooth spreadable kind, this was the lumpy really livery looking kind). I had a taste of the butternut squash soup which was excellent. The mushroom side was perfect, but the truffle mashed potatoes was lacking in truffle. For dessert I had the poached pear and the coconut souffle. The poached pear dessert seemed a little bland to me. The souffle was really good and it was nice to have a coconut variation of it. I don't think I will find my way here again (sticking with CUT next time).\n\nwww.anitaeat.com
2;Great simple bar. Servers have a heavy hand which is always welcomed. Food is better than decent for bar food. Cheap drinks, usually a good crowd. I hadn't been in almost a year and they all remembered how I took my drinks. 3.5 stars.
4;I live here and don't go to too many shows, but my son and I are P&T fans, so I took him for his birthday.  I paid full-pop for the tickets.\n\nThe show was awesome.  I would recommend it to anyone.  The coolest is that they stay afterwards to meet, take pictures and sign autographs for EVERYONE who wants to.  That speaks volumes about how much they appreciate their fans.  A couple of real class acts with a class act.\n\nI understand they update and change their act regularly, but I don't know how often.  I would like to see them again.
1;"Meh. I've experienced better.\n\nThis is just a continuation of my previous review.  I had a due-out from it, so please read it as well for a total picture.\n\nSince this was a separate visit as well, let's talk about it in brief.  A burger is something I would expect any self-respecting BBQ place to do well.  Granted, to make one, it requires grilling, and not BBQing.  I guess this establishment just considers it beneath them to care about something as benign as a burger.\n\nIt's hard to excel at a burger, but it's also hard to mess one up.  Well, let me tell you of a few ways to lead down the wrong path as demonstrated here.  First, don't ask me how I want the burger done.  Typically if a burger is cooked beyond medium, it's because they're using an inferior meat.  Secondly, burger preparation is supposed to be minimalist, but not lacking entirely.  A waft of seasoning is all that's required, but I guess that doesn't work if all the burgers are the same preformed base for each menu version.  Thirdly, don't cook the heck out of a burger.  Luckily it wasn't fast food bad, but it was definitely poor workmanship.  Definitely not worth the price.\n\nThe hushpuppies didn't strike me as fresh, and they didn't have any semblance of being hand-made.  Yet, they did provide a medium in which to test their sauces, which I forgot to do on my first visit.  Their Original is far from its name-sake as it can it.  It takes just about like ever other BBQ sauce I've had (keep in mind I'm not a fan of any though).  The Red Sticky just seems like their Original mixed with some ketchup and maybe more (brown) sugar.  I honestly can't say if it made it better or worse.  Lastly, my \""favorite\"" of the three would be their Spicy.  I wouldn't call it Spicy as in picante, but Spicy as in at least they put some spices in to give it flavor.\n\nI guess I should have ordered some of their slaw to remind me why I risked another visit in the first place.."
2;"hmm, what to do on a Thursday night in November?\n\nGo to XS? Boo, we got there and it was closed!!! So we ended going to Tryst as a second choice.  We arrived there around midnight, and got in without any problems--of course it was 6 girls! Once we walked down the stairs and got to the cashier, we were like \""we're not going to pay $20/person!!\"" So we decided to leave the club, and then the guys who were managing the lines earlier stopped us and escorted us in for free! (yay to girls in Sin City!!)\n\nI wonder how clubs get away with discrimination! So Sexist!!\n\nThis was my second time at Tryst--nothing has changed since the last time I was here in 2009. I am just surprised how crowded it was on a Thursday night. I am not too sure the clubbers knew if Lil John was going to be there, but ,my girlfriend spotted him when he walked in!!! \n\nThe decor is nice, and the waterfall where the DJ is makes it a lot nicer; w/o the waterfall, Tryst would just be any ordinary club in SF."
2;"Definitely a step above Roberto's/Alberto's/other 24 hour \""mexican\"" fast food that ends in \""O's\""\n\nThe fish burrito is a highlight. Surprising, I know. The battered fish remains nice and crispy, and the burrito tastes nice and fresh. It is something you can order any time of day and still be able to function after eating. \n\nThe carne asada fries are built with some of the best fries I have had at a place known for tacos and burritos. The portion is enough for 2 to share. \n\nIf sloppy, huge portioned Mexican fast food is what you are looking for, I would definitely try here first. 24 hours with a drive through or walk up window for all you night owls."
3;We really enjoy Krua Thai.  Its a small place and never super crowded.  The food has been reliably delicious.  My husband prefers Krua Thai to Sala Thai, but I'd maybe say it's a tie with overall experience being better at Krua and food maybe slightly better at Sala.
0;Nice open space.  Waitress needs to wear shoes not flip flops.  Ordered onion rings, but forgot to bring them to us.  We had a coupon for $7.99 fish fry, small three pieces.  The cole slaw was soggy, surprisingly the french fries were good.  Michael and I ordered gin & tonics, well drinks were $3.00 during happy hour.  You get what you pay for...they dont use the good gin.  We will not go back for the cocktails.
1;This place is open 24 hours so perfect to go to when you want something to eat in the middle of the night if you stay at Elara or Planet Hollywood. They have almost everything on the menu from omelettes to burgers, pasta, chinese food, soups, salads, and steak. Their ahi tuna salad and cilantro chicken salad is pretty good. I also always get their lemongrass soup, hot and sour soup, or egg drop soup. Their food is decent and they always have deals going on like breakfast specials, all you can eat pancake specials, happy hours, etc. throughout various times on certain days. Their specials are actually really good deals because it is a lot cheaper. For example, they had a breakfast special when we went on a Friday morning. The breakfast special ended at 11am that day and the steak and eggs was only about $6.99. \n\nHowever, the service here is terrible! The waiters take  long time to acknowledge you have just been seated. When you have already placed your order, it takes forever for food to come to the table. I've been here when the restaurant was full and when the restaurant was empty. The wait for our food took just as long when it was empty. They also forget to bring you things when you ask for extra sauce, utensils, water refills ,etc. \n\nOverall, I come here because of convenience, the food is alright, and I'm usually not in such a hurry. I'ts just frustrating sometimes that they take forever and forget requests.
3;Yellowtail Tar Tar! Need I say more?! I could eat this all day. ALL DAY!! \nI came here quite awhile ago so I can't really remember all that I ate but I DO remember THAT much. Just come here for that!! Nom nom! \nOooh and the sashimi was VERY good too! Fresh and delicious tasting! \n\n\n\nI think they keep getting shut down by the SNHD though so......
1;I'm a basic kind of salad person and eat a Cesar salad 90% of the time, one reason I get romaine lettuce and not iceburg or the bitter greens.  Salad works base salad mix is romaine and iceburg, a cheaper way out.  There were 2 people ahead of me in line post lunch hour rush (1:15 pm) and it took me 15 minutes to get my salad.   The young lady in front of me (yeah we waited long enough we had a conversation) ordered a turkey melt panini and says she loves their food and comes back often.  The greens are fresh as well as the chicken in my salad (and not dry).  So try it and maybe you'll like it,  I'm not impressed.
0;Bug in my veggie sandwich from the bar :(
3;This little hole-in-the-wall is a great find!  It doesn't look like much on the outside, but the food was great, and the prices were very reasonable. \n\n I ordered the teriyaki chicken combo, which came with fried rice, crab wontons, spring rolls, and egg drop soup.  Even with a large drink it was still only $9.50.  I made two full meals out of it with more leftover.\n\nI was able to choose between white and dark meat for the teriyaki.  The sauce was tasty, and everything was cooked fresh to order.  The wontons were still dripping and steaming hot from the fryer, and the fried rice was filled with fresh-cut veggies.\n\nThe egg drop soup was kind of a miss for me.  I thought it was a little bland, but everything else more than made up for it.  The couple that owns it seems to be the only staff, and they were very courteous, polite, and genuinely made me feel valued.  The place was dead, which was a little sad to see, but it made for a pleasant, quiet meal.  \n\nI'm glad to finally find decent teriyaki in the neighborhood, and I will most definitely be back for more.
2;I get my nails done here .. But olny thing about \nThis they don't do super cool nails like they do in LA\nno cool design or nothing .. I wish this shop would \nGet all the cool shit for nails.. Not just for old lady's
4;We rode the Harley last weekend to Casa Grande to have a look around.  There is not a lot of selection for breakfast so we ended up at Dennys.  What a surprise we were in for!  The place was clean, the service was truly amazing!, the food was very good.  If you read my reviews you know that I am picky when it comes to eating out.  \n\nThey did a great job and we will be back!
3;Vegan Co-op with great food and awesome people! We were lucky to have a friend in Montreal show us this place, because we would have never discovered it on our own. It made my traveling vegetarian heart very warm and happy :)
2;Rick Orr florist is closed. He apparently retired last year. The phone is being answered by another florist.
2;This place is ok. The venue is small and the wait is long. You literally have to be there when they open which is around 1100 to not wait in line. Anime Ramen is a better choice than Monta Ramen. They have more food choices.
4;"My family and I have been eating at Spinatos for over 20 years.  We've followed them all over town, to each location.  I would say with 100% certainty that this is the best pizza ever.  We love the family who owns and runs the restaurants.  They are great people.\n\nWe were excited to see the new Ahwatukee location open.  We were loyal to the Tempe location, but this new one is closer.  I love what they did with the old Chili's.  It is beautiful!  They really did a great job. \n\nWhile my review of 5 stars is for the Company as a whole, I have to say that this new location is not my favorite and I probably won't return. \n\nThe food is amazing, that is not a problem.  I could eat Spinatos pizza and food everyday for the rest of my life.\n\nBut this location lacks the family feel that I'm used to.  On both occasions that I've gone here, I've received poor service.  The wait times for a table are grossly underestimated.  I was told 30 minutes (at an off peak time), and it was 65 minutes later that I got a table.  Our waters were never refilled and we didn't see our server until we flagged her down to get our check.  \n\nWhile this location is beautiful and I'm so happy for the family, I won't be back there.  I'll keep going to the \""hole in the wall\"" Smith location in Tempe where I'll actually see some of the Family, and get the amazing food and service that I've grown to love over the last many years.  \n\nI"
0;For leaving me BEREFT, Luigi's, and without delicious pizza, I give you ONE STAR.\n\nI hate you for closing.
4;The best sushi in Pittsburgh.  I go here for my birthday every year.  The only authentic Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh.
2;St Leonard's Land is very well known to students of the University of Edinburgh. It has a swimming pool and is home to a gym and other sporting facilities. It offers good rates for membership as well. \n\nHowever, what most students won't know is that when this building originally opened in the 1970s, the main gym hall was described by one commentator as a 'Neo-Fascist gymnasium on the south side of Holyrood Road - its flights of steps a test of fitness!' Now, some students might have these thoughts when they are taking exams in the large halls in the building, but this was certainly not my first thoughts when I saw this building! \n\nThe building is one of the more modern ones in this area and is situated right across from the Moray House School of Education campus. It is only a five minute walk from George Square campus as well.
0;"I've had their pamphlet for several years now but never manage to order from them since their prices were far more expensive than the competition in the area. Last night, basing myself off incredibly positive reviews on Yelp, I finally decided to order food from Vimont Pizza.\n\nAnd what a mistake.\n\nThe order process went smoothly and we got our pizzas within 30 minutes. \n\nExcellent.\n\nI knew from the moment I had the pizza in my hands that this was the extra greasy Quebecois styled pizza experience. Now, before you tell me, \""You don't like the Quebecois style pizza\"" and blow me off, it is true that I enjoy the thin crust, ingredients where it matters, Italian styled pizza but I've enjoyed Quebecois-styled pizza for a long long time as well and a few restos in this area do this job quite adequately. (Pizza 2 pour 1 for example - and its far cheaper)\n\nThis type of sogginess went beyond the norm however. The condiments as expected were stacked onto the dough and the grease went right through it all, in fact it soaked and went through the pizza delivery box and I needed to cover the bottom of the box with the other box (which was less greasy).\n\nMy wife ordered the all dressed and I ordered the Hawaiian. The pineapples on my pizza weren't fresh and eating them individually made me realize that this was most likely canned pineapple as fresh pineapple being baked with pizza would be far more aromatic and flavorful. The pineapple barely tasted of anything. My wife's pizza was just as bad and felt uninspired.\n\nWe also ordered some onion rings along the pizzas. We love onion rings! Now, one would expect our onion rings to be fried and be somewhat crispy even after delivery but it was still soaking in oil and had no crispiness (or heck... flavor).\n\nAll in all, this meal was a complete fail and we both barely ate half our 10 inch pizzas. Normally, we'd have scarfed the whole thing down.\n\nThen I felt ill to the stomach and then proceeded to puke half an hour later. My wife felt queasy as well but she ate less than me and survived the night.\n\nJoy.\n\nMaybe this was my experience with their delivery dear previous Yelpers who gave 4 and 5 stars but you have seriously let me down. How could this pizza be so goddamned bad? It's pizza cripes! The worst you should be able to do is OK pizza, not send your clients hurling into a toilet bowl.\n\nCongrats to Vimont Pizza in getting my first 1 star rating.\n\nNever again."
0;The restaurant isn't overly clean inside.  The main sushi chef couldn't be less friendly.  However, the 2 for 1 specials are compelling.
0;Wow, what a disappointment.   Pizza appeared to be their specialty and we went with a nice four topping pie and the $7 house salad to split.   The pizza was the equivalent of a bad frozen pie.   Horrible.  We ate one and a half of the 6 slices and could eat no more.   The waitress mentioned a new pizza cook that day but did not offer to comp this mess.   Oh, and the salad was the pour out of a $1 bag variety with a pile of shredded carrots on top.   Don't waste your time on pizza.   Could not comment on any other food at this place and never will as I won't be back.
4;"Best place to eat breakfast in Phoenix, bold but well deserved. I stumbled across this fine establishment one Sunday morning and wasn't disappointed one bit after eating at local breeze. \n\nThe fire island eggs were amazing and complimented with a little green Tabasco sauce added the perfect touch.  The patio is huge and open creating the perfect setting for some sangria or mimosa whichever you prefer. They also offer a \""going green incentive\"" with 15% off for bike riders on Sundays. \n\nKeep doing what your doing, because its right!"
4;I Went in to look at a few pistols and the staff was excellent. Had great knowledge of their inventory and was very pleasant to talk to. I did buy a pistol from them and am very happy. I will go back for my next firearm and highly recommend this gun store for anyone.
3;Very good car wash by hand then wax by hand prices range anywhere from $13 to $200 depending on what you want everybody in Vegas likes a clean shiney car
2;It is located inside Paris Hotel and Casino in a lively, old European setting.  Le Provencal's walls are covered with murals of the French countryside.\n\nThe restaurant is a little pricey.  I'm glad I gave this place a try.  It was a pleasant experience and a fairly good meal. Make sure you bring your Total Rewards card, because almost all items on the menu are discounted by $1.
4;Descriptive phrase: fine-dining small plates.\n\nI looked for any reason not to give Eno 5 stars and couldn't find one. Wine list and libation selections were varied and plentiful. Space, though located in an unassuming suburban strip-mall, was surprisingly posh. Service couldn't have been more spot-on. And the food, mmm the food.\n\nI was lucky enough to come with 6 other people because we had the chance to try nearly the whole menu. Some items were better suited for 4 or 6, but everyone got at least a taste of everything.\n\nStandouts in my opinion were the Chorizo Stuffed Piquillo Peppers, P.E.I. Mussels, and Portabella Mushroom Ravioli. If I had to pass on anything it'd be the Green Beans and Tempura Shrimp. But really, even those were still tasty and well-prepared. \n\nEno Vino is one of those places you should expect to dress well and pay well, but you'll definitely get what you came for.
1;nice mall, very deceiving. looks small from outside (like everything in vegas) and really opens up. RA Sushi outside, is great and has an amazing happy hour. some pretty unique shops and the las vegas 'regulars' like luis vetton or however you spell it. good fun place to walk around at. WARNING it is not as fun of a mall as the venetian, ceasars, etc. it  is a pretty normal mall. so if your all mall-ed out by the time you make it up that far on the strip, eat at RA and head on.
2;e really liked the atmosphere and how they have kept to the character of the church. Four of us went for lunch on Sunday. The service was ok though we were confused about who our waiter was because it seemed it was someone different all through our time there. Can't say it was great because they didn't even keep  my water glass refilled and when they finally did (after being asked) I didn't get any ice. \n\nWe LOVED the salsa that comes with the chips. Just the right blend of flavors and quite unique. It was also nice to have the different sauce bottles of varying heat but really not necessary as we are now addicted to their salsa. We tried five different tacos with mixed reviews. The chicken and the lamb were good, the veggie and the beef were okay and the fish was awful - very fishy tasting. It said it was snapper on the menu but I have never tasted such fishy snapper. My sister had the veggie burro and that was pretty good. The side of rice was so-so but the beans were great. We also had the prickly pear sorbet with berries and liked it.\n\nThe owner?/manager was quite friendly as was the staff. This is just a preliminary review as this was our first visit. Since we just bought a house in the neighborhood, I'm sure we'll try them again - if only for the salsa and the beans!
1;I was hoping the food here would be cheaper than everything else in Las Vegas, I guess I was wrong. I was starving and paid $3.99 for a hot dog. At least the hot dog was decent.
1;Food wasn't good. It had overcooked hamburgers and undercooked fries. Server was sweet but not very good. Only plus was milkshakes above avg and food came quickly.
3;"I have known about this place for years, but just went for the first time last week as a default when we discovered that the Big Fat whatchamacallit place across the street had closed. What a nice surprise. The staff was very friendly although they hovered a bit too much for my liking. The food was spectacular, and as a vegetarian I had a lot to choose from (although the menu needs some help; things marked with an asterisk are supposed to be vegetarian, but there were asterisks dotted all over fish dishes). The array of desserts was to die for. My main complaint? Pricey like woah. And it was sneaky pricey. There were three of us; our main dishes were $10-$12 each, with a $9 appetizer, 3 desserts, cocktails, etc. and the bill was over $160!!! I thought my poor boyfriend was going to crap himself.  I honestly don't know how it got that expensive. The drinks? The desserts? Were the baskets of pita $8 apiece? I mean, a Greek meal costing  more than a steak extravaganza at Cork and Cleaver? Come on. While all three of us just loved it (a rarity, as we are all differently picky), at that price, it's going to have to be reserved for special occasions. Sheesh!"
4;Somehow I had no idea this place was here. I thought it was new and asked the guys how long they have been open and they said 2 years. Darn, I've been missing out, but not anymore! \nThe service is super great, friendly, and have great customer service. \nMilk tea with boba was delicious with just the right amount of ice to keep it cold, but not watered down. I'm excited to try their food and other drinks. \nWill definitely be back instead of driving to chinatown for a boba fix.
2;I came after dinner with a few Yelpers to sit and have drinks. \n\nI originally wanted the Baklava-tini but then our server said they didn't have martini glasses and it would be a wait so I got a mojito ($10) instead. It was alright, but a bit heavy on the citrus element. Our server was friendly though. \n\nThe table shared guava mango hookah ($15). Even though I lost my taste for hookah smoking a long time ago, I knew this wasn't premium tobacco and when I saw them lift up to replace to coals that there was quite syrupy stuff in there so it's probably a type of mu'assel, possibly even not tobacco based but herbal based but I would have to open the foil to really tell. It had a throat feel that I think I've grown to not find enjoyable. However, I don't deny the flavor tasted good.  \n\nWe went during Raggae night and there was a live band playing. It wasn't too loud even though we were right in front of the band. Lots of people were having fun and dancing so the vibe in there was good. \n\nI wouldn't say I would come to seek this place out, but if I'm around the other side of town and my friends want to smoke, I don't mind accompanying them.
2;I had the beef taco plate with a Mexican coke. Very good, will go back next time I am in the area
1;I am unimpressed. This is not a welcoming coffee house. There is nothing cozy here.\n\nI am on a constant hunt for good chai. I didn't find it here. I know the company Cartel orders their mixes from makes a spicier chai. Based on other reviews it's either not ordered anymore or was ordered by accident before. The chai was pretty much all latte and hardly any chai.\n\nThey will pretty much assume any drink you order is to go. Not surprising because who would want to sit around on the ridiculously uncomfortable chair things? They are literally concrete blocks with bent metal for a back and a thin pad for the seat. Steal a pad or two from other chairs and don't try to lean back. Ouch ouch ouch.
3;Excellent food enormous plates efficient service elegant decore all at a economic value and open till midnight. Will eat there again and again
4;What an incredible experience! Celebrating our one year anniversary, my girlfriend and I decided to indulge in something a little out of the ordinary. From the moment we sat down we were greeted warmly by our waiter, Tony, who gave us the history of the buffet while popping a fresh bottle of French champagne. (He promised our glasses would never be empty, and he definitely kept this promise.) At first glance it seemed like every thing was going to be delicious, and the food absolutely did not disappoint. Unlimited Alaskan king crab legs, lobster tails, filet mignon, sushi and other staples from BLT steaks menu were available from the buffet and we were also served Lobster bisque, tuna tartar and caviar by our waiter. And then when we thought it couldn't get any better, the desserts were just as decadent and over the top, some with gold leaf shavings, but all were so delicious. Overall it was an incredible experience that I highly recommend to anyone looking to do something unlike anything else in Vegas! It may seem expensive but seeing what you get for the price, it does make sense. A big hats off to Tony our waiter for making the experience that much more enjoyable! Looking forward to our next trip to Vegas just to get to eat at the buffet again!
2;Last time I was on a duck tour , I was in the Wisconsin Dells. As a recent resident of Pittsburgh I decided to take my son and brother on the tour. I was excited and did what any yelp elite would do..... I ran straight to yelp to check the pricing, hours and reviews. I'm glad that I steeled my nerves to what I feel are somewhat high prices.  Exhibit A. A just ducky tour ticket is $22.00 for 45 minutes of action. A child's ticket is $15.  While the tour is cute and cheesy the guide started mentioning tips with 10 minutes  left in the tour. Tips were mentioned several times and I found it to be distracting or perhaps in poor taste. But I guess that's how people hustle.
4;"I absolutely love this place and truly wished I lived closer. I am a big fan of outdoor malls and there is something for almost everyone here. I say almost because there is only one store that my husband is interested in shopping in. But...this review is about me not him! ;) For me, I love the mix of more well-known clothing stores and local boutiques. I love that there a number of different restaurants to suit your taste in addition to the cheaper eateries such as Paradise Bakery, Chipotle, ColdStone Creamery, etc. In the summer, they have the misters going and in the winter, it is the fireplace. There is also a Harkins movie theater. Apart from the middle strip of shops, I like that I can hit up a Target, Ulta, BevMo in one stop. Who cares if I need to drive across the marketplace, the key thing is that I don't have to drive across town to find shops that are all in one place...so convenient. I don't get the parking complaints from other reviewers. How is that the fault of the marketplace? There is an over-abundance of parking spots, but it can be hard to find a spot due its popularity. If you are a bargain shopper, you can go to their website and print out coupons for its shops. My husband and daughter got BOGO frozen yogurt from Mojo Yogurt today. There is also a little splash pad in the middle of the shops that is great for the little ones. This is a great place to cover anything you might need."
2;"I am writing this review from a guest's perspective.  I rated this a 2.5, so I bumped it up to 3 stars because it was \""A-OK.\""\n\nLocation: It is a pretty place, but there are some interesting things concerning the surroundings that one should be aware of.  First, it's surrounded by homes. on two sides, directly bordering the guest parking lot as well as the back side of the \""orchard\"" section where ceremonies take place.  I assume photographers have to be pretty creative to keep homes from showing up in the backgrounds of photos.\n\nAlso, there is a bird sanctuary bordering the reception hall.  You can hear birds squawking quite easily.  As we took our seats for the ceremony on the lawn, I noticed that several seats had \""presents\"" from the birds.  It's a wonder nobody received such a present while sitting.  \n\nThe ponds are a strange orange color, with absolutely no pizazz.  The water sounds so nice, but the ponds just look so basic for a wedding venue.  It would be nice to see some decorative touches, lights, pebblestones, something.  They seem so empty and cold.  And beware, the bridge that crosses over the pond and the ramp that leads to the gazebo are made from a very slippery, plastic type material that does not work well with heels or dress shoes.  I saw 4-5 people slip. \n\nCeremony: The wedding we attended had an ultra short ceremony, it literally was around 10 minutes.  The entrance of the bridal party and bride was done very well; they come from opposite sides and walk down a path.  The music for this wedding took place through speakers mounted outside the reception area, so it was turned up quite loud and sounded cheesy.  Also, when the bride was given away to the groom, the music continued to play.  The Reverend (Jimmy) gave it a moment to stop, and when the music continued, he literally screamed out for them to \""SHUT IT OFF!\""  Way out of place at a wedding, in my opinion.  He was very laid back (I think he may have even cursed a time or two), so if you aren't into the traditional/stuffy kind of ceremony, I guess he would be a good choice.\n\nPersonnel:  Least friendly wedding staff I have ever come across.  The food servers and bussers were robotic and quiet.  The bartender was the least friendly, most arrogant bartender I have ever come across.  The DJ was boring.  The wedding coordinator was a total grouch with a perma-scowl.  Every staff member seemed ultra annoyed.\n\nReception Area:  The dance floor is a nice size.  The bar area is tiny.  The food serving area is small.  The bathrooms are small and cramped.  The plates, silverware, glasses, etc., are old and well used.  The place smells like bleach.  Almost like they have to go through buckets of bleach per week to keep the old mustiness of the place at bay.  No doubt about it, the reception hall is aging and needs a facelift.\n\nFood:  The food was served buffet style.  It was just \""ok.\""  There was nothing special, unique, interesting, etc.  It was edible and it was fine.  It felt like the food you throw together in 15 minutes on a Monday night.  I don't believe that \""boring\"" should be anyone's goal when it comes to wedding food.\n\nDJ:  During the 70 minute timeframe where guests were waiting for the wedding party to finish photography outside, the DJ played at least 5 songs twice.  And then after the wedding party made its entrance, some songs were played again.  I don't know if he forgot to \""turn off\"" repeat or what, but it quickly became embarrassing.  He wasn't very good at getting people involved or pumped up.  Yawn.\n\nTL;DR: I think this is a fair option for a wedding on a budget.  I think this place is missing the \""spark\"" that a lot of other wedding venues have, from budget-friendly to extravagant.  It feels a little bit like an old, tired, \""wedding mill.\"""
2;Cute spot with outdoor seating on the upper wrap around balcony. \nGrilled octopus and french fries with white wine made for a great lunch and pretty reasonably priced.\nService was quite friendly and there was no problem doing separate checks for a large group (a really nice options found in most Montreal restaurants with the portable card readers...NYC needs to get on that stat!)
1;We were excited to stay at the golden nugget because of all of the reviews on help. However, we were very disappointed. Our stay started when half our party arrived and the system had crashed. The front desk told them they had no reservations saved from this and they were able to check them in because they were there - other reservations could not be held. Thankfully they allowed them to check us into our room, because when we did arrive the hotel was booked and we would not have been given a room. Prior to our trip we called twice to request rooms on the same floor and this did not happen (one on 11 and the other on the 19th). They did tell us we could switch rooms in the AM and to call down and we could move. We called down in the AM and the front desk told us the room was empty and needed cleaning but would check us into the room and when we came back into the hotel to pick up keys. We did exactly that and there was no record of our new room and there were no open rooms on the 11th floor. They thankfully never checked us out of our 19th floor room.\n\nAlso, wifi was $13 a day and coffee, a bottle of Figi water for $7 and 4 Kcups for $10. What a rip! \n\nNeedless to say the staff just didn't seem happy to be there or want to help the guests. I'm SURE there are nicer and better places to stay in Vegas - and even if it was a good deal for the hotel it is worth a little more money to stay somewhere else!
2;The dim sum appetizer platter was good, the orange chicken was ok. My husband couldn't chew the beef in the hot pot and had to spit it out. All of the beef in the pot was super gristly with chunks of what looked like just tendon or cartilage. We googled it and that's how its supposed to be, it just wasn't to our liking, so not their fault. When they saw we didn't eat it they took it off our bill.
1;"Had dinner this weekend. Have to admit that I haven't been there in a year+. Nothing I had \""wowed\"" me. Scallops were OK but they were on the small side and could have had a better char on them. Appetizers of duck confit was tasty but the pork and brisket Mac n cheese was disappointingly small and not very cheese. Drinks were good but vodka on the rocks and a glass of wine shouldn't be that difficult to accomplish. \nI'm sure it will be another year+ before I return."
4;"Returned to Discount Tire again to have another set of wheels and tires mounted and balanced with TPMS, and to make things worse they were aftermarket 22\"" wheels that needed bands to mount the TPMS correctly. \nThe two gentlemen to ask for when you go in Anthony or Colton, as on my visits both were professional and nothing short of a pleasure to work with. I know my car isnt the easiest to work on but never did i get a sense of irritation or unwillingness to do the job the right way for me. I know in most cases thats not saying much as its to be expected, but the way you get treated at many places... its amazing people still have their jobs in this city. So thumbs up to Discount and the crew that works here. Thanks, you have earned my trust every time."
4;Damn \n\nDamn this place was good\n\nDamn I went here honestly thinking it would suck and I would be writing a bad review\n\nDamn I was wrong\n\nThe hubby and I cruised on in Sunday night and were seated right away by a very friendly hostess. I like the decor and layout - very cool. I think red is just damn sexy period!\n\nOur server was very nice and friendly  - between the busboy and her, we were well taken care of. \n\nSushi was killer - it ranks with the best places I have ever enjoyed the take of the sea. I suggest the Palm Roll and the spicy scallop and shrimp....okay everything we ended up ordering was perfection. \n\nAnd damn, the manager even came over to check on us and we had a very nice chat with him. \n\nDamn I was wrong\n\nDamn I can't wait to go back!
1;I checked out this place with an Eversave deal. I ordered the teriyaki chicken lunch special. It tasted alright, but I left hungry and ended up getting a salad at McDonald's after I left. There was maybe 3 oz. of chicken on the plate, but I really think it was closer to 2 oz. The rice serving was about 1/2 cup. For around $8 I expected more. I'm glad I didn't pay full price.
3;Very reasonable, good food. We had breakfast--good eggs, fresh salsa, fabulous tortillas. The only negative was the plastic silverware--it was too flexible to cut easily.
1;We had a 9 people in total. This place is very large but NOT setup to have a party larger than 7 at a single table, -1\n\nThe place was empty on a Monday night, which might be expected, which was perfect for the enjoyment of the conversation - not sure what it would be like normally.\n\nThe menu options were nice and it was difficult to decide. I chose the Kobe Flat Iron steak, medium rare. It was a tad over cooked but very tender - as I would expect. The flavor was a bit lacking. \n\nThe apps are not really made to share. Though they were good, they need more 'group friendly' apps, -1\n\nThe deserts sounded creative and flavorful - on paper. I guess it is the magic of the English language BUT that magic could not make them taste good. They were below average, at best. -1\n\nThe entree's do no come with any veggies - only starch sides. They did provide some nice greens when I asked. I try to eat healthy so green veggies are a must - no salad is not enough.\n\nWine selection was good but that is no trick in Vegas, or anywhere else where just the dinner will be min $50 per person. \n\nI would not likely go back here... based on the price/flavor ratio there are FAR BETTER.
4;This is a great steakhouse. The service was great. The food was delicious. I tried their filet and it was absolutely perfect. I wasn't as hungry so I ordered the ahi poke. I loved it. I also highly recommend the truffle tater tots. SO YUMMY.\n\nService was good, only I will say it did take a fairly long time to get my meal. That won't affect my rating this time though because I wasn't in a hurry thus I wasn't bothered by it.
0;Went to dinner the other night and the service was horrible. Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes. The waiter was talking to other staff like we didn't even exist and the manager there is clueless.  Would definitely not recommend and this is not the first time this has happened.
4;I love icy stuff.  Slushes, Italian ice, Slurpees, etc. are all good to me (in varying degrees).  While I have been meaning to try this place since it opened, I somehow never got around to it.  Well, today I was moseying on by with a little bit of a sore throat and it suddenly became a NEED.  They are located in what I am positive used to be some sort of automotive-y shop or something similar.  I remember driving by the building and wondering why it hadn't been demolished.  Such an eyesore.  Now Pelican's is in there, and they have painted it (BRIGHTLY), and revitalized this little building that otherwise would have been razed.\n\nAnyway, the most difficult part was trying to decide on a flavor, since they have over 100!  I went with peach and it really fit the bill.  I really love how small the crystals are.  The prices are outstanding, as well.  I intend to bring the kids often this summer!
1;Did the Freddy VIP Wash - was OK.  Windows definitely were not clean which irritated me. Smeared inside and out...I still can't get them clean on my own. They didn't even dust the dash or wipe it down -guess that costs extra? After paying $16.99 with a Yelp $3 coupon..disappointed.  Outside looked good - excellent wheel dressing...but that didn't make up for the unclean windows, dash.  Not sure I will go back again for the money - there are much better places for less money.  My 4th time here since living in LV - seems to be getting a bit worse each time.
2;Taco Tuesday.\nFast becoming an institution in the landscape of Mexican food eateries. \nOnly if you decide to come here, brace yourself. \n\nFilibertos has a ninety-nine cent taco that's enormous and, from outward appearances looks and smells delightful. \nOrder two and a cup of water. The bill will come to just over two bucks. \n\nNow, take a bite out the the first taco and let the disbelief envelope you. How could anything that looks so good taste so bad?\nTry the other. Yeah, no, it's crap too. \n\nOnly one thing left to do.\nWrap them up and take them back to the office to feed the stray that's been threatening to disembowel you upon your arrival at the job trailer each morning.\nYes, I think you'll find, as I did, these tacos make a wonderful peace offering, allowing you ample time to open the gates and get safely inside the office before being brutalized. \n\nAnyway, the shell is cooked to perfection. I ate some of it along wit the lettuce and cheese. \nHowever, a weird thing happened while nibbling at it. \nWhen I picked up the taco to take a bite, in the typical taco-eating manner....listing to about 75 degrees, my lunch buddy interrupted my bite by droning on about something. \n\nBeing the friend I am, I perched the taco close to my mouth and held it for a brief moment, all the while eye-signaling him to shut the fuck up so I could take a bite. \nHe continued talking.\nSo now, pretending I was interested in what he was saying, I sat the taco back onto its plate but while doing so, I noticed a puddle of oil had managed to drain from the damned thing.\nAnd it wasn't a small puddle. \nThis was a three to four inch diameter puddle even BP execs would have admired.\n\nSo unless you find yourself in a tight spot with a threatening animal, or, you have a penchant for all things oily, there's no need to try the tacos here. \n\nPer my previous review, just stick with the bean burrito.\nI think you have to work really hard to fuck-up beans.
4;I love love love this veterinary facility! My dog is a nervous dog and the staff works together so that she feel safe! I have never seen that and it amazes me! When you walk in you are greeted by the friendly front office staff who are professional and warm.  The office is very clean and organized. The vet techs are easy to talk to and great with my dog. The first time I scheduled an appointment with Dr. Amanda Simonson, she introduced herself to my sister and I and then introduced herself to my dog. Ever since I have been bringing my dog here! My dog has been groomed here and she has come back outstanding! Her nails are well clipped, she comes back smelling good and well brushed. It is extremely convenient that they are open 7 days a week and that payment plans are available. My dog feels comfortable with being here and hands down the best veterinary facility in Phoenix!
3;Great Wal-Mart and always clean, good at keeping stuff in stock. Wish they had self serve check outs!
2;Breakfast take out from here is a great back up plan now that Graze stopped doing hot breakfast during the week.  The toast isn't as tasty, but the service is spot on and comes with a smile -- which is important early in the morning. \n\nHits: Call ahead ordering \nMisses: Nothing to report. (Can be a wait for seating, but that's a good thing as the years of quality has built up a loyal client base.) \nHints: Ask for no butter on toast, unless you really like butter.
1;The interior of Graze looks very nice, so my initial impression was a good one.  We came during brunch, and we only waited about 10 minutes for a table.\n\nTo start the meal we ordered cheese curds.  They weren't bad, but they definitely weren't worth $9.  My boyfriend ordered a bloody mary and I ordered a beer to drink.  The bloody mary was mediocre.  I wanted to have a burger, but the burger is served on an english muffin.  I asked if I could have a bun instead.  The waitress then informed me that buns would not be available for another hour when brunch was over.  My boyfriend wanted a sandwich, but the honey wheat bread was not appealing to him.  He was informed he could not make a substitution on the bread though.  We then decided to just have the cheese curds and drinks, since the options on the menu weren't appealing to us as is.\n\nWe had been done with our food and drinks for 15 minutes before our waitress came by with our check, and we actually had to stop her when she was walking past to get the check.  The people next to us didn't get their check until right after we got ours, and they had been done eating before we even got our cheese curds.\n\nThis was a very disappointing dining experience.
2;Perhaps I was being just a bit unfair in my review of--wow--five years ago.  On its own merits, this Starbucks is a pretty nice place.  Oh sure, parking is a bit limited and seating is a bit tight.\n\nBut I was meeting my mom here before heading over to the Manor for a movie.  Because we both walked here at a non-busy time, the parking and seating weren't issues.\n\nOverall I'd give this Starbucks a 3.5 star rating.
1;"I guess since im not a native from Arizona I dont see the big whoop in Cerreta Candy. \nThey have some chocolates, they some caramels, they have some nuts. \n\nWe did the tour through the factory and it was nothing special. The first 20 people in line got to actually learn about the candy. The rest of us got to walk by it and if we attempted to stop and look were told \""OK! Let's move on people\"" nice! \n\nI would say the best tasting was the caramel."
1;I don't know why people would go to buffets when there are so many unique restaurants out here in Vegas. Anyway, my party decided they wanted a buffet and majority ruled. The food was OK. The selection was poor in comparison to other buffets and the quality was substandard. I got jipped! $20 for OK food? On the bright side, they do have this awesome Koi pond that makes mine look like a cheap fish tank.
0;Can you give zero stars, cuz that's all his place deserves. Will not come back.
1;I have only been in the once, the decor outside enticed me in and inside it looked pretty good as well, but the drinks were just the same as any other regular pub. I ordered some steak pie which had a generous portion of tasty meat, but the pastry was cold and the veggies a bit lame. The staff members were all really nice though.\n\nIf you are looking for a regular pub experience that you would find anywhere else, but with a slightly more interesting decor outside and in, here's the place.
0;Nice to look at, does anyone actually buy anything here? The only time I ever went was to eat at the Italian restaurant. They don't have hardly anything in the way of stores... this place is the perfect example of what happens when someone with loads of money fails to manage their property properly.
3;The Mussel Inn offers great food, competitive prices and a superb location. I came here the other day for the fabulous lunch deal where I chose a bowl of mussels with fries and a glass of white wine for only \u00a37.50, what a bargain! Service was really quick and I think that this menu is designed for people of their work break so the fast service ensures they get back on time, how considerate! The mussels were amazing if a little bit messy to eat, but I'm really messy anyway. The portion was large and the red pepper dressing I opted for was amazing.\n\nWe sat outside and I actually felt like I was on holiday watching all the people walking along Rose Street, it was a glorious day!
3;We had patronized this restaurant shortly after it opened and regretted the experience. It seemed time to give it a try again since it has some good reviews. Things are much better.  We had a good lunch. We ordered the prosciutto and fig pizza and enjoyed it. Interesting flavors. The prosciutto was good. The crust just the right consistency. We started with two small salads. The chop salad was good. The ingredients were well mixed and good flavor. The only problem with the arugula and pear salad was the pear wasn't very ripe. We had the nutella dessert pizza. Everything tasted good though ice cream would have helped. Lots of good wine by the glass. I particularly liked the primativo which was a very good flavor and went well with the pizza and dessert. Obviously there is a following as there was a good crowd for lunch. Service was adequate. The only problem was after salad our cutlery was removed, we had no silverware when the pizza arrived and there was no sign of the waitress. She returned soon and saved me from swiping someone else's knife and fork. Good experience. I recommend it.
2;As others have said, I don't want to go into details, as part of any Cirque du Soleil show is the experience.  Between my wife and I, we have seen five Cirque shows and each of us rated KA as least favorite.  That is not to say that it is bad by any means, but given O or Love, we didn't feel it was worth the price.  Ultimately, I am glad that went, but won't attend a second time, as I plan to with other shows.
1;Brads is cheap and the fish and sides are all frozen pre-breaded. I pop thru the drive thru every now and then because its cheap and easy and on my way home.\n\nThe catfish is OK. it's thin and flat? Never saw a flat catfish before. Not a lot of flavor. This is normal for Brad's trust my ex used to get the fish and fried zucchini all the time. I do like their tarter sauce it is tasty. \n\nIt's weird if you go in they have all of these display cases to sell you trinkets from Asia. But looks a little like a cafeteria. They have everything fried you can think of. Fish, shrimp, chicken, mushrooms, zucchini, onion rings, fries you get the idea. \n\nIf you want great catfish go to Honey bears on central Thursdays or Fridays only.
0;This place  is OFF my list. My husband and I went on a Friday night for dinner. The place was very busy. We were seated and waited at least 10 minutes for the waitress. We ordered and waited patiently. Everyone around us was getting their food more than 25 minutes later...we were still waiting. Finally someone came by and asked us if we had ordered. Give me a break!  I saw her go to the chefs who seemed to have misplaced our order sheet and were going to START  making it. At this point  we just left. The service is beyond deplorable.I suggest you look elsewhere for sushi.
4;This is a hidden gem. Tucked away in a plaza, this place has very authentic food. The best part is-- they serve chinese and italian food! The pastas are delicious. They also have a sushi bar!\n\nNear midtown Phoenix, this place is great before a show or sports event.
0;A pretty bad burger...  a burger should never come out wet.....  the bun was literally soaked.  I was very disappointed
3;"Went here for lunch today. I got the Greek Wrap with pesto tofu (hold the olives, please!); delicious! $5 for the wrap, $2 more for two sides and a drink. They seem to be emphasizing organic and natural food and they gave me a compostable plastic bag to hold everything when I asked. \n\nBetter value and food than Subway (the next closest place to get a sanwich) hands down."
4;"Wife and I stopped by after car shopping tonight. We tried some amazing dishes tonight. If you get a chance order this. It's not on the menu but it soooo yummy. Aki the Sushi Chef calls it \""The Flying Nun\"" It's Bacon wrapped around a nugget size of chicken breast with cream cheese and get this Mash Potatoes and deep fried and rested on a bed of greens in Mustard sauce. I usually don't like cream cheese only on my bagel or cheese cake bu when its combined with mash potatoes it's a perfect combination with the bacon and chicken. Ok here's the other one that was a highlight of the meal \""Baked Mussels\"" you get 4 on a plate. It's baked with a dynamite sauce (I think the ingredients are spicy hot sauce, mayo, and ketchup). When talking to the waitress Chieko, she told me one of the most popular appetizers was \""Creamy Mermaid\"" - it is shrimp w/cream cheese stuffed in wonton skin and fried. My kids like Combo 1 which is chicken teriyaki, Tempura, Kara age. It's really good. Toshi is the kitchen chef and makes the best chicken. He does not over cook the chicken and he does not under cook it. It's perfect. Tender, not tough it is soft and juicy still. This is very hard to do if you ever tried to cook chicken with different thickness. The Tigers Eye sushi is really cool. It's not on the menu just ask for it. If your feeling really adventurous behind Aki is this small white board with some specials of the day. If you ever want to check out skill of a sushi chef order the Tamago. It's basically egg but the thing is it requires great skill to make it. Also the taste sweet but not too sweet. order it try it. Thats a pretty good thing to order and check out the skills of the chef. Ask Aki how he makes the egg."
2;Hotel - okay. Comfortable beds and nice rooms (depending on which you get to stay in). Large bathrooms with double sinks and hot tub with separate shower but small toilet room. \n\nRoom service is decent. I'd definitely love the eggs benedict with (real) crab. Chicken wings are very good as well. Large and meaty.\n\nPool: very family oriented so if you are looking for single people to meet, don't come here. There is a 21 over pool where women can go topless but it's way too expensive and I don't think many people come here.\n\nCasino: Not bad but tables normally aren't under $10 during a slow weekday. \n\nBuffet: okay but not great. Not a lot of choices but then again in Vegas meals can get pretty pricey really quick. So $25, ain't that bad.\n\nCons: long lines when checking in or out. When I stayed here this past weekend, the computer system in the hotel was going through a complete overhaul and they weren't able to bill directly to my room. Bars are small and not very packed at all. This place was good about 10 years ago but not anymore. \n\nI've never really had a bad experience here though.
4;"I think the people raring this place low, are Westmount workers / residents  And perhaps former clients of Kaizen who are unfamiliar with this\ntype of sushi restaurant. \n\nThe location is what use to be one of MTL's most popular and higher end Japanese restaurants : Kaizen Sushi House .\nKaizen was one of our favorite restaurants when I was growing up so I understand the disappointment one might feel if they walk into the same space and expect something more traditional or upscale. \n\nUnfortunately if you know anything about the food industry, you know it's impossible to do what Kaizen did at the price / value of Crystal Sushi. So for this reason I think the reviews are unfair. \n\nI've been to most all you can eat Sushi places in MTL, and this is one of my top 2. Its definitely fresh, the service was friendly and efficient, the lunch price is awesome and the location is accessible, clean casual, and fun to be in. \n\nIf I were to say one thing to be improved on , it would be a wider variety of sauces and or \""flavors\"" BUT this is how they keep the prices so low and can offer such fresh produce I guess so...once again it's definitly at the top of it's game for it's kind."
3;"Keeping it simple, Yogis Grill is an excellent choice if you're in the mood for sushi or other popular Japanese dish (albeit Americanized), but don't have the time or money to eat at a fancy Japanese grill.  \n\nThe 4-Star rating is not comparing it to a high end sushi/Japanese restaurant, but rather comparing it to others in its own class.\n\nThe service was great; we weren't rushed.  The facility is well kept and clean.  We got our food in a few minutes after ordering, which is a huge plus over the typical 15 minute wait for sushi.\n\nThe food was surprisingly good.  We ordered a teriyaki chicken bowl and two different sushi rolls.  Honestly, it wasn't bad!  \n\nHere's what kept it from being a 5-Star (in its class):\nThe soysauce was watered down and the wasabi was weak.  \n\nOverall, a surprisingly good expereince for a fast food Japanese restaurant.  I'm sure I'll find myself here again when I'm in the mood and in a rush."
0;This review is for the taco stand in front of Reyna's, which is run by the same owner as Reyna's and Casa Reyna. Note that this is *not* the same stand as the one around the corner on 21st Street, across the alley from Pamela's.\n\nI got an order of three tacos from them on a cold day a couple weekends ago. The meat was cold before I could start eating it, and I assumed it had just cooled off quickly. \n\nWithin a few hours everything I had eaten was leaving me in a hurry. I felt sick and weak for the rest of the day, and was better (and completely empty) the next morning.\n\nNever going back, of course. This doesn't directly reflect on Casa Reyna's inside restaurant, but since the same people run it, it makes me worry about their food handling standards.\n\nI'll probably keep getting Reyna's big bag of chips when I need them for a party, but I'm never eating any other prepared food from them again.
4;Love this place! Seriously, the best raised donut ever. I wish my diet would allow me to indulge more often because I would be here every weekend.
2;My first time here...\n\nCrust- very good except for the center which was a little bit soggy, see toppings\n\nSauce- almost non-existent, I think it was good, just barely any at all on the pie\n\nToppings- canned vegetables :( and too much cheese, hard to believe but the combo of the excess cheese and canned veggies caused too much moisture and the center dough just couldn't cook\n\nPlease use fresh veggies, a bit more sauce and you will earn 5 stars!
4;I LOVE this Jazzercise with a passion! Jeri is AMAZING and really has a way to make all her Jazzercisers feel comfortable. I am new to Fountain Hills and went to a class for the first time. I LOVED IT!!! Such a great workout...and not boring (like at the gym) Jeri keeps the energy high and makes the classes VERY enjoyable! Time went by SO fast!\nI absolutely LOVE IT!!! Cant wait for my next class!\n:-)
4;The team here is efficient and very very professional!  This is a great place.\n\n1.  Location - Southwest corner of Trop and Pecos, very easy to get to.\n\n2.  Parking - Not much, perhaps a total of 10 spaces for three stores there.\n\n3.  Ambiance - A typical Subway.\n\n4.  Food choices - A typical Subway, with all the normal meats, cheeses and veggies\n\n5.  Not Typical - What sets this place apart is the quality service.  Just three days ago, I was at another Subway in Henderson ordering a sandwich platter for a meeting and so I have something recent to compare:\n\na.  Meats - I think they are controlled by this, so nothing special.\nb.  Veggies - They really packed these on. Compared to the Henderson one, they went all out.\nc.  Service - I was there at 11:15 and one person was before me. When I ordered the platter which is 5 sandwiches,  Then, 5 people came in immediately after me, so they had a very busy time. Immediately two others came out of the back and started helping all the other clients. Excellent way to manage client expectations and a busy load. \nd.  More - They even asked me if I wanted another sandwich for 5.00 more as it will pack the tray that is reserved for the mustard and mayo packs. I did do this and it rounded out the platter nicely.  At the henderson Store, they did not ask and I did not know and the tray looked a bit empty to me and not a nice way to impress the meeting.\n\n\n6.  Overall - The service here for a chain was tremendous. I recommend this place!\n\nGK says check it out.
0;Place a $100 order in person with Candice @ 9:30am in the morning. She told me the driver comes in @ noon and will be delivering the orders then. I call @ 1pm and she tells me it's in the processes of being delivered and it will arrive by 3pm. (Curious how my order of fruit and chocolate will do in a vehicle for over 2 hrs) I call @ 3pm and I am told by Candice the order is in the store and she will deliver it. I tell her just cancel delivery charge and I will just pick it up. ( I live about 2 miles from the store) Once I arrive I ask how long it has been here when she tells me it has just been finished. I didn't appreciate getting the run around. I have been ordering from that location for years and never had an experience like this. I will be ordering and just picking up the order from another location in the future.
1;This review is for the nightclub:\n\nBottle service sucks because there is no separation between you and the bar/dance floor.  At 2PM they close half the place and kick my party our of our two tables to one.  That sucked.  Service was only eh..     Really really crowded on a Friday night, I did not feel safe.\n\nNothing special (except the decor) about this club, go across the street to the TI and go to a club with some breathing space.
0;This Courtyard Marriott singlehandedly cheapened my image of the Marriott brand. \n\nSlow draining tubs, worn out fixtures, renovation dust, musty smells, and chaotically placed hand written signs guiding to the make-shift front desk as the lobby is being renovated make this a not-visit-again.\n\n$169/night? I've had better rooms for $39. You would do much better at a Super8, or Motel6. Same free wifi, and at least you would get a free cup of passable coffee and a styrofoam flavored waffle.\n\nAnd the train tracks 1/2 block away make it a noisy sleep.\n\nSo all of the things I look for in a hotel - failed.
0;"Uh, yeah, this place. . .\n\nWhile my wife was on the search for a good nail place in the Valley to replace the one she used to go to in San Francisco, I took her here a few times.\n\nThe first visit seemed okay--nothing bad, and they did a pretty good job.  On the second visit, the attitude seemed to change.  My wife picked a blue color for her toes and some of the techs seemed to be laughing at her.  Maybe we were mistaken, but their attitude seemed really strange.  The job that they did on her seemed okay, so we gave them the benefit of the doubt and just assumed that maybe that maybe they were laughing at something else.\n\nIt was the third visit that really surprised us.  We walked in early one weekend afternoon and my wife asked for a manicure and pedicure.  The owner told us that he was full up and could not take her at that time.  When we tried to schedule an appointment for later in the day, he simply told us no, and would not schedule one, not even for a future date.  No explanation, no courtesy, just no.\n\nWe got the hint.\n\nNow, my wife goes to Colorful Nails in Tempe when she wants to get her nails done.  Always a smile, always great quality, and always happy to get our business.  I'm not sure what the deal is with this nail shop, but we will not \""come for nails\"" there again."
3;Very friendly and approachable!\n\nI Just LOVE going into just about any Mid-First location, but this was great.\nThey treated me like a king, and helped me with my debit card issues in a thorough, effective manner.  \n\nParking can be difficult, as it is in the middle of downtown, but if I already have other business there, such a pleasure to stop by!\n\nThank you, Mid-First!
3;"Quaint restaurant in Dilworth with outdoor seating.  Close to the light rail and easy access to Uptown.  Eclectic atmosphere.  Great brunch location.  Due to its popularity and being one of the top 25 \""Breakfast Joints\"" (Zagat.com - USA Today), they are offering it everyday.  Some of my personal favorites:  the butterscotch scones...OMG I could make a meal off of these alone.  Bananas foster french toast is totally a dessert!!!  The hummus is the best I've ever had.  They also serve sandwiches, wraps and salads including numerous healthy vegetarian items.  For wine drinkers, they have an extensive wine list (over 200 selections).  Enjoy...."
3;cheap chinese food here, large portions, there dumplings here are very good. 10 for like 5$ or something. good deal. There chicken cashew was okay, F/R is good. everything else was good, but nothing else stuck out that amazed me. There sesame chicken was edible and taste good, but they could do better.
1;Expensive and small drinks (drafts seem to be 12 oz, and wine is sparsely dispensed in interesting glasses with a little bit of red liquid at the bottom). Nice outdoor seating area and a hipster interior. We had dinner there once, but made the mistake to order salads instead of their better looking pizzas. The salads consisted of oily dressing drenched wilted salad leaves-a sad experience-much in contrast to the trendy locale. Bottom line: little value, great looks, eat pizza if you must frequent this place.
4;"Bed Bath & Beyond for Boys! \n\nIf ya got a little bit o' geek in ya, this place is fun! They've also got very competent staff (at least in the computer section). The geeks and near-geeks out there know how frustrating it can be to talk to a tech support person at BestBuy or on the phone with some big chain only to realize that you know more - much more - about tech than the \""tech support\"" person. Yikes! I consistently find that the tech people at Fry's know their shit. Very refreshing.\n\nEvery time I find myself strolling the aisles of CPUs, SSD hard drives, hydro cooling systems, WiFi-n and WiFi-ac routers, I get a warm fuzzy feeling, and I'm not eager to leave. I suspect that this is what it feels like for the fairer sex to roam the aisles of Bed Bath & Beyond, or Michaels, two stores I want to leave as soon as I enter.\n\nSpeaking of tech support, I recently bought parts for a gaming PC online and ended up with a bad CPU socket on the motherboard (bent pins). I brought the parts into Fry's and they cheerfully built my broken PC for me for $50 (plus the cost of a new motherboard). They were fast, competent, and very fairly priced.\n\nNeed a geek fix? Nothing comes close to Fry's.\n\nI hear they sell other stuff, too, like appliances, Macs, iPads, smart phones, TVs, chocolate bars, etc."
0;I was HIGHLY disappointed with this place. I have never been treated so badly in Las Vegas in my life, especially with me being a girl. \n\nFirst of all, we weren't even planning to go to their club but their promoter kept pushing it so we agreed to give it a shot. I've only been to the Bank at the Bellagio and that place sucks so I was willing to give this a shot. When we got into the hotel we were stopped by another promoter which I guess was the promoter for the Bank and he kept pushing it and we kindly declined and asked where Hyde was located. At that point he was EXTREMELY rude so that didn't help and I shot back with some wise comments which are too inappropriate to repeat on here and stormed off. \n\nSince it was me, my other female friend and our guy friend we just walked up to the front and showed the bouncer our passes. He smiled and told us we would get in right away. However, right when he saw our guy friend he asked if he was with us and we said yes and instantly his demeanor changed and told us to get in line. I was absolutely disgusted. I have never had that happen before and I have never had to wait in line to get into a club in Vegas before. Pissed off, my female friend and I went to a different bouncer who wished me a happy birthday (it was my birthday weekend) stamped our hand and let us in eventually. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone and the club wasn't even that great anyways.
3;"Man, do I love snapping into a Pink's hot dog!  I've been to this one in Vegas and the Universal City Walk.  I think this one is my fave.  My review is based on an accumulation of about 3 visits.\n\nI usually try to tackle two dogs, even though sometimes that turns out to be a mistake for my tummy.  I love the Vegas Strip dog (\""2 dogs in one bun, mustard, onions, chili, am cheese, guacamole & jalape\u00f1os\"") and anything with bacon.  Their bacon is really good and crisp, definitely not some broken bits from a can.  I mean, this has ruined me for other hot dogs!\n\nIf I have a complaint, it's that the dogs are too loaded and too messy.  I feel like a hot dog needs to be eaten with your hands, but some of these are knife-and-forkers.  The bun just doesn't support the toppings, and there's lots of clean-up afterwards.  This certainly isn't the worst thing that could happen, and in the long-run I'd rather this than skimpy toppings."
1;"Please, please let me begin this review by saying I am not responsible for this reaction and it was entirely motivated by the awful experience my boyfriend and I endured. That being said I shall begin:\nLa Vigne must have some seriously lofty goals because the ideas were both grande as well as maybe too lofty to obtain. We arrived at around 7:30 p.m. to a nearly bare restaurant on a Friday night. Now, particularly one of the reasons I enjoy dining out is for the atmosphere. I enjoy places that are packed with people, entertainment, servers and jubilation that is certain to change my mood. La Vigne was anything but those hot buttons. There were few dining parties, fewer servers and an empty piano bench sitting next to a baby grand piano. We were  however, greeted by the hostess and shown to our table. She offered a strong wine list as well as two heavily bound menus. The menu was a bit complicated. \nSome of the entrees included Seafood, Duck and Poultry, (the standard fair of a french restaurant. Here is where La Vigne earned the two stars, one for the waiter and one for the delectable dinner bread served with an herbed butter as well as tabled olives.\n\nAt this point I implore caution, please only read further if you are interested in my opinion. If not, drop a few twenty dollar bills into a whole in the ground and bury them because that would be much better than suffering through this food.\n\nAfter a few moments we chose some entrees and began the terrible downturn of our experience. I selected an entree that in French was Fruits de Mer....(Seafood), this included scallops, shrimp, mussels, egg noodle pasta and a bit of sprinkled parsley. My boyfriend chose a chicken and pasta entree. The price for each of these entrees ranged from $18.95 to $26.95 for the seafood. From here we settled in and enjoyed some quiet chatting. There was an appetizing course of French Onion soup for myself as well as a Caesar salad for my companion prior to the main course. Soon the entrees had arrived and we were shocked to see what actually came to the table. Our plates were huge and full of food, some what appearing to over compensate for something by showering us with extremely large portions. \nTaste: I separate this one out, because of my own fondness of food I have a very specific palette that can taste everything in a good meal. In this case I was showered with a terrible entree. The shrimp was over cooked, tough and very chewy, the scallops where well done on the exterior and nearly raw on the interior, whereas the mussels didn't even have a supporting role. What was even more astonishing was the flavor the entire plate of egg noodles. Yes, I said Egg Noodles....just like the ones Mom used to prepare in her Hamburger Helpers. I half expected the pasta to be homemade with the prices they were charging. Secondly, the \""pasta\"" was topped with shredded Parmesan cheese. But not the freshly grated fare, no, it was the store bought in a plastic tupperwear, pre-shredded months ago and sitting on the store shelf Parmesan cheese. As I attempted to eat my meal I was reminded that the chef maybe hasn't tried this dish himself because he would be appalled with how bad it tasted. The final nail in this coffin was the olive oil that was drenched over the pasta and seafood. The olive oil was very bitter and had not been infused with anything to save the day. \n\nTo bring an end to recounting this torture I understand that from time to time restaurants experience growing pains. I also understand these restaurants may change in the future, that being said I will re-review this establishment in 6 months time whereas at that time, I trust they will have figured themselves out."
0;Right to the point.  The food service was slow, although the severs were nice.  I ordered an omelet with spinach, mushrooms, jalape\u00f1os, and potatoes.  The small portion of potatoes was under cooked and the omelet was over cooked.  I sent that plate back to the kitchen and just asked for 2 over easy eggs and toast.  The eggs came back fried on the bottom and was tasteless.  After that I simply asked for my check so I could get out of there.  I think this place may only be good for sweet breakfasts (e.g. French toast, pancakes, etc.).  I would not recommend this place at all.
3;"Gute Brauerei, wo man auch gutes und preisg\u00fcnstiges Essen speisen kann. Als weiteres Plus sind der schnelle Service, die M\u00f6glichkeit der Mitnahme von Bier als auch die gute Parkplatzlage zu nennen. Ohne Probleme, jederzeit gerne ;-)"
0;This restaurant was a major dissapointment. \n\nPros:  The food is good not great.  The wine tower is pretty cool.  \n\nCons:  The service/waitstaff is atrocious.  They don't refill drinks.  The are very undeducated about the dishes they are serving.  They are socially awkward.   I could go on and on.  There are a ton of better dining options on the strip.\n\nLook elswhere, trust me on this one.
0;"OMG, I read the other reviews & I have to be honest, I HATED IT!   It was SO AWFUL !!!!  The food was bad & the service was lame! & YES, I'm local & have lived here a long time! We eat out ALOT around Vegas but our experience @ Anime Ramen was a waste of money & time.  I went there with my son's and their girlfriends & we were all disappointed!  We went because my son's have friends in the Anime Club @ UNLV and they recommended it as being way better then Monta Ramen which is right down the street. (They were SO WRONG and both of my son's and their girlfriends made sure they knew it)  My Ramen didn't  even taste OK, I ordered the Miso and it tasted of heavy  fish sauce and had cilantro in it!!! I took 2 bites & pushed the bowl away. If I wanted to eat a Thai based noodle soup I would've gone to a Thai restaurant!  Even after I complained the waitress acted as if that was how Miso soup was suppose to taste!! I use to live in Japan, & I have never had cilantro in my Miso or even fish sauce!!! My kids didn't even finish their meals, in fact $57.00 later and after only being in the restaurant for 25 mins we left and went to Monta because we were still hungry & wanted a decent bowl of ramen!  We won't be going back to Anime Ramen ever and we don''t recommend it to anyone. & by the way, for 5 people I spent less then $40 including the tip for a much better meal at MONTA!! As far as atmosphere, Anime Ramen is more of a \""hang out\"" for kids then a quality Ramen Noodle House. Quality Japanese Noodle Houses don't serve french fries, burgers, or Chicken Pizza! I'm sticking with Monta, yes the lines are always long no matter what time of day or night you go, & the restaurant is small but it is SO MUCH BETTER & worth the money and wait!"
3;"I'm giving this place 4 stars because the atmosphere was great and my friend liked his food. I ordered the \""famous\"" fish and chips and I really wasn't impressed. One piece was good while the other piece was tough and rubbery.  I'd come back and try something else or have a drink. The staff was fantastic and friendly so that always helps."
3;Pleasantly surprised by the great food and excellent prices.  Smallish and intimate restaurant...has about 8 tables.  We came here and tried four dishes.  All of them were full of flavor, generous portions and perfectly cooked.  Service was attentive and friendly.
3;Good chinese-korean food! I loved the noodles and spicy chicken. Worth a try for different type of food.
2;Used the 2 4 1 coupon early evening. This means a 14 dollar cocktail costs 7. Not bad. The coupon doesn't work for the 20 dollar premium cocktails. Service was slow for us.
3;Love the food - not a fan of the atmosphere though.  The blueberry pancakes with the orange butter are fabulous and have completely changed the way I make pancakes at home.  I also love the breakfast sandwich - so good!  The one thing I don't like about the place is how loud it is - the acoustics of the place just seem to amplify everything and it gets too loud for me to really enjoy if it's super busy.
4;"What a great place they have here! \nWent in to try them out after hearing my roommate talking about this place.\n\nIt's very hole in the wall which usually equals good food and boy do they have good food here.\n\n My friend had the cajun elk burrito which I had a bite of and ut was delicious with great spices and good overall flavor. I had the \""Shaggy\"" which had buffalo meat. It wasn't bad, it was mostly the buffalo meat which left it a bit underwhelming as it's generally a hard meat to give flavor to so I cannot blame the chef. \n\nOverall it's not expensive and you get great food overall for you money. Plus the portions are great for hangovers ;).\n\nHospitality is definately a key point here and it shows with their attention and focus on customer service. The owner and the chef were so nice and great hosts it's one of the reasons I will be back. \n\nIf you haven't tried it before you should give them a try. Now to try their muffins."
4;Now, this is a Walgreens (and I've been too quite a few in my life)!  \n\nSure it's in the ghetto, but they have excellent sales (I got a pack of Newcastle for an unheard of $6.99).  Then, in addition to giving me superb service, the young guy at the cashier gave me a $5 coupon on top of my overall purchase.  \n\nIt's true- first impression are important.... and this Walgreen's is doin' it right!  I'm putting a big stamp of approval on it!
1;"Food is good, coffee is good, location is relatively easy to get to and park at...so why the 2 stars?\n\nThe service sucks a lot.  Started going to Coca a few years ago and the service staff used to be super nice.  I always expect a long wait, but they always made you feel welcome, so I didn't mind.  However, the past 3-4 times I've been there, the service has gone WAY downhill.  From the greeting to the service at the tables...wow.\n\n2nd to last time I went I was told \""1 hour\"" for 3 people.  Stood around outside for a bit...got cold and went inside to buy a to-go coffee (which I've always been able to do before).  Was told by one of the servers that it was \""discouraged\"" to get coffee before we sat down, so we can go get coffee down the street...in a condescending \""why are you bothering me\"" tone.\n\nUm...you discourage people to buy coffee from you?\n\nLast time I went, another 1 hr wait for 2 people.  Came back 30mins later, and wanted to see how far we were on the list.  The server snatched up the list, and said \""An hour from whenever I first told you\"" and walked away.\n\nNice.\n\nSo we went to Square Cafe instead in Regent Square...just as busy, just as many people...but far nicer and actually apologized for the 20min wait time."
3;Loved it . We found a new burger place. The fresh made lemonade....awesome French fries was crisy on the outside soft on the inside
1;I'll keep it super short, simple and sweet.\nhis place is huge. Good for large parties. The food is meh, quality control definately isn't happening. Crawfish are small, dirty and overcooked bone dry! So disappointing since they probably get fresh crawfish everyday! \n\nSauce is all over the place, spicy, not spicy all taste the same?! Not as good as in Cali. \nService is careless. Servers are everywhere but they're not paying attention to guests. \n\nNever again will I go to Boiling Crab in LV. Off to Hot N Juicy now...
2;Ridiculously large portions
3;"This is pretty much my \""oh-shit-I'm-outta-gas-n-about-to-get-on-the-101 last chance stop\"".\n\nAlways sparkling clean AND has a pungent smell of bleach as I open the glass doors - morning or night. I love that. It says to me that employees are constantly wiping, mopping, and sanitizing and that rocks in my book. Gas stations have a lot of traffic of people - both dirty and clean, which requires maintenance of floors, counters, etc. So, great job!!\n\nCashiers are always friendly w/me - which I also adore. Something that DOES get under my skin? The male cashier who works early mornings. Why? Because I'm not a morning person - never have been. I will speak as necessary but do not wish to have a full conversation at 6:30am on a Tues en route to work. And, please Sir, don't pester me on \""Why did I select this flavor coffee?\"" and ask me 20million questions about why the sky is blue, and ask me to smile. It really is irritating to me. Really. Nothing personal, I just don't do early mornings is all. :)\n\nHe also works Saturday mornings. Sir: please don't swoop in and give your unsolicited opinion about which crappy gas station sunglasses I should buy according to my hair color and skin tone. Ok? I just need a shitty $10 pair to block the rays, these aren't Ray-Bans. Leave me in peace.\n\nOverall, great place to grab coffee and gas up!"
0;I had often heard that breakfast is quite good at Ihop. \n\nTherefore, we took the opportunity in Las Vegas and visited this restaurant. Unfortunately, our expectations were not fulfilled. I found the restaurant was quite dingy and dirty. The food was OK, but just that. Compared to what was offered, the price was too high in the end. \nMy opinion is, that you can eat breakfast better and cheaper elsewhere.
3;"Line is long during after bar hours.  They got a flat screen with music videos playing while you are waiting in line.  They have a \""VIP\"" where you pay twice the price for the sandwich and you get to skip the line.  Seriously.  The catfish sandwich is perfectly fried with some lettuce, hot sauce and mayo.  Great to soak the alcohol up with."
3;Fried egg on any burger is phenomenal.  The nice thing is that you can go with their creations or create your own masterpiece.  Las Vegas definitely needed another burger joint and this is it.
2;I have seen a number of shows and a number of Cirque shows since I have lived in Vegas. This show was good, but it wasn't what I would consider Cirque Good. It is a very entertaining show, nice crowd interaction comedy interspersed with some music singing and other talent performances.\n\nI am fortunate enough to have a friend in another Cirque show who got us some comp tickets for last night's show. I don't know if I would have liked the show as much had I paid full price for the tickets. \n\nAs mentioned, it was an entertaining and good show. It just wasn't *Cirque du Soleil Good* in my eyes.
1;"We were there the first weekend that they transitioned to \""Westin Lake Las Vegas\""\nThe Westin Lake Las Vegas is for one group of people. You are in this group if you have the following:\n-kids\n-love of water\n-love of the outside\n-doesn't do anything in the room but sleep\nAs long as you meet all of those requirements, then this resort is for you. If it rains, like it did on the second day of our trip, then you are screwed. There is nothing to do besides the pools and lake and the activities on the lake. Luckily, the Las Vegas strip is 30 minutes away, so we ditched the good ole soggy lake and hit the casino. \nNow I am not the type to stay away from the room. I want my room to have a garden bath tub, a view and lots of space. The Westin is none of these. Our room was small, dark, dirty and old. And we paid extra to have this room. Yeah.....like I said we ditched it after 1 night.....not just because of the rain. There were so many mosquitoes in the room that I had to stand on the bed with a wad of toilet paper and kill them. I didn't succeed in getting all of them which resulted in many bites in the morning. The rooms should come with a mosquito net. Also, I'm only 5'6....I shouldn't be able to stand on a full bed and reach the ceiling...but I guess I didn't mention the drop ceiling in our tiny room. The lake and the activities are nice, I would have liked to take the kids down to the lake for the fire and s'mores, but it's not worth the dirty room. I would rather stay in a tent."
3;Great pizza, but not worth the trouble of the wait.  You can get wine next door, while you wait, but the attraction of the place is due to great publicity.  Try once and decide if the hassle is worth it.  I won't go back.
4;Got the red curry and was pleasantly surprised at how great and fast it was. I have had hotter Thai food but not much better than this.
3;Expect long lines!! But it's definitely worth the wait and considering how cheap the prices are. You can't go wrong with Earl of Sandwich!!\n\nI ordered the OG sandwich! Yeeee\nfreshly roasted beef, cheddar cheese & creamy horseradish sauce. It was a perfect combination. The horseradish went well with errythangg. \n\nMy bf ordered the montagu sandwich which consisted of the whole shebang--freshly roasted beef, turkey, swiss cheese & cheddar cheese, lettuce, roma tomatoes & the Earl's mustard sauce. I think this was a little too heavy and too much for my appetite.\n\nI was eye-ing on the turkey holiday sandwich but it seemed way too heavy for me. Next time fo'sho! \n\nWe also ordered their loaded potato soup which was very yummy! =)\n\nI give this place 4.5/5. Dock of 1/2 a point for the wait =P But it's quick once you get to the front of the line and order your food. \n\nP.s. soda tasted sooo good with my meal. or maybe 'cause I was a tad bit hungover and was hella thirsty.\n\nGo check out this place when you're in vega$ =)
4;amazing service, went there for my prom was not disappointed, amazing steak some of the finest in las vegas for its price
0;The employees are the rudest and most miserable people on the planet. Went through the drive thru and had to repeat my order several times and it was still wrong when I got it. I told the drive thru girl and she told me that next time I needed to place my entire order at the speaker box next time because they dont have time to correct or add things at the window. I then proceeded to tell her that I tried to order it but they got it wrong. She rolled her eyes, slammed the window, talked to some guy, opened the window, literally tossed my missing items at me and then refused to get the manager for me when I asked. Instead, she just slammed the window in my face again. Spend your money anywhere but here.
3;I would have given them 5 stars if they had the ox tail or the catfish.... But for summer season it is not apart of their menu. \n\nBut if your in the mood for meat so tender it falls off the bone this is the place for you! \n\nI had the goat curry.... Amazing towards the end of my meal I noticed I started eating slower b/c I knew soon it would be all gone.  I will be sure to come back!! \n\nI will give it the nom, nom, nom rating of deliciousness.
3;Talk about awesome sandwich! Can't get enough of their paninis and all of it are at a reasonable price! Service is great too! This is probably the only place that I would recommend to my friends about getting a delicious sandwich.
4;Stopped in for the first time Friday night. Good music, great sound system, plenty of nice quality screens stiff drinks and cold beers with brand specific glasses. Food was ample and of very good quality. \n\nI understand they have a rotation of 5 live bands. This is my new favorite place.
0;I thought the food was coming directly from Thailand, because of how long it took to get it.\n\nFrom the moment we entered things seemed a bit off. We were not welcomed, and after a awkward two minutes up front the hostess walked to the tables with some menus and we assumed to follow her.\n\nWe got to our table and review the lunch menu, pretty much standard items. We waited some time before we put in our orders, we also hand to remind the waitress that we needed to order drinks.\n\nAfter a decent wait our soup came,   and then our waters.  The soup was decent and it was fun to spicy with the condiment tray on the table.\n\nWe then waited, waited and waited,  47 minutes after we entered our food arrived, this does not work well for a lunch.\n\nMy Druken Noodles were mushy and soft. (6.95 combo)  The Won-ton chips were quite stale and my meal did not even come with the egg roll that the menu indicated was included.\n\nJust a note if you decide to come here for some reason their spice scale is the same 1-5 but 3 is hotter than you usual 3.\n\nWe then played the waiting game again to get some dogie bags and our bill which we just paid upfront.\n\nThere are faster, and better options around that are worth the extra $1.
4;Is it possible to have the perfect lunch?\n\nYes! And I found it here at Cafe Zupas!  \n\nThere are enough soup, salad, and sandwich choices to please every palate.  It is the perfect light lunch that is very reasonably priced.  You can get a combo for under $10!\n\nHealthy? Questionable but that depends on what you get. The soups are mostly cream based and the dressings are rich. I got my dressing on the side but found my salad to be so flavorful as is that I hardly needed dressing.\n\nAnd the strawberry on top is that you get a free chocolate dipped strawberry with your meal!  Awesome!\n\nService is amazing too! Everyone is so friendly and helpful. I couldn't have felt more welcomed.
0;The worst airline I've ever taken! We had a carry-on roller with us outbound to Vegas with no charge as almost all DECENT airlines are. To our horror however, flying back to LAX we were to be charged A HUNDRED DOLLARS for the same carry on bags we had flying in! They were gonna charge us $100 for each bag at the gate telling us they were not going to hold the plane if we decided to check in the bags which were gonna require us to go downstairs to the check in counter then the security again and back. They said they didn't offer valet either.  Oh, the charge for checking in each bag was gonna be $45 by the way. Isn't this called highway robbery!? This should be completely illegal! \n\nI ran into the nearby souvenir shop and got us a huge shopping bag to transfer all our stuff from the original bags and saved us $200, 3 minutes to spare before dept time. I HATE SPIRIT AIR, I swear!!
3;This place is a perfect place to go when everyone is ready for a carb-loading type of dinner the night before an intense workout or marathon! Lol \n\nThe food here are freshly made.  Pomodoro Fresco with capers and shrimp is such a good combo !!!!  When you order something with shrimp, it's actually fresh raw shrimp that they grill up  not frozen and heated up.  \n\nAfter your meal there's a Golden Spoon you can hit up for dessert :P
1;"The Tom Yum Goong here was good.  It had a great balance of hot and sour, along with generous portions of mushroom, tomato and shrimp.  At spice level 3 out of 5 my lips felt some fire, but my tongue didn't taste much heat.  With this being the first dish brought out, I felt that it was a strong start to the meal.  The other highlight of the night were the Chop Chop Original Thai-Style Chicken Wings.  The sauce was good; the chicken, not so much.\n\nMy palate and experience for Thai food is admitedly limited, since I always like to order Panang Curry and Pad See Ew whenever I'm at a Thai restaurant.  Due to that habit I've come to form my own expectations for these two dishes, and those expectations were not met at Mr. Chop Chop.  The Panang Curry had a sweet flavor, and the Pad See Ew tasted like noodles that were just heated up; not much flavor was present.\n\nOne thing that was different about this meal was that each dish came out on it's own, as if each dish was it's own course.  We were at the restaurant for two hours, and much of that time was spent eating.  Out of the five dishes we ordered, four of them were ordered at the same time at the beginning.  I don't know if they usually serve their food one dish at a time, but I was definitely expecting most of the food to come out together.  Two stars says it all: I've experienced better."
1;If there's any way you can make it over to Total Wine in Arrowhead, then without a doubt: pass this place up!  \n\nThough we haven't always found what we came looking for, they admittedly do have a decent selection. \n\nThe handful of times that we've been in, it has been due to convenience.  However, the poor customer service always leaves me grimacing as we walk out the door.  Even when we came with a friend who was buying several bottles of Dom Perignon for his own wedding, spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars there, the service he received was horrendous.  We were all appalled.\n\nThere are definitely better places to find what you are looking for!
3;"Very capable of 5 stars, and once things are operating a little more smoothly, this will be one of my favorites! Great food & amibience. The Devil's Eggs were incredibly good, as was the wild mushroom flatbread. My Mac & Cheese serving was really tiny, but I couldn't eat more than a few bites after appetizers, even though it was excellent. The one dish we all agreed needs to go was the black rice risotto. They really should paint the roof beams charcoal or silver; they really look like what they are rather than a nice open beam feel."
0;I wanted to love this place, and I really don't want to give a mean review but here's what I found. \n\nTables and floors....filthy on a Sunday afternoon. Ick right off the bat.\nOnion rings.....SUPER greasy. I have a tummy ache as I'm writing. \nDogs.....well, I've had better standing on a rainy street corner in NYC.\nPrice.....way high and not a great value for what you get.\n\n A clean restaurant and a smiling face or two would have really gone a long way in softening my review. \n\n(Lebowski's has nothing to worry about with their new neighbor.)
3;Not sure why this place is getting such low reviews. This place is very good, not the best but very good. The service is always good, and the quality and cut of the fish is great. I go there very often for lunch with coworkers, dinner with my girlfriend and have even gone in large groups. \n\nThe Sushi Chef is always telling jokes and interacting with us and the owner or manager makes sure we are taken care of.\n\nThe only problem is the cost, it can be a little over priced, but still better than other places around.
0;The one star reviews are extremely accurate. Not coming back, too bad -- cool location.
3;"My husband and I consider ourselves BBQ connoisseurs after sampling the best of what Texas has to offer last year, so we were very excited to visit Union Pig and Chicken.  \n\nI've read that other reviewers were disappointed in the prices and the portion sizes.  I could not have had a more opposite reaction.  Our friendly waitress suggested the two of us get the choose 2 with a side and cornbread and assured us that it would be enough.  At $20 I have to say this is a steal and DEFINITELY the way to go if you are a party of 2.  We picked the pork shoulder and brisket with a side of greens.  We also ordered an appetizer of pork belly lettuce wraps.  \n\nFirst off, the pork belly lettuce wraps were awesome.  I'll be disappointed if they are not on the menu when we go back.  Our meat came and our waitress explained that the sauces on the table were a spicy habanero sauce, a more traditional BBQ sauce, and a vinegary sauce (she described them MUCH better and gave specific ingredients in each.)  Right off the bat my husband was disappointed that you do not get bread to go with your meat.  That was pretty standard in every BBQ place we've been.  Our brisket was juicy and tender but the fat was very overwhelming.  I understand keeping fat on for flavor and absolutely do not mind a bit of it, but this was A LOT of fat.  The pork shoulder was amazing and my favorite part of the meal.  \n\nThe sauces were good, but none were \""i can't get enough... can I drink this?\"" good.  My favorite was the spicy habanero which was the perfect level of spice for me but WAY too spicy for my husband (wimp).  It had an awesome burn to it that crept up on me and warmed my whole body up.  A true gem for a heat lover.  \n\nThe greens were good, but not memorable.  I thought the cornbread was very good but was too sweet for my husband.  \n\nI can't wait to go back to try the fried chicken.  The couple next to us got it and it looked delicious.  Also I'd love to try their mac n cheese... well... because I'd like to eat all of the mac n cheese on the planet.  \n\nYou can definitely find best BBQ in Pittsburgh at Union Pig and Chicken.  We had a high quality meal for a very reasonable price, but it just fell short in a few areas where we had high expectations."
4;Food is always good, come here every Monday, great staff too! Megan and Lowen are always awesome servers and we only visit when they are working!
3;A nice fast food place that overthrows Wienerschnitzel's effortlessly. \n\nI ordered the double cheeseburger with chili fries and I'm currently experiencing food coma. The patties were much leaner than something you would get at mcdonalds and rivals In-n-Out. Good price for the food. I like!
4;"Back when this place was Katz's Deli, I looked at the grungy, pallid walls, the worn vinyl booths, and the dreadful florescent lighting and thought to myself: \""Wow, this place would look better gutted\"". \n\nAnd yes, yes it does.\n\nNice brunch menu that's priced surprisingly well, comfortable atmosphere (and really nice booths), good coffee and service with a smile. \n\nNew favorite."
1;"My boyfriend and I had been wanting to try this place for awhile, so when we saw a meet up group was scheduled to try this place out, we decided to sign up. I haven't found my perfect burger joint in Las Vegas yet, and I was hoping this would be it. \n\nNot so much. \n\nThe restaurant itself has a good atmosphere.  Chalk boards on the wall that you can leave messages on give it a nice cozy touch.  There is a bar area that you can get alcohol at if you wish, however, the rest of the restaurant is a very family oriented environment.  A walk up counter where you place your order gives the restaurant an additional casual feel. \n\nUnfortunately, the hamburgers themselves are just not that good.  To begin with, the menu only offers about 6 different burger options.  The woman across the table from me had ordered the \""caprese\"" burger, which was supposed to be a twist on a caprese salad.  Which is actually a cool idea.  A generous slice of mozzarella was atop her burger, but the one tomato slice looked sad and carelessly plopped on there, and the few limp slices of basil looked limp.  My boyfriend ordered the barbecue burger, which caramelized onions in place of straw onions.  In a weird twist, the \""homemade\"" barbecue sauce is actually a cross between ketchup and barbecue, and the restaurant has neither, plain ketchup, or plain barbecue.  A conservative dollop was on top of his burger, along with soggy onions that appeared to have been swimming in grease, and sitting on a fryer for an extended period of time. (Note that the menu does have options besides classic hamburgers such as veggie burgers and a salmon burger- which I didn't try and can't comment on. However, if you are a burger place and can't make a good hamburger, I just don't trust you to make experimental substitutes). \n\nI will say that the \""I love bacon\"" burger I ordered- a combination of ground bacon, and brisket, topped with bacon and \""bacon mayo\"" was pretty good, and the most impressive of the burgers I saw.  It was maybe a bit dry, but then again, that is what happens when you make a hamburger out of brisket.  Finally, our order of sweet potato fries were somewhat bland, a little overdone, and nothing to really get excited over.  The Parmesan garlic fries that our dining companions ordered were alright to munch on while we waited for our food, but again, nothing I would miss if I never had again. \n\nOverall, it was an OK experience, but given the many restaurants in the area, I doubt I will be back."
1;"BLT Burger just opened today. It's a high-end burger restaurant with a big-name chef behind it like The Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay. \n\nThe kitchen is open with a squad of sous-chefs furiously flipping meat like they were cirque du soleil jugglers; the decor is as thoughtful and deep as a Hallmark card; the staff are energetic and earnest as if  they were about to auditon for \""American Idol\"".\n\nThe meat is ground by a butcher in the back; a combination of Black Angus sirloin, short ribs and chuck. The buns are made to order by La Brea bakery. \n\nThe regular burger is very good ($9), but under-seasoned (you might want to add some salt). The various cheeses are $1 each. I had the sweet potato fries which were excellent with just the right degree of crispness. There is a good selection of draft beers; and a few choices of wines by the glass (there should be more than 3 in a restaurant with this pedegree). Not to mention that they serve it in Italian-bistro glasses instead of proper wine glasses.\n\nWhen I asked for dijon mustard, the very eager and agreeable barman brought me some packets of Grey Poupon (they had better fix that!).\n\nThey also have an American Kobe burger ($17), a lamb burger, a chicken burger and a few other concoctions that didn't capture my attention.\n\nI was disappointed to see that there was a line behind a velvet rope, waiting to get in, even though there were many empty tables. One of the managers told me it was because it was opening night and they were just getting their bearings. \nI hope that's the case, and that they haven't fallen prey to the \""manufactured exclusivity\"" hustle that other places indulge in, including The Burger Bar. I've got some advice for all those places that think diners will enjoy their food more if they are forced to wait for it:  You're a restaurant, dammit, not an after-hours club!\n\nIn any case, BLT is a good addition to the vast Vegas burger scene. It's not the best burger I've had here, but it's better than The Burger Bar, and way better than Burger Brasserie or Stipburger. \n\nSo unless you're willing to go off-strip to an unadorned little joint like The Burger Stop where the outstanding Kobe Burger is half the price, BLT will do just fine."
0;Lucky to even be receiving 1 star. I had an appointment for 2pm today. The professional assigned called me at maybe 1130 same day saying should couldn't come but she would find someone else who could (her name is LaToya). After about 45 min I never hard from her so I called the company because it was pretty shady. They said they had no idea she couldn't make it and that the professionals as they like to call them are supposed to call in if they cannot make it. Handy told me they would get someone else to come. About 20 minutes later they told me that the earliest someone could get out here would be on Saturday. Worst Experience ever. I just got a refund and called it a day. Not very professional at all.
1;When you walk in, it's immediately dark.  It doesn't feel like a burger joint, it feels like a burger restaurant.  Nice booths and friendly but slow service.\n\nI got pretty excited while looking at the menu.  There were so many options.  I opted for the Melting Pot burger with the patty done medium.  When the burger came out, it looked good - nicely stacked.  But the first bite into it it was cold, room temperature at best.  The patty was mostly rare and not how a medium burger should be cooked.  The flavors of the cheeses and bacon was good, but the meat patty itself was seriously lacking - I could hardly taste it at all.  \n\nPretty sorry burger, if you ask me.   I'm hoping my burger was just sitting out cold while they were making the fries, which I ordered chili cheese style.  They tasted good and were hot and piping.  Yum!\n\nBurger was wack.  My friend and I said we could have gotten better burgers at Five Guys (go there instead!).  \n\nThere's no excuse for a cold burger.
2;It's a place to shop. Nothing particularly interesting or unique when it comes to stores or atmosphere or set-up. But they do cover most of the basics (Ann Taylor, White House Black Market, Bebe, etc.) in a smaller shopping area than say Caesars or the Fashion Show - so that's nice. It's also not near as crowded as those shopping areas - which is also nice. And it always cracks me up how about half of the area is still all old Aladdin. You go from wannabe modern and chic to old Middle East.
4;This place is amazing. The food is delicious and the restaurant is very clean with wonderful service. Everything I had was delicious, you really cannot go wrong with this place!
4;I have been going to Jennifer for a couple years now for my waxing, facials and skin care and she is amazing. She is always knowledgable, I always feel comfortable in her spa. I really recommend the Dermaplaning after your facial it is way better then Microdermabrasion. My skin looked amazing after she worked on me and will go back this winter to follow up with some peels.
2;Met a friend at 1900 for dinner tonight. The pico was delish but otherwise my tostada was nothing out of the ordinary. The prices seemed a bit high for your average Mexican restaurant but I would probably give it another try!
2;Food is good and service is good. But I freeze every time I'm here. I ask for a seat on a warmer area, but it is cold everywhere. You really need to bring a jacket or sweater even in July.
2;Small gift shop featuring trinkets and candles, picture frames and optimistic phrases printed on various surfaces. \nFrankly, this seemed like a place old ladies might shop. In addition to the unorganized, oddball gift selections they also offer custom order invitations. Didn't see a particular brand they carried and they didn't appear to do them in-house by hand, but had several samples out to view.\n\nPrices are all over the place with various baskets of junk marked with clearance prices and high regular prices on items I can't imagine buying. Very bizarre selection.
0;We waited forever for our food when we were the only ones in the place eating. We could barely understand our what our waitress was saying. My friends burger had a footlong hair in it. We will NEVER eat here again. TERRIBLE.
3;Going to a home improvement store isn't exactly something I love to do.  It usually involves work once you leave.  That being said, this Home Depot does make it about as painless as possible to get in and out as any I've been to.  \n\nThe location is so obscure that I don't think many people come here so that makes it very easy to get in, get what you need and get out without a lot of hassle.

1;"I came here last night with girl friends (girls night out)  to see the awful burlesque act the Bridge City Bombshells.\n\nThey gave me the \""you are beautiful\"" stamp. lol. How nice of them. \n\nOther than that, I've been to better places. It is a dark dingy dive. Eclectic clientelle though, from gay and straight to goth and yinzer and even some people who gave us girls the heebie jeebies. \n\nMaybe I should go on a different night? The entertainment was lousy. I had a better time at the Rex at The Pretty Things Peepshow."
0;Was looking for new stylist so went on Yelp and found Mood Swing.  So made an appointment and had a haircut to fix last cut she did ok job not what I was expecting according to reviews.  So deceived to try again to change my color and did not come out at all like was hoping and haircut was not even at all will not go back again.
0;Well, here it is -- July 27th and they still are slow rolling me on my insurance claim.  What a crappy company.
1;STORY\n\nI've been to this place three times. First time, to get a 90k service and two tires. The prices were awesome, the service price were good because of their anniversary promotion and the tires were priced well due to it being last day of the month or something like that. Anyway, I came away happy. \n\nI came back a few weeks later with a noise/vibration that I couldn't quite figure out and was told that it was my suspension that needed replacement. Okay, fine, I thought so anyway. a couple of weeks later vibration got even worse and when I came back yet again, I was told that all my motor/transmission mounts collapsed since they were old and needed to be replaced, hence the vibration. Quite an interesting suggestion considering that one of the mounts was less than 4 months old, so while it MIGHT have collapsed, it certainly would not be old. Taking the truck back to where I had it serviced for the motor mount, the real culprit was found: rear differential falling apart and rear drive shaft disconnecting. Sooo... nothing to do with motor mounts.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nI would come here for the good deal for tires in a heartbeat, but will have to skip on any services and especially any fixes that these guys offer.
3;Perhaps a bit on the pricey side, but sometimes you pay for atmosphere. This very sexy and trendy joint is located at City North (next to Blue Martini). I ordered the #1 sirloin burger with carmelized onions, gorgonzola, crescenza (soft, buttery cheese), arugula & thousand island dressing. OMG! It was massive and juicy and made me lose all dining diplomacy as the juices dripped down my arm! My friend built his own w/ hickory bbq sauce, cheddar and bacon. \n\nOn the side we had onion rings, sweet potatoe fries mixed w/ reg fries. Errrr....lemme make sure my gym membership is still active!! LOL\n\nPersonally, and I know this will cause a small uproar, I think the burgers are FAR better than Delux! I never understood the Delux cult following anyway. There...I said it! :)\n\nI even endulged in the Guinnes milkshake (Guinness beer/vanilla bean & chocolate ice cream)! You know the saying don't knock it til you try it??This would be one of those times. When's the last time you had a sugar high and a buzz at the same time off a desert....hmmm?? \n\nBon Appetite!
3;Fantastic food, service and ambiance. The owner recommended our dishes and wine. The red sauce was amazeballs!
3;Had the friendliest server and the quickest service of anywhere I've dined on the strip. Got a wrap and fries, both very yummy. Drinks are served in mason jars, which I found adorable.  Live country band playing during dinner/late night which made it hard to chat, but you obviously know you're getting into that when you enter. With as pricey as most places here are for subpar food, Toby Keith's far surpassed my expectations.
4;Finally got to try this place! It's definitely the real deal. I went with the to-go option just because it was a long day and I wanted to head home, but they probably have around 30 seats in the place. The decor definitely takes most of its cues from the Korean side, and the feel is pretty casual overall.\n\nCompletely loved the pork fusion taco. Bold flavors all-around (make sure to squeeze lime), with the only drawback being that I didn't order two or more. The chicken fusion taco was pretty good but wasn't as flavorful for me. I want to give a re-do on the bulgogi fusion burrito because I ended up saving it for a late dinner and it might've lost its touch by then.\n\nI'd love to go back soon, bring a friend, and try some fusion nachos or fries. Maybe a fusion chimichanga too, or the flautas that come with fusion guac (what's that?!)
3;re: vacation\n\nSo there is a short line to get in.  I'm not too surprised, but if you ever been to any other pawn shop, this one is extremely nice (of course, right?  they have to, because of tv.)  Their prices are a little more than you'll find at most other pawn shops, but that's to be expected given the amount of traffic that goes through there.  I thought their higher end stuff had some fair prices.  Certainly if I were in the market for a Rolex watch, I would definitely buy it from here.  The reason being is that I'd be very confident that this place isn't going to screw you over so that it can maintain it's reputation.  \n\nBiggest surprise for me was how small the area where the 'Old Man' and Rick sit.  Camera definitely makes that area look bigger than what I saw.
0;Went in to order something they show on their online menu only to have them tell me that they no longer make that item. Hmmmmm. Not impressed on previous visits either. Won't be back.
4;One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas.  Its definitely overpriced but you're in the Bellagio for chrissakes.  You're not getting any bargains here.  The filet is surprisingly good and how can you ever, ever, ever say no to warm doughnuts?  The lobster tacos are another fav of mine.
4;I almost can't articulate how wonderful my brunch was at Meat and Potatoes this past weekend, but I will try.\n\nI went with a friend who I was visiting in Pittsburgh and we both got the Irish Breakfast Coffee, which was Jameson, Maple Whipped Cream, and Orange Peel. It was really delicious, not too boozy, just enough to tingle a little bit with the citrus when you took a sip.\n\nWe also shared the grilled bread with goat butter and rhubarb, and honestly I would have been sold at just bringing me the jar of rhubarb. It was so, so so good. And the perfect portion to not fill you up before your main dish.\n\nFor my main, I had the PBLT. I love BLT's as they are, and I've had other iterations of them with avocado and what not, but I don't think I was prepared for this. Pork belly, bacon, arugula, tomato and truffled mayo... AND it came with delicious fries?\n\nEverything was fantastic all around, if you don't give this place a shot you're doing yourself a disservice.
4;This place is a gem. there is a reason it is frequently busy. the prices are fantastic (they did FINALLY raise them a bit, and it's still cheap as hell!). the food is basic, and fresh, and tasty. ask for a side of pickles, for like .75 cents, and they will bring you a bunch of them....and they're so good! the service occasionally comes with a little attitude...but only a little. noisy, crowded, and not fancy. but the food ROCKS. i suggest the falafal sandwich for around $3. THANK YOU HAJI BABA!! oh, and not to mention they have an absolutely kick-ass middle eastern market in the restaurant! Buy your pita bread here for $1, and it's much better than the grocery store one for $3. Enjoy!
2;Artsy fartsy. We stayed here for our cousin's wedding. I like places like this! Art all over the place. Sometimes, it even felt haunted at times and that the eyes in some of the paintings were following me. \n\nI loved the ambience of this place. No gambling here, so it felt like we weren't even in Vegas, but a small boutique hotel in LA or SF rather.\n\nOur room was A-ok. First room we checked into was dirty. Used washcloth on our bed and toilet paper on the floor. Disgusted, I requested for a new room immediately. I was hoping to get upgraded to a bigger room for the inconvenience but that didn't happen. We changed to a similar room, but it was cleaner nonetheless. Dust on the remote control and clogged up bathtub were my only complaints. \n\nOur cousins, however stayed in one of the penthouse suites. Pretty sweet I must say. Same suite the Kardashiens stay at when they're in Vegas. \n\nI will not be staying here again, but it was a cool experience.
1;Good ramen is a worthy obsession.  Great ramen?...nearly orgasmic!  Poor ramen?...scorns the taste buds--mercilessly ridiculing your incompetent decision.\n\nI started this review thinking Hiromaru Fusion Ramen was a 2.5 or 3 star experience...as I wrote and recalled my experience, I ended  up feeling like I couldn't justify anything beyond 2 stars.\n\nI wasn't really a fan all the way around.  There are two distinct dinning areas.  One is bright and clean...lots of white...bright lights... accented with strong, vibrant red and some natural wood.  Did I mention this side is bright?  Well, it is...pretty sure surgeons prefer less light during intricate operations.  The other side is calm and peacefully brought together with muted browns, blues and the like.  The lighting on this side pushes towards a romantic feel and I would certainly try to sit on this side if I return.\n\nWe tried the Shiroi Tonkotsu (Salted White Tonkotsu) $7.95 and the signature-fusion Carbonara Ramen $10.95.  Neither ramen left us wanting more.  A few distinct changes have taken place based on some early comments.  Both noodles were thin, eggs were executed well.  Previous reviewers have complained about the thick noodles.  I didn't have those...I will go ahead and complain about the thin noodles instead.  I like a bit more bite.  There isn't much tooth found in these overly thin noodles. The Shiroi had a nice flavor on the front, but lingered in a way that I didn't enjoy.  ...wasn't even a fan of the thin pork in this ramen, so while I could put a whole bowl of this down, I won't be seeking it out anytime soon.  The Carbonara excited me even less.  I didn't like the flavors or the texture of the broth.  The noodles were the same as described previously, only this time there was nothing redeeming for me in this bowl.\n\nI didn't have the opportunity to try any of the side dishes, but probably won't (unless I hear that they are something special) since I won't be back for the ramen.
2;I just thought this restaurant was average as far as pizza is concerned.  The inside is really nice and modern but the pizza was just okay and a little overpriced. I would check out other options in the area for pizza.
3;Just went for the first time.  The Waterfront is a great location with lots of shopping and restaurants. \n\nI ordered the Filet, Shrimp and Lobster combo. It was very good. It also came with fried rice (not an extra charge), shrimp appetizer (3 to be exact), salad with sesame dressing, vegetables and soup.   The Hibachi show was a lot better than any other restaurant that I have been to throughout the US.  There was a lot of knife twirling and several volcano-like activities.  I didn't order Sushi but other people at my table did. It looked very good.  \n\nService was a little slow since they only had 2 chefs.  Waiter was very attentive. Pricing was comparable to Benihanas.
0;Dirty rooms. Really overpriced Internet in room
0;on friday night there is a DJ set, attracting the hipster crowd-more of a social gathering than anything-always spills over into the parking lot.  somehow you are allowed to bring your drink outside.  usually there is a pretty good vibe, just kids checking eachother out, shooting the shit whatever. \n\nt beware of bringing your own booze and drinking it in the parking lot.  the yuppie owner flipped the hell on me and my girlfriend (i thought he was gonna hit her), plenty of good coked up yelling, and all and all unprofessional behavior..even his bouncer was taken aback.  \nso that's what kind of experience i got after dropping 40 bucks a weekend for a month on overpriced beers, to just hang out in a parking lot on paradise.\n\nwhat bothers me is that this guy also owns firefly next door, and i used to be able to enjoy their late night fare.
2;"This is a nice little location; off the strip so it feels less crowded and more relaxed.\n\nThe girls seemed to be bothered by having to help us, but they weren't rude.\n\nI wouldn't mind coming back here."
1;The food here is a real hit it miss, I'm not much of a fan of soul food seeing how it's usually a big hype of generic tasting foods. I went in not with high hopes and to my amazement I was right the food was horrid. \n\nI decided to try the smothered steak with 2 sides(Mac+cheese bland)... This was one of the worst decisions of my life. The steak was in pieces and swimming in gravy making it look like I ordered soup with a side of beef jerky. The texture of the meat seemed nothing near fresh, it tasted as of it were made a week in advanced and consistently frozen and defrosted everyday for preparation on the days menu. I would never slam anyone's cooking like this but it seriously had the consistency of a schools lunch food prepared by microwave. Not palatable to any extent. The only thing that did bring me some enjoyment was the delectable corn bread pancake. I don't think I could bare to give this place another shot.
3;We wanted to have some tree questions answered, so we paid them a visit. This nursery is huge, so I was shocked when we were continuously approached to see if we needed help. We had all of our questions answered and the employees were extremely helpful. Prices seemed reasonable and everything was nicely organized, which made it really easy to walk around and check out their inventory.
2;They have a weird process of getting ppl in, but the place isn't that bad. Reminds me of just any typical Hollywood club, the sound system bangs pretty hard +1. Interesting acrobatics on the dance floor, pregame beforehand or your wallet will come out a lot lighter....
4;"This is a very nice hotel.  I really liked my room; love the light controls and the fact that the drapes are automated.\n\nEvery employee I encountered was very polite and eager to help.\n\nI'm not a gambler, I'm not big on Vegas, but this is a great place to stay!"
2;Went last night with a party of five. Had a reservation and table was waiting for us.  The food was good especially the chicken wonton soup. However, the service was another story. The food took a very long time to come out and one meal arrived about 5-10 minutes after the others. Plus, we had to ask for water a couple times.  We will return though. Chinese food options are few and our favorite Jo Jo in Stonecrest closed down.
4;"Addicted to their fried pickles! Everything was really good ~ whole family enjoyed their orders, I liked the brisket the most (stole from my husbands plate)! I ordered the redneck tacos, the meat and slaw was delicious, but didn't really like the corn pancake - it would be a hundred times better on regular pancakes :) Nice atmosphere and the coolest bbq sign inside the restaurant, that you'll have to read for yourself ;) oh and they DO TO have Iced Tea! (someone commented that they didn't) haha"
4;Great food from one of the Co-founders of AJ's grocery stores. Great place to go before a movie and great food.
1;I had a pretty good experience when I went here for my pedi.. The price is good for the services you get, and I thoroughly enjoyed having my feet wrapped with lotion in the plastic wrap.\nThe reason I give 2 stars is because the woman who did my nails seemed kind of pissy or at least, not happy. I like to engage in conversations with the nail tech but, she was silent, she'd glance away and look somewhere else, disinterested, on a few occasions.. She answered her phone. Honestly, I don't think a single word was said to me, other than me being asked if I'd like my nails short.\nThe woman doing my mother's nails was a lot friendlier, so I figured I'd give the place another chance. Many times I have called the salon during their business hours asking for them to call me back so I can make an appointment to come in. If I held my breath waiting for that phone call back, I would have been dead months ago. I know it's not just me, my mother told me the same story, every time you call and leave a message, there's no response back.\nIf you want business perhaps you should respond back to your customers, since your voicemail says you will call back. I thought I had found my new regular nail salon, but I find their actions to be extremely rude and will just find a new nail salon now.
1;Well I went back for a second time because the food was great. My girl friend and I love the cheese bread and pizza.  And believe it or not they have some of the best ranch. No I'm not a picky person but I do appreciate good ranch, not that hidden valley stuff. So they have good food and great ranch. \n\nBut that's it.\n\nMy complaint is not with the staff, they are relatively friendly, and young. Both of which aren't bad things. They have no guidance. \n\nManagement is terrible!\n\nThe place is filthy, always understaffed, and filthy. It was Friday night, the floor hadn't been swept, the tables around us were not bussed, and the soda area was disgusting. I would say 10 tables didn't have anybody sitting at them when we walked in, and 8 of them were dirty. I had to wipe my own table because I didn't want to next to the kid section. \n\nManagement here's some advise. Always over schedule, and make cuts. Your restaurant is in a great location. And it is Friday night. If your place was cleaner than your business would thrive. You might get regulars. \n\nIf I was you I would hire four teenage boys to just bus tables and sweep floors. Nothing else. \n\nThat or actually ride your staff and push them harder. I wouldn't allow their armpits on the kitchen window either. \n\nStop leaning.
4;Wow! How can you say......amazing always all the time! We have been coming here for 3 years...... It has been short of Amazing everyone! Come'on!!!
4;Sexy everything..... Make sure to reserve a Lily Pad!!!!!
0;The food was w/e but the staff were unbearable. Never again.
2;"Before I started Yelping here in Madison, we lived for 13 years in the Twin Cities, the adopted hometown of Famous Dave Anderson, where he turned his original, Hayward, Wis., BBQ joint into a multi-state chain. We have been to Famous Dave's dozens of times in close to a dozen locations. Their quality is very consistent -- solid, not spectacular, although their portion sizes have shrunk over the years. We'll be back to Famous Dave's many more times, I'm sure. For now, I'm just going to letter grade all the menu items I remember trying: \n\nBrisket: A-. Some of the best I've had. Nice smoke ring, tender, deep flavor. The minus is for the small portions and occasional grisly days. Use the Texas Pit sauce.\n\nPulled pork: B+. I'm not a huge pulled pork fan but theirs is pretty good. I like it with the Georgia Mustard, Devil's Spit or Wilbur's Revenge sauce. \n\nRibs/rib tips: B+/A-. The ribs are pricey but tender and smoky. Sometimes overcooked. The tips come in a generous portion, naked with a rub, and a tangy sauce. They get a minus only because they're tips, not ribs. Still, I'd get them over the ribs just for the value.\n\nHot links: B. Good smoked sausage, nothing special. They seem overcooked sometimes, as well. I like them with the brisket on the Texas Manhandler sandwich. \n\nChicken: smoked - B; roasted - C. Kinda greasy and made with scrawny chickens, but the BBQ chicken holds the smoke flavor well. Skip the roast chicken. It's got a sweet flavor with a hint of citrus. Lemon, maybe? I don't get it.\n\nNew: Burnt ends. B+. Would be an A if the portion was bigger. These are very tender, hold their smoke flavor and definitely worth trying. Just order an extra side so you don't leave hungry.\n\nWings: Skip them. My son thinks they made him sick. Possible, because they're just not good. Go to a wing joint for wings.\n\nSides: Beans C, potato salad B, coleslaw B+, fries B+, corn muffins B, corn cobs C-, garlic mashed potatoes B-, drunken apples B+ (my kids' fav side)."
3;Delicious food, and desserts! Warm and cozy atmosphere, and very friendly owners. Mostly gluten free menu. Definitely a must try! $$
1;We ordered lunch online for pick up and doing so got us in and out in a flash.  Unfortunately,  neither my husband or I was happy with our subs. I ordered a hot Turkey and bacon sub with peppercorn Ranch dressing.  My sub was drowning in the peppercorn Ranch which caused the sub roll to be extremely soggy.  I requested the bacon to be extra crispy but the bacon was so thin and fatty I had to take it off.  My husband got a meatball sub. The meatballs were bland and they put on so much sauce that his sub roll was extremely soggy also.  We will not be eating here again.
1;Had shrimp vertuta, sauce was like soup. The chopped salad starter was wilted. What Italian uses feta cheese on pasta and salads anyway. Service was good, food was Horrible! Not even remotely authentic! Never again!
3;I had a really great experience at this resturant.  the food was great.  the bacon thing was not overpowering, and really the best bloody mary ive had in a long time....including bacon.  the resturant also looks really good.
3;Good urban food ( pulled pork is really good and so is the az burger), good atmosphere
0;I don't like this Walmart. It seems to attract a very strange crowd of people. It's also quite small and does not have really anything you need. I would go to another Walmart in the area if you need to do a ton of shopping.
1;We had occasion to try the Carson Street Cafe, located inside the Golden Nugget casino, at about 3:00 A.M. and this review applies only to their late night menu -- which is so sparse as to be almost nonexistent.  There are only about ten items on the menu from 12M-6A and I can rattle them off from memory: Garden salad ($6), Cobb salad ($12), BLT sandwich, club sandwich ($12), open roast beef sandwich ($15), open turkey sandwich ($15).  Pancakes, Belgian waffle ($12), hot cereal ($6).  And that's it.  Reading the previous reviews, as recently as July 2012 someone was able to order an omelet here.  As of today there are no omelettes, eggs (except in a Cobb salad), hamburgers, steaks, chops, bacon (except on a BLT).  No late night specials.  \n\nOne of us had a garden salad and hot beef sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy, one had the Belgian waffle, with drinks the bill came to $38.  The food wasn't bad, the service was sporadic.\n\nMy expectation of a Las Vegas casino coffee shop is, you can get nearly anything you want 24H, this place fell short of my expectations. This being downtown Vegas, I'm sure there's a much better selection of late night fare to be had within a few hundred yards.
1;Excellent selection of juices but unfortunately the shop didn't feel very accessible to me.  For the amount of money I was spending on juice, I was expecting a little more friendly service.  I won't be going back.
1;"I've been coming here for years. I find this location to be a great place for a pedicure. Yesterday I made an appointment with my usual nail tech and when I arrived today the main girl Ann said \""Kim no work here anymore\"". WHAT??  WHY wasn't I told this when I made my appointment??  I've been coming here for years!!  Very unprofessional and rude. They lost a customer."
1;You will be the 10th person in line and you will wait for only 2 tellers to get to you. And wait you shall...
0;"I heard a lot of good words about this place but I ended up having a terribly experience here so forgive me if this review sounds like more of a rant.\n\nPerhaps I just caught them on a bad day, but even still, it was quite possibly the worst Chinese dining experience I ever had.  I went on a Sunday at around 5PM. The place is really dark inside and i wish they had more lights on (Since there are lots of lights that were turned off).  It felt like a bar inside. \n\nThe hostess was very nice, but after about 10 minutes waiting for someone to take my order, or heck, even bring me water or tea, I was starting to get frustrated already.  There were only about 4 other tables occupied, and I was wondering what the holdup was.  Eventually the hostess came back over to me and asked if I was still waiting to get my order taken.  I said yes, no one has come yet.  She said she would take my order and give it to my waitress. \n\nI was thinking, why can't my waitress just take it???  Regardless, I gave my order to the hostess, and she walked to the back of the room where my waitress was sitting the whole time reading a newspaper.  (Maybe she was on a break?)  She gave the order to her, and this somehow turned into the hostess screaming across the room to me.. \""What did you order again?!\"" \n\nI was appalled but regardless I yelled back my order across the room.  Apparently, she couldn't hear and yelled again and asked if I said chicken or pork.  I was getting really bugged.  This is not the way ordering should work.  *facepalm.   I said chicken loudly across the room again, and finally I see the hostess go into the kitchen with my order, not my waitress! \n\nThe hostess brought out my soup, and i asked her if she was going to be my waitress and she said no, \""I'm just the hostess and your waitress is back there.\""  To make matters more confusing, a different waitress brought me my tea I have been waiting on.  I was regretting my decision to come here, but the soup was actually OK, and despite the horrible service thus far, if the rest of my food was good, I would be happy. That's all i wanted after all, just some good Chinese food.  \n\nI had ordered the Peking chicken, but I saw my waitress bring back something that definitely didn't look like Peking chicken (since its one of my favorite dishes other places) and when she set it down on my table, it looked and smelled horrible.  I asked if it was Peking chicken, and she said yes.  Anyway, the smell was really nasty.  Somewhat like a strong ketchup smell, and unfortunately, it tasted even nastier.  The chicken was extremely fatty and I couldn't even guess if it was chicken.  I really don't think it was.  The sauce it was swimming in was horrible too and like its smell, pretty much tasted like a strong concoction of ketchup and sugar.... It was the most horrible thing I tasted I couldn't finish more then half of it, and they don't give you much at all. \n\nIf I had liked the dish, I would say it was very under-portioned compared to what you are used to getting at Chinese restaurants. At the end of my meal, I had such a horrible taste in my mouth, I just wanted to leave as soon as possible, chew gum, brush my teeth, or purge myself.  It was that bad. \n\nBut I needed my bill.  Likewise, no one checked on me my whole meal, and now no one was bringing my bill.  My waitress was still sitting in the back of the room reading the newspaper, so i alerted the hostess to get my bill, and she went to the back of the room, got the bill off the waitress and the hostess brought it back to me!  What the heck!  My waitress didn't do anything. \n\nI left and slipped the hostess a few dollars, and I'll never go back again. Worst Chinese food I ever had, bad service, and under portioned. I don't say this often since people have varying opinions on what is good, but I really would say avoid this restaurant."
1;Whoever the new owner of this branch just lost a business. We used to frequent here for the all-you-can-eat promo from 2-9pm 24/7 but with the new management and staff, nah. Meh.
4;While I frequent the Safeway in the shopping center on Indian School and 48th Street quite often, I never made it a priority to go into this nail salon... but when Jared suggested we go get pedicures on a recent Sunday afternoon, we decided to pay Ken a visit.  \n\nBy the time we made our way there, it was around 5pm and I questioned whether they'd still be open.  But sure enough, they allowed us to walk right in... service was prompt, friendly, and quality - not only did we both get pedicures, but we treated ourselves to more than the basic.  I went for a sugar scrub and J had a salt scrub.  In addition, my nail tech helped me to carefully get a sliver of glass out of my foot that I'd stepped on the day before and was continuing to cause me a lot of pain.  Not anymore - all good now!  And a week and a half later, my toes are still looking pretty.  (Well, as pretty as they can look for my toes!)\n\nThanks Ken and staff for taking such good care of us.  It may have been our first visit, but it won't be our last.\n\nKen offers reasonable prices and an adorable little spa pedicure chair for kids too!
4;Good breakfast restaurant! The chicken florentine is really good as well as the colorado omlet. Sandy an excellent waitress is very friendly and thorough please ask for her and leave a generous tip!
0;The easiest thing to say about this store is: Don't Bother.\n\nYes, that's harsh but sadly true.  This location is the closest to my house, I'm here pretty often dropping off my old junk, err, my awesome stuff I don't need anymore, so I've watched some great stuff being loaded into that store but whenever I go in to have a look for myself there is NOTHING.  Where does it all go?  I've tried going on weekends, weekdays, mornings and nights - doesn't matter.  Crap, crap, crap.  The parking sucks, it's a messy store, seems a little funky, and it's just a bummer, you know?  \n\nSave yourself the trip ... nothing to see here, folks!
4;"aaahhhhhhhh-mazing! I bought a \""groupon-now\"" for a hot stone massage, which I have never had before but have heard great things so I thought I would give it a try. Rabina was fantastic! She was so enthusiastic about her job and helping other people that I was really touched by that sincerity - I wish I could like my job that much! She did a wonderful job relieving stress and relaxing me after a tough day of work. I will definitely go back! Its a little tricky to find - you have to drive through the maze of white buildings in this little office complex and they are all the way in the back."
4;"I ate dinner at \""Canal Street\"" in Las Vegas, NV on 10/6/2012.  It was my first time there.  Canal Street is located inside the Orleans Casino.  I had their Four Onion Soup for $6.00 and their Chicken Scaloppini Rustica for $21.00 (which includes a house salad).  All the food was wonderful.  It was probably the best meal that I ever had in Las Vegas (and I've had many).  The mural with the riverboat Natchez make for a beautiful setting and I had great service by my waiter Abel as well."
1;The show was scheduled for 9:30pm.  We arrived at 9:10pm and were left in an entry room with a bar with only one bartender and a never-ending line.  It would have taken until the 4th of July to get a cocktail.  Plus, as people kept coming in, there was less and less room to stand (all stools were already occupied).  In addition, the room temp got hotter and hotter.  Finally, at 945pm they opened the door to the main show room and that was complete chaos.  We were given a Group # but it was almost like a bum rush to get out of this packed entry room into the main room and to a table.  No one seated us as people were just scrambling to sit wherever.  I've been to a lot of comedy clubs and this entry process from walking inside to finally getting a table on our own was a first...and completely unorganized and not professional.\n\nAlso, at our table, after having a couple of cocktails, I asked the waiter for an ice water and he said the owner's rule is no ice waters, only bottle water for purchase.  (It's not as if my table wasn't purchasing drinks all night.  I just wanted a glass of water towards the end of the show.). Thanks.  That was awesome.\n\nHH's set was way too long, drawn out and it took him forever to get to a punch line which most of the night he missed on badly.  The guy has some talent, but he needs to pick it up and get on and off the stage.  Focus less on being on stage forever and more on running a better operation is my suggestion as a customer.  Leave the comedy to the comics who are brought in.\n\nAs for the comics, The opener was very good.  And the headliner (Cash) was great.  The service by our waiter was also very good with the exception of the request for one glass of ice water.\n\nGroupon or not, probably will not be back.
4;"Didn't know what to expect...\nWent at the end of April with some friends.  Our Captain, Patrick was the lead captain of the company.  I must say, he was very witty and easy going as well as knowledgeable.  I was a little leery about going up so high but the whole process was so gradual (going up) that it was not as bad as I thought.  \nThe gondola is quite large as well as high (another story if you're 6'6\"").  \nWe woke up at crack of dawn and made it to the shuttle.  Surprisingly, there were several shuttles and they were all full.  As we got near the site, the driver pulled over and communicated with the company and decided to head to another launch site.  They said that the original site was too windy.  \nAt the launch site, it is amazing to see how efficient the crews are.  They have fun but work hard.  They don't waste time, which in our case was nice.  We were able to make it up as the sun came up.  Beautiful and breathtaking.  \nWe made it to about 6500 feet.  (FYI: Captain Patrick holds the record for the highest flight).\nLanding was a little different than I thought.  Patrick walked us through it about how bumpy it was going to get and that we might end up with a tilted gondola.  They had crews waiting on the ground and as soon as we landed, they were right on top of the gondola to keep it upright.  (kinda like going on a roller coaster ride :)\nAfter we got off, the crew set off to set up for our champagne brunch.  The food was DELICIOUS!  The pastry and the quiche along with the apples and the OJ (didn't have the champagne but others said it was really good).  Top notch service and experience.  \nYou won't regret it- even if you're afraid of heights.  :)"
2;Everything on the menu except for the sandwiches is overpriced. And the service needs a serious upgrade. For years, the consistency has been the careless staff and quite frankly, the food isn't good enough for me to put up with it more than a few times a year.\n\nTry to call in your take out order, but good luck getting them to pick up the phone.\nWhen you enter, if there's anyone else waiting, beware that you'll probably get ignored by all four employees who will inexplicably assume you are with the other customer- even though you guys walked in separately, minutes apart, and look nothing alike.\n\nEventually you'll ask someone if you can place an order for takeout, and they'll act irritated that they have to give you a menu. They'll also give you the dinner-only menu that doesn't include the sandwiches, you'll have to ask again for it.\n\nWhen you finally get to this point, your pita sandwich can be made with falafel, shwarma, koobideh, or a couple other things. The first two are your best bet. Be aware that upgrading your wrapping to laffa will be an extra $2.50. \n$10 and a side of fries is decent for the wrap, which is packed with tahini, cabbage, Israeli salad, and the world's tiniest dab of hummus, but it's hella filling and can easily be your main meal of the day even without the fries.\n\nIf you dine in, the all-you-can-eat salad for $3, added on to your meal, is a great deal...but be sure you will actually have room for it. And as others have said, the entire table needs to order it for you to be able to partake- if you're with more than one other person, it likely isn't worth it.
1;Their combo meals suck you, don't have a choice what you want in it. Also their chicken adobo sucks. If their chicken is their specialty then why does the chicken adobo taste different from the sauce which also sucks.
3;We called beforehand, asked about what colors and sizes were available. Store manager picked up the phone and was very helpful.\n\nStan was awesome-/efficient and resourceful, knew exactly what he was dealing with.\n\nWent in with shoes, made it easier to pick out.
2;We decided to try this place after a recommendation and several reminders from our favorite server at Carpe Diem.  \n\nThe quality of food at Akahana matched my expectations.  I rarely have high expectation for restaurants that have huge menus and broad food styles.  Akahana serves up the usual suspects from the usual Asian countries, and they do an admirable--though definitely not spectacular--job with their food.  \n\nMy pho was tasty.  I've certainly had much, much better pho, but, as previously mentioned, I never expected to consume the best of anything here.  Ginny had a few sushi rolls, all of which I considered to be on par with similar items at Sushi 101. \n\nIf you're in the area and you're hungry for a decent meal, Akahana fits the bill.  If your expectation is to have the most fabulous Asian dish you've ever experienced, this will not fit the bill.
0;"After my last visit, I have to wonder why anyone would spend their money at this restaurant.  With the many FINE quality burger joints In the area, this by far is sub par.  Once a nice place to take the family is now run by a crew of misfits starting at the top.  When taking one step in this eatery it's painfully obvious there is tension among the staff, making for an uncomfortable experience from the get go.  I over heard fowl language from \""Savana\""?  I believe her name was.  When I have a small child with me this is not what I want them to hear.  I asked another employee who was tending to the condiment station who was the manager and they pointed to a short blond young woman who's appearance left something to be desired.  I decided then & there I would observe before speaking with her...just as I thought.  She too conducted herself like a child & not like a leader. I have spent the better of 30 years in a profession where I was required to notice small details. These details tell a lot about a person, situation or environment. Fuddruckers fell short in all areas. If the \""feel\"" is off when u enter a place the meal is less enjoyable. I hardly noticed the quality of food because i was so put off by the first 10 minutes. The food was somewhat enjoyable, but nothing like it used to be. I feel as though if I'm going to pay 12 bucks for a burger meal, it should be served to me. (I can go across the street & get a nice steak dinner for 10 bucks!) With that being said, if everything is spectacular, these are the little things I'd over look. The charm of the place, if u will...I can get a cheaper, better tasting burger in 5 other places with in a mile of Fudds.  Overall this place need a complete makeover from management to menu.  If u don't care about your restaurant then why should I?  I sure hope this place can be saved,  it once was a great fun family spot!"
0;This Place sucks! Terrible service from novice hipster waiters. It took an hour to get a few tacos and it cost around $50/person for what should've been a $10 meal. \nWanted to Love it but ended up hating it!
1;"With high expectations we ventured to Pinky's to satisfy a craving for burgers and fried food.\n\n1) No one got sick\n\n2) Service was good\n\n3) Order was correct, no mistakes\n\n4) Ambiance - fun!\n\n5) Parking in a bail bonds parking lot. Thumbs up!\n\n\nHowever, the burgers were \""meh.\"" If this is a top burger in Charlotte, then I feel bad for the people of Charlotte. The burgers are a tad overcooked, but maybe that's the law.\n\nFried pickles - high expecations - and they were juicy, but the batter didn't add to the dish. Meh.\n\nCrab hugh puppies - well, oddly addictive, but its like a cheap crab fried cake balls.\n\nWaffle fries - we thought these were the best thing about our meal."
3;"Mojo is one of the new wave yogurt spots, where you serve yourself. \nYou grab a colorful tub and help yourself to a wide range of flavors and toppings. The texture and tart flavors are real stand outs.\n\nThe Mojo staff at the end of the self serve line, gives you a colorful fun spoon and a friendly smile & \""Thank you!\"" That amiable service is a nice touch, that drives repeat business.\n\nThis is a long narrow place, with great colors - small red tiles, dark wood panels, colorful flooring and the Mojo team wears fun complimentary outfits."
3;Went here for breakfast and dinner. Breakfast was better then dinner but both were over priced for what it was. Cool place and nice atmosphere. Patio looks amazing but it's been to hot to use it the couple times I have gone. I would say try it out at least once.
0;"We were quite excited to find a facility that offered 'puppy socialization' but the excitement quickly turned to disappointment last week when we brought our 16-week old to a session (BTW, our pup is only about 22 pounds, hardly a \""bruiser\"").  The idea is to allow the puppies to play and interact with each other; however, before the class began, the owner took our dog, along with another puppy (about the same size dog) and, without explanation, kept both puppies on leashes, severely limiting their ability to play with the other dogs.  Note - neither our dog or the other showed any sign of being aggressive or too 'physical' - they were both showing normal if not subdued behavior for puppies.  What was most distressing was that, while he was limiting their ability to play, he actually dragged our dog (flipping him over a time or two against my puppy's will) while he was looking elsewhere at other dogs.  He kept the two dogs on leashes for the entire session so they barely had a chance to play without any explanation why.  What was particularly galling is, halfway through the session, he gave our dog back to us to keep with us (doing the same with the other puppy) while he and his staff sat on the floor in the middle of the room with all the other puppies and played/interacted with them.  We were made to feel like our dog was abnormal or a problem - it was quite insulting.  The advice I would give is, if your dog is over 10 pounds, don't bother....they doted on the very small dogs."
2;Vegas is a scene of fine dining and buffets but if you want some cheap and fast diner style food, this place is not a bad choice. This place is neither are bar nor is it fresh but for under 10 bucks you can get a filling meal. They have basic stuff like burgers, wraps and quesadilla plates which come with sides. Basically they serve good drunk food and in Vegas, that is not a bad idea.
1;This review is for the wireless booth in the store.\n\nHeard purchasing a phone here vs. through my service provider is cheaper and you get some extras like a case and a car charger. This is true, I believe I saved around $50 on the phone.\n\nThe complimentary case was cheap and I threw it in the trash. The car charger will definitely be useful.\n\nThe guys working the booth are very nice, helpful,and PATIENT. I witnessed them dealing with several non savvy wireless customers.\n\nWhy I won't buy here again...the supervisor running.the booth transferred my contacts over only after I asked him to do so. Then he transferred them over in some round about way so I had to accept all of my contacts 1 by 1, going through a menu page each time. After a couple of days I noticed some of my contacts didn't make it through the transfer. So to the Verizon store I go.to get the job done right. Plus at the Verizon store they go above and beyond explaining the basics of your phone before you leave. \n\nI also had to wait a few days to get my phone. It was more than the 2 day delivery that they advertise. However this didn't bother me especially since I just saved some dough. The fact that I had to go back to the store to activate my phone didn't bother me either. The unefficient transferring of my contacts and no regard to explain anything about my phone did bother me.\n\nLesson learned, pay the extra money and get everything done the same day, and go home happy and complete.
4;Love this place...\n\nToday original  orange dream... Parmesan pretzel and a bottle of water...\nPerfect way to start the day - when ever I need a boost of energy. I come to Jamba Juice and have a energy boost in my favorite drink... They have all kinds of  yummy drinks - there even serving coffee and tea
1;I have been a member here for many years.  Lately, it has gone downhill.  The equipment is frequently broken, despite complaints from the members.  One of the best spin instructors left because of this issue.  It is extremely hot in the cardio area - too uncomfortable to work out.\n\nI would recommend going somewhere else!
4;"When I say I'm going to the park, this is the park to which I am going.  It's a beautiful, amply forested piece of land, with a large dog park and some interesting and challenging trails.  My usual routine involves taking my fuzzy four-legged companion around the long Sierra Loop trail. I enjoy the scenery and peace; he enjoys the smells and squirrels.  We then end the afternoon at the dog park where he burns off the remainder of his energy and socializes with other canines.  The dog area is equipped with a watering station and a hosing-down station.\n\nThe lakes are good fishing, if you're into that sort of thing.  The nature center is charming and has a classroom for kid-oriented educational activities.  There's also a gift shop, so buy a tee shirt and support the facility!  \n\nA final point of interest is the farmhouse ruins off the main trail... if you can manage to sneak out there with no one else around, it's quite tranquil.\n\nReedy Creek Park is one of Charlotte's treasures!"
2;Our first visit here was only a few days after they had some CDC issues - we were later to find out. Perhaps that added to the weird.\n\nThe front desk clerk was not very nice, I mean, technically, nice but the policies were pretty lame and she wasn't very polite about explaining them to us newbies.\n\nThey ask you to leave a deposit equal to somewhere in the range of $125 per day pre-charged on your credit card to be able to charge anything to your room and apparently, one of the promotions they were running with a free buffet a day was tied to this deposit.  Since we were there for 6 days that was TOO much money to have tied up in one place for us so we opted not to do that. It made getting the promotion a huge pain, the cashiers at the buffet had to call the front desk each time.\n\nI would have likely spent much more $ if that deposit wasn't so steep. We ended up paying as we went, which isn't good for them, that second $25 drink by the pool (granted, they're HUGE) would have seemed a lot easier to order if I was just signing a bill rather than pulling out cash or a card.\n\nThe rooms, however, were really nice and the beds are as comfy as previously reported. Shower set up is in front of a large soaking tub, with the sinks and mirror in front, toilet to the side behind another sliding glass door. Figuring out the remote is tricky for the first day, then it's fine.\n\nThe pool area is great though, just stay away from the one near liquid as it gets WAY TOO LOUD. I also found that by the weekend, it was too 'Jersey Shore' party central at the back pool for my liking, from about 11am and on, it was too crowded and trashy for me.\n\nThe rest of the hotel is fine and good, the decor is a bit manic, but the stand out employees were the bell staff and the pool security guy, both of them were AWESOME.\n\nStill, there was an additional charge of about $30/day to use the spa area - hot/cold pools and such- since we normally stay at the Red Rock and it's included in the daily 'resort charge' this seemed lame. There's still a resort charge of $20 a day but it's just a glorified tax, it's not like it's optional.
2;I think I've moved on from the Venetian.  While it is still a very nice place to stay at, the last 2 times I've been, I was a little disappointed in overall upkeep.  I mean it's nothing bad compared to the 3-4 stars on the strip but for 5 star price, you expect a certain 5 star quality.  I found the carpet to be a little dirty and the concierge experience a hit or miss.  I would call to ask about getting on the club guest list for Tao and one person would say no and give me attitude and talk about how it's a busy weekend and nothing is free.  I would hang up and call back and the next person would be totally nice and add us to the list.  Weird.  Also another weird thing is they charge you to bring you hot water.  I thought i remember them having coffee pots before.  \n\nEncore is my new love.  Good bye forever.
4;I have used Signature West multiple times over the past 5 years for both commercial use (a church property) and my personal residence.  I couldn't be more pleased with the quality of service they provide nor with the professional manner in which they provide.  \n\nThe church property I managed had the unfortunate experience of a flood - our hot water heater burst - ON A SATURDAY NIGHT!  1.5 inches of water across the entire facility.  They stopped the water flow, sucked up the water, cut out drywall, and got the building to a place where we could have church service by morning.  All the damage was completely repaired by the following week's church service!\n\n Fast!  High Quality!  Reasonably Priced!  CALL THEM!
3;It's a movie theatre. I mean, you show up, buy tickets, watch a movie. They do a great job of this. They are even 50 cents per ticket cheaper than the larger Harkins Theatres in the area as well.\n\nThe place isn't glamorous or all that big as it's one of the older locations. However, that makes it far less popular so you don't have to arrive as far in advanced as you would with the bigger more popular theaters. It also shows a lot of the smaller/indie films which can be a gem.
4;The salt and pepper shrimp is outstanding, the flavor is like nothing I've had before.  Highly recommend that dish.  The orange chicken is also very good, if you like spicy chicken get the spicy fried chicken!  It's crispy yet chewy, great texture.  The fried cheese wontons and the dumplings are classic, you can't go wrong with this place.\n\nThey deliver as well!  Be sure to ask for the free soda is you order delivery!
0;"Perfect place to ruin a Saturday night. Unfortunately I've been in this place twice. \n\n-It's famous as a Gin place, but they don't serve Martini! \n-The beer selection is poor, expensive and mediocre (if you like Stella and Heineken you might disagree). I ordered a pint of \""a fin du monde\"" and the beer was spoiled in lines.\n-They have a dance place upstairs and the D.J. know how not to play good music.\n-They have some one whose job is to walk around and ask people where to put their stuff. The second time I was there he almost annoyed everyone in the second floor. A true wet blanket if I may."
0;My twin moms friends were staying for the weekend at the resort, and since they didn't want to drive for dinner, they decided to dine at Orange Sky.  This review was going to be a 2 star, but after my horrible night, it definitely is a one.  It is not only that the prices are high, but the food is nothing special.  I like to eat and I couldn't find anything I really wanted.  I decided to order the beet salad, it was ok, but I had great ones in so many other places.  I should have stopped there and call it the night.  But since some of my girlfriends were ordering the Restaurant week menu, we had some more time to kill.  I asked to the Artichoke potato au gratin.  Big mistake.  It is really big size and I am glad I only ate half of it.  After that I felt I had a brick in my stomach.  I left my girlfriends around 10p.m. and I went home.  I couldn't sleep, I was so uncomfortable, and nauseous. Stop here if you don't want to be grossed out.  By 3:30 I couldn't take it and I was kneeling in front of my toilet.  It all came out undigested.  I was glad, but my throat was in pain.  Yuk! By the way I only had two glasses of wine.
1;This must be the first hotel in Las Vegas. We stayed here over a weekend and the best part about it is that Fremont St is in front of the hotel. I would rather stay at the Circus Circus with the millions of kids runny around. This place is OLD and every where in the hotel it smells like smoke. Its also very dark and the gray hound station is next door so keep you eyes open. I would not recommend to anyone, they should close an remodel.
2;"Beer selection is outstanding and would give the choices 5 stars, but unfortunately for the good beer choices you have to be ok with sub par service.  \n\nThe different styles of beer they have to choose from is impressive. They have something for everyone from the novice beer drinker to the beer aficionado!! As far as beer temps. I did notice some\nBeers are colder than other, but it wasn't something that bothered me to much as it wasn't that big of a deal. \n\nAs for the service, let's just say they do the bare minimum. No one was rude, but they weren't friendly either.  For me if a place is known for hundreds of beer choices I would think the staff would be excited about promoting them and getting patrons to try new things, but NOPE not here.  Didn't feel very welcoming.  Just gave off a \""meh\"" vibe. \n\nI'll stop by again for a quick beer \""if\"" I'm in the area, but won't be a frequent visitor."
3;Always good food at the Rio Buffet so many choices and variety of food. The waiter was so nice and the workers were great. Although I was disappointed I ordered a drink with a souvenir cup and it didn't have no logo or anything on it but on the menu the cup had the Rio hotel & casino logo on it
1;Mediocre at best. The food was very oily (who fries an avocado??) and the service was poor. Unfortunately, the ambience wasn't nice enough either to justify returning.
3;I'll just jump straight to the food.\n\nRib lunch special http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/top-notch-barbeque-las-vegas-2?select=UjvGENIgFgBueatCI_Yj5w#UjvGENIgFgBueatCI_Yj5w\nThe picture says it all, a large pile of seasoned fries with probably 3 of the better ribs I've had in town. There was a delicious, slightly crisp layer from the dry rub melting with some fat on the rib. There was another delicious layer from the slight pink smoke ring under that. I dont like to much smoke in BBQ. The meat was fall of the bone but firm enough to my liking. I added a little of their spicy sauce just to try the sauce but it really didn't need it it was made right. I wish I had more of the rib but occasionally they run out.\n\nNachos http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/top-notch-barbeque-las-vegas-2?select=UjvGENIgFgBueatCI_Yj5w#RAXIeZU1KTHVAqPPv3R84w\nA huge pile of what seemed and tasted like the packaged nacho chips, some good pulled pork and your typical nacho ingredients olives, jalapeno peppers, sour cream, cheese, etc. Not a big fan probably because of the chips but it was a huge nacho and it was decent. \n\nCincinnati Chili Cheese Fries http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/top-notch-barbeque-las-vegas-2?select=GBHyE6-bCmB5QgYc6lf_xQ#GBHyE6-bCmB5QgYc6lf_xQ\nA very delicious chili filled with lots of meat with oozing cheese covering a pile of fries. It was a side dish but large enough to be a meal by itself. This and the ribs were my favorite items here.\n\nHot Link Sandwich http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/top-notch-barbeque-las-vegas-2?select=GBHyE6-bCmB5QgYc6lf_xQ#gvXrXCOe4P73HGcFFq_OWQ They were out of the usual bun so they split the links and put them between a couple of Texas Toast, which I actually  preferred over the bun. It wasn't that bad, a little dry but I enjoyed it more than the nachos.\n\nBrisket. A lot like the ribs delicious outer layer from the rub and fat, another good smoke ring but kind of dry with not a lot of flavor towards the center. I've had a lot better briskets but it was good enough.\n\nService for some reason has always been slow. It's BBQ shouldn't it already be finish and ready to go before we get there? Cut my pieces off and give me my BBQ already. Busy or not it seems like it always takes the same amount of time to get in and out. Their lunch specials are a lot cheaper than dinner, dinner prices aren't cheap. The ribs and Cincinnati Chili Cheese Fries were 5's. Everything else was maybe a 3-4. Overall a 3.75 rating. For what it's worth I like Top Notch BBQ ribs a lot more than Rollin Smoke ribs.
4;This is the best Chinese restaurant I have found on Craig Rd. I am very specific about what Chinese food I eat, and they are the only place so far that makes shrimp with lobster sauce the way I like (or at all). My kids rave about the fried rice, no matter what meat is in it, and my husband cannot get enough of the beef and broccoli. The service is always excellent, and everyone that works at the restaurant has a great personality. This is probably the only Chinese restaurant we will go to while we live here.
4;These guys have been my plumbers for years and for good reason. Very trust worthy, punctual and friendly. Always get things done quickly for me and at a great price. I love the fact that they are a family business too.
3;They have a special going on where you can get a large two topping deep dish pizza for $15.95 when it's usually much more than that. We called and ordered ahead of time because their pizzas take 45 minutes to bake.\n\nOur pizza had pepperoni and sausage on it. The sausage was homemade, and it tasted delicious. The pepperoni had a little spicy taste to it just how I liked it. The crust was amazing. It was really chewy without being overly doughy... if you can even comprehend that. The large was huge! There were three of us, and 4 slices were consumed of it. Over half the pizza was left over, and it tasted good heated up the next day.\n\nWe also ordered mozerella sticks... except they weren't sticks. They were triangles! They were triangles of gooey, crispy, mozerella goodness. I have never had better mozerella sticks ever. We should have ordered 8 instead of 4. \n\nThe atmosphere was nice. There was some Italian music playing in the background, a bunch of baseball/football/chicago in general memorabilia throughout the restaurant.\n\nThe place was dead though. Only one other person came in while we were dining, which is a shame for a place with good pizza. I will definitely be back.
4;I've had numerous massages of different modalities in various cities over the years and Jill really is exceptional.  I don't have any major body issues, but I work long hours on my feet and I get tweaks here and there.  Jill is a professional, so she's going to have you fill out a health questionnaire and ask about various areas of your body.  Only all natural and/or organic products are used.  Lying on a heated massage table during winter was so soothing.  During my treatments, Jill would use various hot compresses to get my knots to loosen up.  I liked the way she'd incorporate a bit of reflexology into the treatments too.  Sessions were overall relaxing but she's not afraid to go deeper into problem areas.  Afterwards, I'd sleep like a baby and felt able to move much easier the next day.  If you can afford to go with the 90 minute massage, it is well worth it.
3;"When my friend told me a \""Hot N Juicy Crawfish\"" opened up on Eastern Avenue, I was thrilled!  I've always wanted to go but the other locations were a bit far for me.  So, me, my boyfriend and a friend of mine decided to have lunch here after church yesterday. I'm very happy we chose this place!  We were greeted and seated right away.  The staff was very friendly and attentive, always making sure we were being taken care of and had everything we needed.  Being that it was our first time, the waitress kindly explained the menu to us and told us all about the sauces and their intensity.  We ordered 2 dozen oysters and each had 2 pounds of crawfish as well.  The oysters were very clean and a good size.  With a little lemon juice and cocktail sauce, they were pretty tasty.  I ordered the crawfish with the Hot n Juicy \""mild\"" sauce.  I was told that if I liked spicy that I should \""kick it down a notch\"" because their sauces are one step up.  They weren't kidding.  The mild sauce had a nice bite to it.  I suggest if you don't like anything spicy, order \""less than mild\"" sauce.  The bag of crawfish also comes with a potato and small corn cobb.  We didn't wait long for our food and began our crawfish adventure.  Before digging into my bag of hot n juicy goodness, I made sure to put on the recommended gloves and my plastic bib.  Once suited up, I opened the bag, pulled out one of the spicy crustaceans and went to town.  The crawfish were just like the name says, hot n juicy!  The mild sauce was a bit spicy, but nothing I couldn't handle. I actually like a little fire to my meals.  The crawfish were easy to peel,but very messy.  Thank goodness for the gloves and paper towels!  I devoured most of the bag, leaving just  a small amount on the bottom.  I liked the Hot N Juicy sauce, which is a mixture of all of the sauces on the menu, but I would like to try some of the other sauces on their own. All in all, I was not disappointed.  My friends and I really enjoyed our lunch at Hot N Juicy Crawfish and will definitely be back again real soon!"
1;There are a select few nail techs that do a  good job here. The rest are mediocre at best. Have left not satisfied  the past few times so I won't be back due to inconsistency.
2;"Hayashi is recently under new management.  The new owner was extremely involved and going from place to place throughout the night.  Our chef was a little on the sloppy side, not something I am used to at a Japanese restaurant. (He wasn't Asian.)  ;)   The food was a little bland, and it wasn't just my food, the wife felt the same way.  The atmosphere was actually quite festive.  We could have done without the loud drum they use for singing happy birthday for everyone.  Since when does EVERY SINGLE restaurant have to sing happy birthday??  And I was a little shocked when the bill came.  It was a little on the high side, even for teppanyaki.  But what drops my rating for this restaurant is that in their efforts to draw in a crowd, they got a DJ that plays music very loudly on Friday and Saturday nights.  Imagine our surprise, leaving a Japanese restaurant and hearing booty music.  I don't know.  I just think it will attract the wrong clientele.  Just my opinion.  There is much to be said for a place that embraces the heritage of the food and not just the food itself."
0;Really don't recommend to shop in this store. Lots of foods are expired and still on the shelf for sale.
2;This chipotle is brutal when there are more than 5 people in line. The workers need to be retrained to move a little more quickly. Also, way too often the chicken is overlooked and you end up getting black crunchy pieces in your dish. This is very unpleasant and tastes horrible. The people are very nice and overall the food is delicious but a lack of training is evident.
3;My wedding cake was made by Freed's. It was three tiers, two tiers were red velvet and the third almond cake with almond mousse. The red velvet was not impressive at all. I thought it was really dry but the hubby insisted on that flavor and since he really didn't ask for a lot during wedding planning, I thought it was fair. The almond cake was HEAVEN. Words can not describe my love for this cake. The texture was soft and airy, perfect level of sweetness. I will definitely be ordering this cake again.
4;I'm a big fan of their strawberry water and if I'm looking for a better lunch than what I have at home I'll swing by and pick up a salad from here.  They have a good selection- and it's constantly expanding.
2;"I had high expectations - the friends I went with have raved about this place for years. And true to their word we received a warm greeting from the owner and good service throughout the meal. The decor is basic, but experience has taught me that this is rarely reflected in an Indian kitchen so my expectations kept climbing.\n\n\n Then the menu; all the standards, but a few dishes I had never encountered before and which were screaming out to be tried. I plumped for the Balti Chasni Gosht, a curry that promised lots of heat and flavour. Ah well, being let down by a curry is probably not the worst thing that will ever happen to me, but the sadness still lingers.. I have heard rumours of such practises, but had never before had first hand experience of what lurked in the bottom of my balti dish: Pre-cooked lamb dropped into a goo of a curry sauce and reheated. The lamb was horrid, the sauce okish, though it had a disconcerting flavour of fish.\n\n\n If the meal hadn't been a treat from my hosts I would have said something, but I didn't. So I am now.\n\n\n The stars are for the service, the prices and the hope that this was an off night."
4;"Time for me to weigh in on the so-called arrival of \""real sushi\"" in Las Vegas. Long story short, Kabuto is phenomenal. If you're looking for traditional Edomaezushi, look no further. You want the freshest of sushi neta flown in from various parts of the world each day? Do you dream of meticulously constructed nigiri with just the right amount of real wasabi and a brush of aged shoyu? Your search has ended.\n\nEvery aspect of Kabuto oozes excellence. The exterior is very unassuming and elegant in its simplicity. No gaudy signs. No sign at all, in fact. Just a small window strip display lets you know you've arrived at the right place. This simple elegance continues with the interior decor. Nothing seems out of place. Do yourself a favor and sit at the beautiful cypress sushi bar. This is where the magic happens.\n\nThe quality of product is only half the story at Kabuto. There is something truly captivating about watching a highly skilled Itamae (that's probably redundant) prepare these edible works of art. Do yourself another favor--eat the nigiri with your hands. This is something I learned a long time ago, but Kabuto is the first place that I truly felt like it was the only way to go.\n\nNow about this \""real sushi\"" business, if I'm not mistaken, sushi refers to the vinegared rice. I hazard to say that the art of sushi has merely evolved. There is a place in this world for AYCE and unagi nigiri and Yum Yum Rolls. (Not that I've ever had a Yum Yum Roll, nor do I know what it even contains, but I like the fact that it seems to be the current Yelp running gag). I mean, as much as people romanticize sushi, it originated as street fast food! Then again, that sounds like fast food heaven to me.\n\nI think I have The Avengers on the brain, but Kabuto is like Captain America. He's a little old fashioned. But as Agent Coulson states, sometimes we need a little old fashioned. Actually, Kabuto is like The Avengers film itself. No matter how elevated your expectations are, you won't walk away disappointed.\n\nJiro dreams of sushi. I daydream of returning to Kabuto."
3;The selection is not as many as I have expected. The plastic lobsters are for display only. The pasta is very salty and the Chinese BBQ dishes look scary. The desserts are top notched so there are extra points for that.
4;This was my first time running Las Vegas and it was great. The Rock n Roll people are well organized and have all of the details worked out. The course is always well marked and aid stations in good locations. \n\nThe course for the half marathon was Mandalay Bay out to Freemont Street and back. I had completed five half marathons prior to this, but had not actually trained until now. The course was excellent and I enjoyed running down the strip - it just goes to show how deceiving Vegas is when you are out walking the strip. Granted, most people don't walk to Freemont, but just walking the strip and back is a good distance. You get sucked in by the buildings and next thing you know, turn around and your hotel is miles away. So it was fun that it was a half marathon and the distance was expected :-) \n\nThe post race concert rocked. Bret Michaels sounded good, the crowd was huge and it was a good time. Speaking of good times - the course was flat and fast. I was pleased to set my best times at 5K, 10K, 10 miles and a PR in the half marathon. \n\nThe weather was great, the crowds were great and I am glad that I could mark Nevada off my 50 state half marathon club punchlist - and complete my second Rock n Roll event in 2010. Good job, Las Vegas!
2;Decent burger, decent fries and sides, competent service.\n\nI've avoided the Burger Bar in San Francisco because of previous disappointment with Hubert Keller's Fleur de Lys in SF (one of The City's most over-rated eateries), but this establishment is both tasty and semi-reasonable (for Vegas).\n\nIf the noise level had been lower they might have gotten another 1/2 star of so, but the all-hard-surface dining room is very noisy when full.
4;"I tried a number of high-rated, supposedly hip and creative salons in town, only to be disappointed again and again by stylists that just didn't get me or what I wanted.  I was sad and frustrated with hairstylists that either made me look like a soccer mom or tried too hard to make me look what they thought was \""rock and roll\"".  I even thought about commuting back to my stylist in LA for haircuts!\n\nI've been going to Globe for probably 2-3 years now and am ever-so-thankful that I finally found them!  Samantha is amazing!  I like to change up my style every now and then (I get bored - must be my punk rock roots) and she's always ready to build on my ideas with suggestions that look great!  Creative and just a darn enjoyable person to chat with while getting a great cut - I can't recommend Sam enough.  She has really helped me redefine my personal style and keeps me looking cool as I get older."
0;We just went there to have persian food. It took 2 hours for them to bring our food, we ordered koobideh and shish kabob. The food was so bad, specifically shish kabob that we could not eat it at all. I don't recommend this place to any one.
3;We had a large table of 8, and it was a very nice experience all around.  Typical Las Vegas steakhouse prices.  Also, in typical fashion, the room was rather loud.  Food, service, and ambience, were all very good.  We will return.
0;I really hate to do this.  This restaurant is fit for those that think Taco Bell is a great place for Mexican food.\n\nThe buffet was pathetic and contained maybe 12 items (no white rice).  My sampling of their offerings ranged from terrible to mediocre.  China Garden has, hands down, the worst eggroll I've eaten.\n\nGiven the atmosphere of the place it was plain to see China Garden had regulars.  One guy at the cashier even commented that he'd been coming since 1970.  I don't get it.  This is the worst restaurant I have ever dined at.\n\nThe staff and whom I presumed to be the owner/manager was nice and friendly but that cannot make up for the poor quality of selection and food.
0;Having visited The Barrymore twice previously for lunch, I was looking forward to giving it a shot for dinner. Unfortunately, bad service and below average food ensure I won't be returning for a fourth time. \n\nOur group received slow service every step of the way. Despite the restaurant being 3/4 empty, we had a long wait to be seated, receive menus, have our orders taken, receive our food and get the check. We had to ask for a drink menu and bread. We had long stretches when our server was nowhere in sight. \n\nI ordered the filet cooked medium. It was raw. Others in our group also received their food undercooked. \n\nI liked The Barrymore as a hidden gem away from the bustle of the Strip, but after this experience I won't return and will quit recommending it to others.\n\n\nUpdate: Management from The Barrymore contacted me as a result of this review in an effort to get more information and to make things right. I declined the offer for a comped meal, but the genuine concern from management is a good sign that they're trying to do the right thing.
2;Good food for the money.  Located inside the Tuscany Casino.\n\nWe ate here over the course of our three day stay while attending a convention.  Average price ranged from $7-10.   You can't go wrong.\n\nPros - plenty of seating.  Solid American food.  Cheap and plenty.\n\nCons - food served fairly lukewarm like my pancakes and corn beef hash.\n\nOpened 24 hours daily.  Lots of to go orders.
0;Wynn and Encore Casino do next to nothing wrong. The attention to detail in just about everything they do is equal to or better than anything you will find on the strip. Sadly, Red 8 is the single exception. Had a meal here, and was terribly disappointed. Bland, no flavor, nothing interesting about it at all. And being in Las Vegas, of course it was very expensive. Would never go back or advise a good friend to visit. I might suggest my worst enemy enjoy a meal here however.
3;This place was a blast. We played bingo and the drinks were poured well and the service was great! Had a blast and will be back. It's a dive so if you don't like dives don't come here. I love dive bars:-)
1;"It's what you would expect for a casino bar. Crowded, overpriced and slow service. I'm glad to see Vegas showing consistency somewhere.\n\nThe bar has the annoying games in your face at every seat. There is a seating area, but if you're alone and the bar area is where you want to chill be prepared to have your elbow room taken up by those annoying things. I dislike them very, very much. \n\nThe seating area is huge, there is a lot of space, but it's where everyone in the hotel tends to hang out rather than finding a cool bar steps from their faces. Oh well. I was just there to meet friends before going out for dinner and I won't really ever go back to this bar again so no harm no foul. \n\nThe other thing about this bar, and every other bar in Vegas apparently, is that the cigar smoke is horrendous. There is a cigar kiosk right behind this bar so they're at the ready. This means prepare for people you don't know to blow smoke that makes you choke into your face with little regard for people who don't care much for smoke, It's probably one of the worst things about casinos; the inability of people who visit to see their behaviors might affect other people.\n\nAnyway, this bar is pretty cookie cutter. Nothing sets it apart at all from any other casino bar in a hotel. If you want something fun, lively and interesting, step outside the casino for that."
3;"Great facility. I came here since 2006, and still a member.\n\nThe only bad thing is people working out there. No one ever heard of a deodorant. Although, the time to avoid this gym is at the peak hours; do not come around 3:30 PM to 6:30 PM. The benches are always full, and the gym is crowded with people.\n\nThe location is great since it is in the heart of downtown. Staff is very friendly and approachable. Lots of classes and lessons. They have a gym for sports (they have a schedule for that).\n\nYouth center is another plus. It allows young people (18 and under) to gather up and they can relax in the room that has several couches, a pool table, and a foosball table. The youth staff (volunteer I presume) are super friendly, and they promote education and prevention of drugs/violence."
0;Horrible service!  Waiter opened bottle of wine without showing the bottle then did not offer a first taste before filling one glass and walking away.  Not friendly at all, in fact was argumentative.  Water glasses empty many times despite several requests for refills.  We ordered 22 tapas.  The alcachofa and rape la verde were good, the other items  were ok.  Flan was rubbery.  The food wad brought out in a timely manner and was served hot.  Unfortunately, this did not make up for our waiter's sour attitude.  Overall bad experience.  We have had good service and overall better tapas at Iru\u00f1a in old town Scottsdale.
2;Ate a ton of crab legs, always good but they were kind of falling apart as if they were in water for too long (after being cut.)\nOysters were SUPER FRESH and lovely. \nCeviche was delish\n\nBrisket smelled amazing and smokey but it was chewy, I was looking fwd to it falling apart as it should. I got a gigantic piece of fat with little meat :(\nFried chicken good but a little dry / Sweet potato fries were good. \nMashed potatoes were a buttery bomb - SO good.\nMac 'n Cheese a-okay.\nBaked Beans, delish.\nSliders - ridiculously AMAZING\n\nAsian food, just ok, not a lot of flavor and everything kind of tasted the same. \nThe meats were tender though.\nhot & sour was good and super spicy. \nDim Sum kind of been sitting there for a bit - it was late.\nMango juice delish.\n\nDeserts - Amazing. Loved the cheesecakes and mochi ice cream (green tea especially)\n\nBottom line, check was like $200 almost with a bottle of wine (not the best I've tasted but I didn't order it). Left very full but somewhat satisfied.
0;I'm not sure if this even deserves 1 star. What a disappointment!  This place always seemed to be packed and offered lots to do but I was completely disappointed after tonight's visit. I think the food was way overpriced even for Scottsdale and it was NOT very good at all.   I can understand paying $24 for chicken wings if they are really good, but really some were undercooked and with no flavor. The bartender has no clue, who doesn't know how to make an Irish car bomb?  (Order that 3 separate times and screwed up every time even after we tried to tell him the correct recipe after the first time). And with all the staff they have walking around the management was terrible and completely inexperienced. I spent over $400 in the 3 1/2 hrs that myself & 3 others were there and I will NEVER go back there. With the amount of money you guys make I hope you hire better, more experienced, knowledgeable people that can help you improve your establishment. I have to say that Cindy Lou & Austin from Mayland (on his name tag) absolutely made this experience some what decent for us though.
1;This is the first time in a very long time I have stopped at mokis.  I stopped the first week they opened and I would have rated them  3 stars.  Today they only get 2 stars. The first thing I noticed was the strong fish smell. Which almost made me turn and walk out.  now wish I had.  I ordered the 2 meat plate.  I chose Katsu chicken and sticky chicken.  The Katsu was ok and the dipping sauce was good.  The sticky chicken was greasy  and did not have a very good flavor. It came with white rice and a salad. I chose the Hawaiian salad which is pretty good. The company I work for sometimes has catering brought in from mokis and it is better than what I had today.  Maybe it was a bad day? I can still smell the fish odor on my clothes. Yuck!  I'm glad I was on my way home for the day.
4;Came in and did a great job! Very professional with upfront pricing and correspondence. Will be using again when needed.
3;The staff were very nice and the food was great.  The pasta portion sizes are way too large for most humans!
3;A staple dish of downtown Vegas, the shrimp cocktail, is the best item on their menu here.  It's not widely advertised, but it's a heckuva lot better than Lanai's 99 cent shrimp cocktail with teeny weeny shrimp.  Du-Par's $2.99 shrimp cocktail comes in a sundae glass drizzled with tangy and spicy cocktail sauce that really hits the spot.  The shrimp are cold, well-sized, and delicious.  Whenever our hero is downtown and feeling a nip hungry, he tries to stop in for a shrimp cocktail here at the bar.\n\nPROS:\n- They have a legit old time vibe with throwback uniforms and classic decor.\n- Service is fast and friendly.\n- Prices are value oriented.\n- Their $2.99 shrimp cocktails are the bomb!\n\nCONS:\n- There's no nearby washrooms in this restaurant.  You have to walk through the adjoining casino just to wash your hands.\n- Their pies aren't very good.
4;This is the best mechanic I've ever been to. We've been going to them for years, but my experience with them yesterday made me want to post a review finally. I would have always given them 5 stars, but their service yesterday just reminded me of how exceptional they are. They will never try to sell you something you don't need, they will tell you how long you can wait for a repair so you don't spend your money too soon, and they are ridiculously thorough. I dropped my car off over the weekend for 3 issues, and on Monday I had received at least 4 phone calls throughout the day giving me an update on the status of my car. \n\nThey're the best, they're good, they're friendly, and they're honest. Don't go anywhere else.
2;Was very excited at first to try out a DIY Pasta restaurant, but there really isn't anything special to their pastas. Just so-so..\nAlthough their ingredients are quite fresh and choices are endless, you could make the same pasta with Ragu sauce at home for much less. Not too much worth the price unless you're really craving pasta you are in a rush.\nOn the other hand, really quick service and clean and open dining area.

1;Spa is tiny. Terrible.  You can hear someone urinate while in waiting room of locker area.  Sauna was 90 degree.  Massage rooms were located right off the main entrance of spa so you could hear all the ladies squawking while they were getting there nails done.  Neck rest broke while getting the massage...nobodies fault, didn't make for comfortable rest of massage though. \n\nAs for the hotel....service is slooowwww.  Rang the front desk and an average 15 rings before someone unapologetically picked up. One time 30 rings and another no one picked up.  The excuse was they were booked solid.  So!  Staff for it! Rooms were ok.  I'm a platinum Marriott member, I've been to a ton of hotels (travel for work) and many of them were Marriott resorts.  This one gets last place.  Even the house keeping was slow, we didn't get our room turned until 3pm.  Room service was good.  The only reason they received two stars from me,
1;Although the hotel itself is beautiful, the problem is they put too much attention to the look and not enough in the service, and there are of course hidden fees.\n\nWe were charged a resort fee on top of already paying for the hotel room. \nThe toilet pipe actually broke!!!! That was a HUGE con. We have been to many gorgeous hotels, and even less than 5 star hotels and never has something like that happened to us. \nHousekeeping skipped our room one day, and came much later when we called. \nWhen it finally came time to check out... we were unable to do it through the TV. So we called from our room to check out, only to be placed on hold for 10 minutes. Finally when the staff returns, they say not only can we not check out over the phone, but that, we are 10 minutes late in checking out and may have been charged for the next day!\n\nWhy were we not told to that checking out over the phone is not possible in the first place!!! \n\nSo we go downstairs to check out like everyone else, and of course there is a LONG line...mind you this is a random middle of the week Wednesday we checked out.\n\nIn the end there was no way we were going to let them charge us an extra day. \n\nAll in all...aria is all hype!
4;Excellent work -- completely satisfied with the job they did.
0;If I could leave zero stars, I would.  Came here with a large group of 40+ for a dinner that was arranged with the restaurant weeks in advance.  When we arrived, they were still clearly unprepared (one of the guys on staff seemed entirely put out that we were there).  Rather than taking everyone's drink orders, they served one table (4-6 people) at a time.  Took almost an hour for my table to get drinks, and after an hour and a half, my table left to go elsewhere to eat because they hadn't even TAKEN our food order yet.  \n\nConsidering this was a Tuesday night and the restaurant had few customers, you would think they would do a frigging jig about a large party coming in with a guaranteed dollar amount to be spent per head (due to the prix fixe menu that was put together for our group when the reservation was made).  Instead, we left hungry and irritated.
3;BevMo is like Toys-R-Us for adults.  The first time I walked in my jaw dropped and I was in awe.  Great, great, great prices.  We bought all of our alcohol for our wedding here - liquor, wine, champagne, kegs.  They gave us a 10% discount on all of our wine & champagne because we had gone over the case limit as well as a $10 off coupon.  You can earn bonus points if you sign up to get a BevMo card and we have already received a 5% off coupon.  After our wedding we were even allowed to return the liquor that had not yet been open. \n\nThey also have wine tasting on the weekend, but it is for a cost...I think $2.  The only downfall is it is in a warehouse style room and the wine tasting area is awkward and was not well thought out.  But it is never too crowded and you never have to wait in line long. \n\nThe best part is by far the killer prices.  \n\nCheers!
4;ZUMBA. Tony, Brandon & RyRy are the fantastic!  I recently moved back to Phoenix from San Diego and even though I have been doing Zumba for a few years, every class is different.  These guys are fun, energetic, motivating, have great play lists and easy to follow, even if you are new to Zumba. I love their classes!!
4;Chicken and Waffles to die for. The food takes a while to come out but it's cooked to order and well worth the wait.
0;Beware of bait an switch. This place deserves ZERO stars. Came on a Sunday. Ordered of the lunch menu that was given to us. After placing the order, the waitress told us there is no lunch special on Sunday, and the prices were triple. They wouldn't honor the lunch prices or apologize for the mistake. We left without eating. Asked to speak to a manager and there no manager on duty, which was a lie because I saw him there. The waitress was a total b***h!!!
1;So..I was really excited and looking forward to trying this place that started it all, home of the Original and first Hot and Juicy establishment here in Vegas. I arrived a little before dinner time and the place wasn't packed. Ok. I got it, it's because no one has come for dinner yet. So, I'm happy about not having to wait but Not so happy about the service and their crawfish that day. The service was slow and unfriendly and the crawfish was not fresh at all. It was small and very chewy. I know crawfish is not in season in February when i went but I thought they serve up fresh live crawfish year round. I didn't expect it to be less great (being the first one opening) than their place in Washington D.C where it never disappoint. Every chance I visit D.C, I always stop by to order or eat in. The flavor of their sauces there seems tastier, more flavorful, and crawfish fresher. If anyone has a chance to visit D.C and loves crawfish as much as I do, then stop by the Hot n Juicy there!
1;I ate here for lunch because they are on my eScrip rewards list.  I wasn't expecting a dark bar... I ordered some chili and it was OK.  It didn't compare to the chili I ate a week earlier at Gallagher's.  The waitress helped me lightly - I asked for some crackers that were not provided automatically.  \n\nI may come back here - if I'm in a dark bar mood at lunch.  If so, I'll order something other than the chili.
2;Excellent breakfast spot! Vast menu--almost too many choices--with plenty of vegetarian options. Large portions, and everyone's dish came with a healthy serving of fresh fruit. I had the veggie benedict. Good choice with the grilled tomatoes and fresh avocado, although my eggs were a bit overdone. The home fries are amazing though! Crispy and great seasoning. The bottomless coffee wasn't that great, but good enough for a bottomless pot to wake you up in the morning.\n\nService was incredible! Fast, attentive, friendly. I wish I could remember our waitress's name to give her a 5-star review. The service is definitely what would keep me coming back. The food is good, but the pricing was a bit high (I think bennie + coffee came to $14 + tip) to make it a regular go-to breakfast.
1;Close-to-school joint that has $2 beers.. oh, wait... they don't do this anymore.  Pretty much the only reason (other than the half-off appetizers) we came here after assessments for and now there isn't really a reason to come.  They have bowling lanes that are fully functional but cosmic bowling down the street at Sunset Station has a higher appeal in my eyes so I probably wouldn't casually stroll in here to bowl or give it a first recommendation to anyone.  Plus, you come out smelling like an ashtray.  The only reason I would come back is if I was too lazy to drive to egg works for an omelet and I would rather settle on the ones here.  Other than that, you probably wouldn't see much of me at Wildfire.
4;Thank you Shirlene and Rosemary for your exceptional service. They both went above and beyond to make me feel at home en route to my next destination! Food and beer were great! Don't forget to try the Arizona Gunslinger hot sauce. It was like nothing I had ever had before.\n\n\nMichael Scott
2;"Lots of waiters running around enthusiastically asking us how they could help, but they never replenished my ice tea, or coffee; steak was overcooked and dry, very very expensive, did not tell us about $29 special on Sunday night for prime rib and it was not on menu!  There was a little piece of paper on table about prime rib special which we saw after we had ordered.  Why was it not mentioned?"
1;The food for the most part is the same but the portions are getting smaller (a kids fruit cup had 2 pieces of fruit) and prices seem to be going up...
0;The worst restaurant in Tempe hands down. I've been there several times and received the same poor service with the same sloppy food. \n\nReally it's a shame since it's a great location, but I can't wait to see what takes this place's spot.\n\nhttp://grtaylor2.com/2011/09/16/worst-restaurant-in-tempe-deverti-bar-gril/
2;A bit pricey for what you get. I think the draw here is the atmosphere and the interior deco. The food is decent though, and I've always had decent service here... busy or not. I'd say the food is on par with Ra, but is a tad more expensive. \n\nTo be honest, I'd rather eat at Ra - but sometimes it's overrun with teenage high school girls wearing too much makeup pretending to be socialites or else you can't get service at all. If I'm going to a special Sushi place, I'll go somewhere else... but in a pinch, I'll hit this place up.\n\nNice staff, cool atmosphere, decent food.
3;We were completely blown away by the show. Went there with my wife and parents and was worried they may not like it. But everyone had such a good time. Fantastic show.
0;I wish I can put this with no stars, most of the food was disgusting, not only this, the lady on the cashier was so rude, the only good thing was the server she was smiling all the time and came to our table several time to check if we need anything, I paid $82 for two persons but honestly, i shouldn't paid $5 for this
0;On Thursday, 5/8/14, I ordered chicken nuggets, fries, and mini-churros from this Jack In the Box. I got the worst food poisoning. I had to go to the ER, and that is the first time I have been there in 20 years. \n\nI would stay away from this restaurant.
0;From the outside it seems nice and the location is convienent if you live downtown. But in all honesty this is the worst library in Phoenix.  Littered with homeless and all of the employees are very rude!!
1;: Long line, ticket to get in is only $20..pricey drinks, rave not a big fun, walked in and had a couple of drinks walked out of the club disappointed :(
3;I have to say this place makes some delish food. I ordered takeout, and it was a good thing too. The few tables they had in the dining room were all taken. \n\nI had the pork pad see ew and the Thai fried rice. I was a little disappointed that the pad see ew had regular broccoli instead of Chinese broccoli, but the taste made up for it. The Thai fried rice was out of this world. Hands down the best fried rice I've eaten in Vegas. It had lots of basil and was spiced perfectly. The portions were also quite generous, even though they were lunch specials. \n\nI will order from this place again for sure. They are less expensive than some of the close by Thai restaurants, but equally as good if not better..
3;Mekong has more things than Lee Lee's and they give 10% off on your total order, which I love.  Lee Lee's used to do this.  However, I saw the owner of Lee Lee's work hard all these years and start from a small store on Dobson & Southern.  So, my heart is always towards the small business.\n\nMekong has a large variety of things and the store is packed.  It's a bit overwhelming to go there, so you need to know what you're looking for.  I wish this store were closer to me, but I'm glad that there are several options for me for an Asian supermarket - Mekong and Lee Lee's.  \n\nIt's clean and I can't say that the Asian staff is friendly (at least not to me being an Asian), but I found when I ask a non-Asian staff member, they are much more helpful and friendly.  \n\nHowever, I don't expect that I go to an Asian Supermarket for the staff to be friendly, like you would at a Caucasian based supermarket.  Probably some sort of double standard I put up with, but c' lest vie.  \n\nWe don't visit this area of the valley often, but when we do, I try to pick up a few items that Lee Lee's might not have or might be better priced here.
3;No room, don't buy passes on street. They are fake. The club was very small. But it was cool. You had people bumping into you constantly but what do you expect it's Vegas. I was a little upset the security guy didn't let me keep the picture I took of the model. But other than that it was ok.
4;I LOVE Ted Baker.  I usually shop the Santana Row location where I always experience spectacular service (they offer me beverages and on my very first visit gave me ted baker condoms and a mini slinky which was funny because I had no idea what they had given me until I got home). \n\nTed Baker Vegas, located in the new section of the Caesar's Forum Shops,  was having a sale.  I wanted to buy everything.  I love the clothes, I love the way they fit and LOVE the way they wear.  They could easily bankrupt me.  I've even got my husband warming up to their men's clothes.\n\nEvery single person working in this store was fun, friendly and easy to talk to and extremely helpful (I think there were 4 of them there when we went in).  Talk about an amazing shopping experience.\n\nAbout the sizing - they use a 1-4 scale (some items use the standard XS-L sizing) for sizing which takes some getting used to, but can definitely be a stroke to the ego when you want to look at a smaller number on your size tag.
0;My previous review was written 3 years ago.  I've been back MANY times since, but my friends and I tried to go there tonight (2/15/12) and it was closed and there was a red warning sign on the front door from the Henderson Constable's Office.  Everything inside looked the same, so I hope whatever legal issues will be resolved, but I'm not holding my breath.  It would suck because I have a $40 gift certificate which, if not redeemable at the Sushi Factory West location, might be worthless.\n\nThe quality of the food has never seemed to go down these past couple of years, but the place was NEVER really busy, even during peak times.  There's approximately 10 sushi places up and down Eastern between Anthem and the 215, so I'm guessing this place might have succumbed to the glut of competition in the area.  Let's hope not!
0;I have been a regular at China Chili for over 10 years. Sadly once they moved to the new location on 3rd Street and Flower their quality has been deteriorating.  \n\nWent recently for lunch and ordered the Mongolian Beef and Beef Foo Young and both were awful, no taste, no flavor and very sub standard.  The prices have gone up the quality is shameful.\n\nI think that the Orange Chicken is possibly their best item right now but sadly did not have it.  Thought I would explore to other dishes but never again.\n\nNot sure I will be back, possibly for lunch for the Orange Chicken. With so many other choices of Asian Food.. this local favorite has not kept up its quality.
0;My husband and I were around the area and couldn't decide where to eat .I was in the mood for some variety and also wanted some crab legs so we stopped in. The cost was $11.99 per person which was a bit higher than other buffets in the few mile radius. But I was hoping it was because they were gonna have a great selection. We arrived at 7:30 pm and the dining room was about a third full. All the food trays were not full (not even half full) and the food looked like they had been sitting there for a while. I was just still looking forward to my crab legs though. Well the crab tray was never full and when it was replenished, they only brought out about a pound at a time. Let me tell you I wasn't the only person eyeing the new trays brought out,but I was the farthest from the buffet table. So I didn't get as much as wanted..just a couple legs. The majority went to a table of 4 big young men who had the eyes of a hawk and speed as fast as lightening. Oh well..So I told my husband he could pick the next place for us to eat at, even if it is fast food ...which I despise. We won't be going back here but I still wasn't able to leave China City Super Buffet behind after I left. My stomache started hurting on the drive home...
2;meh it's ok, it's pricey for what you get! was cool to try but I'm not in a hurry to eat there again
3;Found this place through yelp. Lives up to the great reviews. Friendly with good food! I'll be coming back a lot.
1;About 6 years ago, I tried this restaurant and was impressed with the food quality and affordable prices. Back then, you could order a rib eye , or filet  mignon for about $10-$15 cheaper than you could on the strip.\n\n Like many hardworking people here in Las Vegas, the economy has forced me to order # 1's at McDonald's now instead of eating at high-end steak houses. \n\nI was so happy when I saw this place advertising a prime rib dinner special for $12.99.  After calling to confirm the special price,  we made reservations and even got dressed up for the occasion. \n\nWe ordered 3 prime rib specials ( 2 medium, and 1 medium well). They all came out underdone and almost cold in the center. Are you kidding me? Medium and medium well to me is not blood rare (almost blue). My wife sent hers back, while I chose to eat around the outside of my prime rib. \n\nHowever, not everything was disgusting as the prime rib specials. The chopped salad was a nice appetizer with a perfect blend of cheese, bacon, and dressing. The best side dish was the sonoma potatoes which were fried and sauteed with onions. \n\nTo their credit, they ended up not charging us for 2 of the prime rib dinners. Good thing they did, or this would have been a 1 star rating. \n\nI am so disappointed! Oh well, back to McDonald's.
4;Hands down the best meal and service I quite possibly have ever had! Pork belly appetizer, scallop entree, and braised beef entree were something I'll be dreaming about for a while..! If you're looking for a great place to eat and are willing to spend the money I promise it will be worth it. You MUST request Owen for your server... He is very knowlegable about the menu which helps in deciding what to get. Not to mention he could be the best all around server we ever had! We will absolutely eat here again when in the area!
1;I mean, everything that you can read below is true.  Lots of the cardio machines are broken or performing badly, the staff sits at their desks in the corner and watches everyone (in a strange way) and the layout/carpet/design are outdated.
3;Had the sliced beef brisket combo.  Sandwich was really good!! Look forward to returning soon.
0;I ate here 2 nights ago and it was the worst food I have had in as long as I can remember. I had the recommended Macaroni and cheese with a Harley twist and it's was disgusting. Mediocre service and mildly interesting atmosphere. There are much better options on the strip.
4;Amazing HH. Blacken Miso Cod is to die for!!  Bar is FUN ...clever bartenders perform death defying drink pours! HH all day everyday in the summer. (gotta beat those triple digit temps somehow) its insanely PACKED on Fridays starting around 5.  They also have valet so don't fret about the full parking lot.
1;The pizza sauce needs a good improvement, sauce to spicy. The subs are ok.
3;"After visiting this store and a couple other locations, I can officially say I'm a Sur La Table girl rather than Williams Sonoma. Sur La Table has a much better selection and better service. If anything, SLT people tend to be overly eager to help, but I'll take that over being ignored at Williams Sonoma.\n\nDuring my last trip to SLT, I needed an apple corer so my husband could make some culinary abomination called a \""potato bomb.\"" The salesgirl showed me no less than 5 versions and helped me select the best one for our needs. \n\nI also got a mini loaf pan (their brand) that is now my favorite piece of bakeware. The pan is nice and heavy and coated in silicon so you don't have to use any butter or spray. The coating makes it very easy to wash too.\n\nAnother reason I prefer SLT is because they carry scharffen berger chocolate. It's the best stuff, and you can't tell me otherwise. I can't see myself buying other food items there however. Their cake decorations were ridiculously over priced, as in $15 for sprinkles.\n\nWhat really draws me in at SLT is the clearance sections throughout the store. I picked up a 4qt Staub in a SLT-exclusive green color for $50 off. I'm a sucker for a good bargain, and that one made me giddy."
0;this place is horrible. Terrible food and their service is even worse.
4;Excellent food.  Great value.  We went here multiple times because I wanted to try all the yummy dishes.
3;I love this place! It's a little hole-in-the-wall in Oakland. It's a very homely place. The owners are very friendly and talkative. The food is great. It's not too oily and creamy. The food has simple distinct flavors that are hard to find in other restaurants. It doesn't feel like heavy restaurant food, but more like home made food. The vegetables are fresh. I've even had their sushi and liked it. I've tried almost all of their entrees and have enjoyed all of them. It's a simple little homely place.
1;"Let me start off by saying I've been to this Quiznos over 20 times, and that's a conservative estimate.  Last year they had probably a 25% failure to make the right sandwich rate.  But they have Improved this year to about 10% though.  It can be a good place to eat if you follow a couple guidelines.  First off,  never tell them what you don't want on sandwich.  Even though the ingredients are clearly listed behind them they will look at you like your speaking another language.  Tell them \"" I want an x with just the y and z\"".   Next,  don't tell them what veggies you want before theyve cooked it.  They will forget it or look at you weird.  It's kind of a hassle because you have to keep track of your sub through the cooking process but that's just the way they do it.  Follow those rules if you wanna have a good meal.\n\nAlso if the manager is reading this yelp review like any good manager should then Know this:  every single time anyone orders a sub at your quiznos they are asked if they want it for here to go twice? Is the first one just for fun?  That's a lack of communication that reflects poorly on every single customer that comes through."
1;JET was really  whatevers.  They seem to let anyone in.  The music was alright.  The only reason we went was to get free drinks during open bar.  The club is really crowded because it is small.\n\nMost of the people there did not seem classy.  Two girls were wearing Nike slip ons while clubbing. WHO DOES THAT???\n\nThere was also an old couple at the club. I say they were maybe around 50 years in age...scary! They should be at a lounge or a restaurant, not at a club! \n\nI would not go back to this club, unless there is a special event.
4;It was up to me to secure a limo for a Halloween party for four of us. Procrastinating put me on the day of the party.  I called and was immediately helped by a professional representative from the limo company. After securing a roundtrip to the party I received email confirmations along with another email with the limo drivers cell numbers. Upon pick up Diane the first driver called and was early to assure she could find my home which is located in a very dark country club with many homes. She was friendly,early and arrived with Roses for the ladies and champagne.  Our pick up was scheduled with Luis who again was early and had no problem waiting while we said our goodbyes at the party. It was a great experience and both drivers were accommodating and friendly. I would recommend this company to everyone.
1;I have been a long term customer at The Bruce Company. I always had a more than positive experience. However, the Customer Service I received this past Spring was inexcusable. I did receive a call from the General Manager after I complained, and I  did except his apology.  However, the experience was very negative and I will no longer shop there.
0;Didn't even get a chance to try their cookies or ice cream because of the horrendous smell that permeated throughout the store.  My friend and I ate lunch at Crave across the street and decided to stop by Cookiez to get dessert.  As soon as we opened the door the smell slapped us in the face.  I felt we had entered a bathroom which hadn't been cleaned in months.  My friend said it smelled like an old gym locker room.  Needless to say we left without ordering.
3;Breakfast is GREAT!!!  Pancakes and French Toast AMAZING !! Service is GREAT.. Im going up in a week
0;I have been to Vegas a number of times and my review is based on my typical experience... I've stayed at PH before and my experience then was terrific. That was about four years ago. This time however... Was gross. \n\nFirst, we got to our room and noticed a faint smell. We unpacked and as we did so, I stepped in a wet spot on the floor. I quickly put my shoes back on and decided that not even socks were OK in this room. After we opened the bathroom doors, the smell got stronger... And, then even stronger a few hours later. \n\nLater that evening. I sat on the edge of the bed, and the mattress fell through the frame. Looking around, I noticed that the furniture was pretty beat up as well. \n\nWe were only there two nights and it was on the second night that we decided to turn on the TV... Nope it didn't work. \n\nBTW-Did I mention, this was an upgraded room? I think not. It was pretty small, and by no means anything like any upgraded room I've stayed in before. \n\nFood... Well, we opted to eat out most of the time, but on our second night we decided to try Burgr... My burger was salty and chared. The soda was flat and they had no means of replacing it with something drinkable. \n\nStay at PH at your own risk.
4;If your young and live in the Ballantyne/Pineville area this is a great spot! I reccomend Sunday Funday (a collaboration of karaoke/beer pong/pool/darts and great drink specials).  The staff is why I come back! (Jillian/Melissa/Lindsay/ Colleen and many more) The staff is friendly and personable.  It's honestly the Cheers bar of Charlotte. Super laid back and safe!
3;I've eaten here a bunch of times since discovering it back when i moved into the Rhodes Ranch area in 2006. Coming from the North East, you don't get many places with good southwest flavor like this.\n\nHave had numerous things from here. Chicken tacos are bomb, little greasy but damn tasty. California burrito is good, way better than those I have had at Roberto's. My wife digs the carne asada taco's, I'll agree with some other reviewers though, not very big on seasoning flavor here, but it is quality meat and the salsa, cilantro and guac makes them go down easy.\n\nAll in all, this place is cheap eats, done proper. And oh yeah open 24/7. Can't be beat really.
0;"Bottom Line:  There are many other centrally located hotels and rental apartments in Edinburgh, so I do NOT recommend risking Apex City Hotel's billing practices.\n \nPROs:  The Apex City Hotel is located between all the top tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, and clubs.  We loved the free internet and free computers.  The rooms were nicely sized and well kept.  The furniture was a little dated and worn.  The reception staff were very nice, professional, and accommodating.  \n \nCONs:  The reservation staff are ruthless.  We booked our 2 night stay prior to starting our trip and turned down their offer to book a third night at half price.  During our trip, we decided to stop at Edinburgh a night sooner.  Apex City Hotel referred us to their offsite reservation staff to the book the extra night.  (Weird that they can't do it at the hotel, but ok.)  We called and were disappointed that the reservation staff would no longer offer us the third night at half price.  Moreover, we found out AFTER we got home that they treated our addition of an extra night as a modification to our reservation and charged us $64!!  We never authorized this charge.  I learned of it for the first time when reviewing my credit card statement.  \n \nAfter several emails with their reservation staff, they are standing behind their charge.  I couldn't believe it!  We paid $455.96 for three nights at their hotel (NOT including the $64 charge)....in the OFF SEASON.  I can't imagine what they charge during peak season.  And I really can't imagine why they felt entitled to charging us for \""modifying\"" our reservation by adding a night. We didn't get the rescinding of the third night at half off deal....but found the \""modification\"" fee for wanting to stay a third night absolutely ridiculous.  I had to contest the charge with VISA."
4;Love, love, love Pita Jungle. The food is absolutely delicious!!\n\nFor as many times as I've enjoyed their food, I've never actually dined in the restaurant (we always get takeout) - but judging by the crowds I always see - it is a popular spot for sure!\n\n I have ordered several things off of their menu and loved it - I usually get the Greek Chicken salad - they give you TONS of chicken and it's so delicious!
4;Excellent!!!  Best sub I've ever had. My son-in-law turned me on to this place one Sunday after working all morning building a fence.\n\nI had the best Philly Cheese Steak ever (although I've never been to Philly). I'm pretty sure it's the best you could find in Charlotte. Come to think of it, I have never seen a Philly Cheese Steak on other sub shop menus - And granted, I was starving that Sunday afternoon, and would have probably eaten a bologna sandwich on white bread. So, just to be sure, I've been back a few times since and every time enjoyed the subs.\n\nIf you've never been there, give it a try. You'll love it. They make the subs to order, hot or cold, a large selection of meats, cheeses and toppings, unlike other sub shops.  And the price is right.\n\nJust writing this review is making me hungry. See you at Penn Station.
3;Had a really good experience at Buddy V's.  Nice Italian food and truly HUGE portions.  On a Wednesday night, it was kind of like family night with a lot of kids in the room.  Speaking of kids, the kid menu portion were also huge.  As it turns out, 3 of us could have easily gotten a way with a single entree.  These were heavily cheesy meals with pasta to perfection.  \n\nWhat keeps the place from being a 5 is that the actual quality wasn't that special but it's a definitely above average offering and experience
0;I love their food. But I won't go inside due to the poor cleanliness and bugs. So I opt for the drive thru and usually that works. But tonight was terrible. We pulled up and asked for a minute and then were asked a few seconds later if we were ready. Then a lady came onto the speaker and was so rude. So we decided real quick and she kept interrupting and getting the order wrong. When we finally got the order correct  we paid and they told us it would be 4 minutes. That was fine at least the food was ping to be fresh. They brought us our order and forgot our extra biscuits. When we went to go ask for them the same rude women handed them to us in a napkin. Although I love the food. I will not be returning to this location.
2;"They did a great job remodeling that old building. The restaurant is built around a rectangular bar with comfy looking booths along the outer wall, and some tables up front. Behind the building is kind of like an open corridor space - across from which is a patio structure. They have a well-stocked full bar with 7 or 8 wines on \""tap\"" and a whole bunch of craft beers. The menu is comprised of a few appetizers, salads and sandwiches, everything priced below $12 or so. Unfortunately for me I try to avoid carbs which means ordering a salad for dinner, not something I do often. I settled for the halibut sandwich - and took off the bun. The fish, fancy mayo and veggies were a perfect blend, fish was cooked perfectly...\n\nBOTTOM LINE: I'll probably make a habit of drinking here and dining elsewhere"
0;I have read the reviews and am in agreement with most of them.  I have been having knee pain for a couple of years.  Dr. Yee was recommended by my primary care doctor.   I was put in a room by Joy (very friendly).  Xrays were taken.  Dr. Yee walks in and said I needed a knee replacement.  He did NOT examine my knee.  He said I could have an injection and then walked out.  His physician assistant Brittany walked in.  She looked at my knee but did not do any range of motion, did not ask me to walk.  No type of exam.  She said it was swollen.  The assistant then moved me into another room for the injection.  Brittany then placed the ultrasound wand on my knee without any conducting gel, then took off the wand and injected my knee.  I told her that I have stage 3 chronic kidney disease but she still gave me a prescription for voltarin gel (no nsaids like motrin should be given for people with chronic kidney disease).  She told me to come back in 4-6 weeks for another injection.  I said to her-i thought I needed a knee replacement and she said we will see when you come back in.\n\nI am a nurse.  Have been for 25 years.  I have never been to a visit like this.  I got no explanation as to what type of knee replacement was to be done, what type of artificial joint was gonna be used, etc.  Worst of all, I got charged for an ultrasound for $379, office visit of $316, an echo guide for needle injection $376, large joint injection $220, an xray $89 and injected medication $35.  All total I spent $1418 for a 6-7 minute visit.  I called my insurance company and told them not to pay for part of the visit.  I would pay fo the medication and the xray because i  did have those.  My insurance company is currently investigating. \n\nI am sure Dr. Yee is an excellent, qualified surgeon but the office visit was terrible.   I truly felt like I was just another number.  I am currently looking for another doctor.  SOMEONE who TALKS to their patients.  And for the amount of money that was spent, I would have expected the doctor to at least explain something to me.\n\nI feel lucky because I have a medical background.  I feel very sorry for a person that goes for a visit because you will not get an explanation as to what your problem is.\n\nThe crazy part - I got a copy of the visit and it was 2 pages long.  This is a lie because of the above stuff I mentioned above.  They must have copied info from someone else because it certainly was not my exam - because I never got one.
3;"Wonderful experience, great service and exceptional food.  Only reason I did not give 5 stars is it is geared towards tourists, like everything is in Vegas. We went for a special dinner, to celebrate a special event... it just lacked the \""wow\"" and \""over the top\"" I was hoping for"
0;This is for the produce only. I had gone here before about 3 months ago. The produce then was rotten and had bugs flying around it. I ventured to give it a try again to see if there were any improvements. I sadly did not find an improvement in the produce section. They are still rotten and badly bruised.
3;First time in Charlotte, first stop in this store, \nNice food and service! Will come again
1;"I had their chicken BBQ and it's was ok not the best in the world I could have made some at home that would have tasted better. In fact I have made some that tastes way better but I was in a rush and wanted food. And the guy at the counter was beyond rude to me when I ordered. Also the guy who gave me my food got all pissed of when he brought me my food because it was a to go order. God forbid he put my food in a paper bag. Even if the food is shitty most places still have great customer service this place unfortunately had neither. Sad thing is is that I work in the same business complex as them. I will no longer be going there for lunch. Someone else can use my \""discounts\"" which btw way i did not receive like i was suppose to. At least I enjoyed the french fries."
4;Nothing extraordinary about the taste. Simple delicious classic food. Loved the sweet chili sauce though. However, the service was impeccable. They're friendly, fast and show equal concern towards every customer. It was a complete wonderful experience.
2;I stopped in Madison during my cross-country voyage (http://KananAcrossAmerica.blogspot.com) and I was just craving a brat, a friend with experience recommended this place.\n\nWell I absolutely dig the college atmosphere and I bet this place would be a great place to watch the game on Saturdays.  The brats were decent, but nothing to write home about.  I'm also not a fan of having to get your own fixings, I just feel sauerkraut should be already included, but that's just personal preference.\n\nGreat place to hang out, overall good.
3;First cold soba noodles experience- and it was good!\n\nI ordered the Ten Zaru\nIt came with cold soba noodles with some seaweed. You dipped it into this sauce (high concentrated broth) and it was delicious! The texture was similar to al dente of pasta. The broth was savory! You can add wasabi/green onions to your sauce.\n\nWith that order, it came with soy sauce seasoned rice, which was okay to me.. Not a fan of the rice. But the shrimp and vegetable tempura were really good! Probably one of the best tempuras I've ever had. It was so fresh, the batter wasn't overdone or floury. Also, it came with a side of curry flavored salt and green tea flavored salt for your tempura.. that was a first, I really liked it!\n\nThe meal was really good. I was able to eat it all and be satisfied... so for people with larger appetites, like men, you might have to order more!\n\nThe location is in Chinatown in this older plaza. All the workers have really great mannerism and was very attentive to us. I definitely recommend it!
3;"One of the best train stations I have ever been to. From the moment you step off the train, you feel welcomed by the Montreal workers. You then take an escalator up to the main level, and you are welcomed by a little old man with a french accent who says \""welcome to Montreal\"". It really made our day, after spending 10 hours on a train.\n\nThe station is a major hub not only to mass transit, but to other parts of Montreal's amazing underground city. Directly upstairs is the Fairmont Queens Elizabeth Hotel. I stayed at that hotel, so all I had to do was take an escalator upstairs from the train station and I was in the hotel's lobby."
2;I have to chime in on the cost factor and the amount of laps. $30 is steep to pay when you consider that your not burning fuel, they cut you short of the full 11 laps promised if someone bumps a wall and they stop the race.  I think I managed 5 or 6 laps at best before they ended the race.\n\nNow if it had been $30 and you can race for a few hours then it wouldnt be a bad deal. \n\nCost to fun ratio not so good as these are tough economic times and there are other tracks in town where you get more bang for the buck.\n\nYes the Karts are fast, and just about the time your getting in sync with the car and track conditions and braking and turning points its over.
0;STAY AWAY, spend your money else where. This place wrote the book on bad costumer service. Went there with the family and kids, and they had $10 cover, even for the kids, for a pay per view event. You could get food credit, so there were really trying to make sure you spent $10 per person. But the boneheaded manager would only accept cash to get in, and if you didn't have cash, you could use their ATM and pay a fee. They wouldn't accept a credit card, or even think of any alternative. So we didn't go in. So good luck in this economy, Mr. Buffalo Wild Wings owners, making do, with a crappy customer service approach and boneheaded manager. So we went to Elephant Bar instead and had a great meal.
4;Cafe Zojo is always a nice treat. Great staff, nice atmosphere and awesome coffee. One of my favorites.
2;I wasn't planning on watching this show but wanted to watch something close to our hotel since we had an early flight the next day.  I was able to get tickets at Tix4Tonight for about $80 each including all fees and had decent seats. \n\nThe show was scheduled to start at 7:30 but didn't start until 7:40.  Even then we were shown a video of all the times David Copperfield's name was mentioned in movies and tv shows.  He does try to get the audience involved in his tricks which made my bf wish we had closer seats so he would be chosen. During the trick where he was supposed to go through the fan, we sat at the table that is right behind the box Copperfield stands on when he reappears and my bf got to shake his hand, which was probably our coolest moment out of the entire show.  I do agree that some portions sound very scripted (i.e. the part where he talks about his grandfather, it sounded like he was speed reading) but there were a few wow moments. \n\nI probably won't see the show again, once is enough, but it was my first magic show in vegas so it seemed alright to me.
1;We just stopped by here to grab a few drinks and gamble a little. SLS grabbed our attention with the modern and upscale vibe so we thought it would be busy and upbeat, however, business was slow and the bars were close to empty. I took this as an opportunity to get an empty roulette table. I immediately had a bad experience with the dealer. He thought he was being a funny guy but his comments were brash from the moment I sat down. Was he trying to be sarcastic-funny or insulting? I wasn't sure what to make of it but I was sure that he hated his life. I quickly cashed out and got out of there. It's unfortunate that their service is so poor when this place looks like it would be white glove. There's a Fred Segel shop in here and a few restaurants that look trendy but I wont be giving them a chance. From other reviews and my own experience, the poor service is destroying their potential and they really need to work on turning it around.
1;Was craving a torta Tuesday night 7/3, and I knew that my fave was already closed by 830pm (Tortas El Guero). Also had my g/f that night, who'd never had one. She ordered the Paquime, and I had the Cubano w/o beans. I was highly disappointed. Those two sandwhiches are nowhere approaching the same league as my fave, or Tortas Del Rey. Tiny, thin, and so-so on the taste. \n\nMy g/f loved hers, and kept wondering why I was disappointed. On July 4th, I called and found T El G was open, and I promptly took her there. Then, and only then, with close comparison, could she understand the vast chasm of difference between a true TORTA, and those two jokers we had the night before. \n\nNOW, I want to be clear I'm only disappointd in their sandwhiches. The place is large, clean, friendly and OPEN late. I saw a salad and a plate dish or two coming out of that kitchen for which I WILL RETURN to sample.It's just that when I want a REAL -DEAL TORTA, it won't be there.
1;"After spending several hours on-line scoping out sushi spots to celebrate my son's graduation after 9pm on a Tuesday. I picked this spot because it was open late (til 2am), had good reviews and sounded \""family friendly\"". I was a bit disappointed.  \n\nThe food was just so-so. I've had better sushi. It was fresh enough but completely unremarkable. There was lots of differently named rolls. But, we ordered two of the spiciest rolls on the menu (marked by 4 & 5 chili icons) and had to add extra wasabi & ginger just to get a little heat. We even asked the server (who never told us her name) to kick up the heat on the 2nd round - still only worth 2 chillies. The drinks were kinda tasty thought; we got Shiso Mojitos in very small champagne glasses for 3 and half bucks. So that was cool.\n\nThe service was sllllllllow. The server was nice enough (although she made some comment like monkey-see-monkey-do that really rubbed my brother the wrong way). We ordered several rolls the 1st round (about 8). They came out about two at a time with about 10 mins. between each set. So we remained hungry the entire night. Maybe this was the plan for us to order more rolls. But with 7 adults at the table, we'd each have a piece of roll and have to wait for more food to come out. It was frustrating.\n\nThe seating was just horrible. We reserved for a party of ten. The whole restaurant seemed as if it would only seat 50. In order to get food into the main dining area, the server has to pass in front of the restaurant's entry door. This \""restaurant\"" is more of a cafe'. If everyone that we wanted to share in this occasion came with us, the restaurant would not have held everyone. If they have a party of more than ten, I am pretty sure they'd have to close the restaurant to other guests.\n\nThe best part of the evening was the end. My son got a free ice-cream desert for being the graduate. The gratuity was not added in, so we could appropriate an adequate tip-to-service ratio. And the bill for the whole affair was still under $200.\n\nSo if you want an inexpensive sushi meal, this is a good place for it. But I wouldn't go out of my way and make plans to go here. It's a good drop-in-on-the-way-to spot but nothing spectacular."
0;Do not try to place an order from an iPhone because they will not deliver your pizza unless you babysit your phone and answer when they call to confirm. If you miss the call you're fucked and left hungry.
3;"Hanging in South Side? Late night hunger? this is THE SPOT\n\nThey even bring out a bbq cart around midnight on the sidewalk\n\nyeah ordering inside takes a while and food is a bit slow, but it's worth it. one Chicken Kabob on Whole Wheat pita for $4 seems expensive, until you get the portion - HUGE and tasty.\n\n-1 star because once I read fresh garden rolls I had to have. But they were\""short staffed\"". Too bad they wouldn't take up my offer to make a few myself. I make a good roll.\n\nNever know who you'll meet here, everyone is friendly, met 4 guys in from Ireland, awesome night. But that's another story ;p"
0;If I could give zero stars, I would.  The worst flight experience ever.  First, I didn't arrive to the gate until 15 minutes before take off due to a problem at the security line that took us over an hour, however once I got to the gate they had already given my seats away!!!! The next flight was 3 hours later so I had to wait around (not to mention my original flight took off 5 mins early, so they gave my seats away way before the time they were suppose to).  Once I finally boarded the next flight, the seats had NO cushioning, hard as rocks, AND they were so cramped.  I'm lucky I'm not overweight otherwise I wouldn't have fit!  I'm also not that tall, yet I couldn't even stand up straight.  I was on a 2.5 hour flight and guess what, no snacks!  What airline doesn't at least serve pretzels or peanuts???  I get pretzels, peanuts, and a drink when flying other airlines for only 55 minutes!  Needless to say, I was highly disappointed in my experience and will NEVER fly US Airways again.
4;Great place! Impressive number and variety of games,  friendly and helpful staff. Loved it!
3;we had a great time celebrating birthdays with family!\nJeff (the manager) was awesome!!!
1;"Mandalay Bay where do I start with you.  I enjoyed your lavish rooms and flawless amenities.  The dice tables were extra nice to me, but the blackjack, slots and every other game you can think of were extra mean!\n\nI want to give this hotel a good ranking.... I just can't.  The pool situation was like some sick combination of 1930's Ellis Island and the Japanese Internment camps.  \n\nLets start out with a little background.  Went to Vegas for my sisters 21st birthday.  My extended family and friends always join in on a trip to Vegas.  Probably had about 30-35 people there for the festivities.  The majority of these people are a bit older and cant handle being out in the heat all day.  They needed a cabana.  \n\nMy pops and I tired to reserve a cabana when we checked in (mind you we had 5 rooms reserved under the same name, you would think they could hook us up).  No dice; can't reserve a cabana, you need to go wait in line to get one tomorrow morning.  \n\nMy dad woke up at the ass crack of dawn to grab a cabana; he was the first in line.  After 100+ people lined up for a cabana a man walked out of the reservation office and said. \""We have 2-3 cabanas left to purchase; they start at $450, then $650 and $750.  Chairs can be reserved for $75 and the umbrellas are $50\"".  I couldn't believe my ears! Where do they get off making people wait in line spend almost a g-note on a cabana only to spend $100s on drinks and food!  The casinos must be hurting because they are trying to make all their cash at the pool! \n\nMandalay Bay where do you get off!"
4;I have been coming to Smile Design Center for just over 6 years... these guys are amazing. Dr. James and Ashley are awesome and super friendly. The other staff is always nice and friendly. I will continue to come here as long as I live in Vegas.
1;"I actually had received an email from Yelp yesterday with Phat Phrank's highlighted in it and so thought I would try it out for the first time since the ratings were so good.\n\nSomewhat disappointed.....I don't think it is a 4.5 star rating, but if I was in the neighborhood and was hungry for Mexican Food I would stop. Certainly not worth a trip of about 6 miles from my home.\n\nI ordered a chicken burrito.  Thought I would compare it to the chicken burrito I had the previous day at \""Roberto's Tacos.\""\n\nIt was good, but not fabulous.  I had asked if they put cheese on their chicken burritos and I was told yes, but after eating the whole thing, I hadn't seen a sign of any cheese.  They do add rice and beans, which to me then makes it a combination burrito and I wanted chicken.  The chicken was all white meat, but not enough chicken for me and to much rice and beans.  It was bland tasting without adding any salsa or hot sauce.  The portion size was good, and the salsa was good, but would have tasted better on chips rather than the burrito.\n\nThe chicken burrito I had eaten at the \""Roberto's\"" the day before was all chicken, no rice and beans and very tasty.  It was seasoned with some chiles and peppers and very good to eat without adding anything to it if you didn't want to.  Roberto's was definitely better when it came to the chicken burrito.\n\nPhat Phrank's does not have a menu board and so you have to wait until you get up to the counter to look at the one menu they had available to order off of.  It didn't give you much time to make up your mind when there were people waiting in line behind you.\n\nThe employees were all very friendly and the facility was clean.\n\nI will probably go back and try some other items, but not at the top of my list to run right back tomorrow."
4;The Black n White cookies are to die for. That's all I get when I go to Karsh's but no other place in AZ makes them except for Chompie's and there's aren't very good. I visit twice a month to grab a handful of cookies for my family & I.\n\nKARSH'S!!
3;Like this mall I go in there speaking english & come out speaking spanish they have everything from good food to Dillards....This is the hood & you can find anything in here
2;Went here on a Saturday night. It was about a 30 minute wait for 4 adults and 2 small children which is fine. Service was great and food was good. I had a drink (not beer) that was excellent. My only complaint is that it was SO LOUD in there! Like had to yell to be heard by the person sitting directly next to you loud. It must be the way it's arranged or the building materials or something....I couldn't imagine going here on a date or anytime you want to have a meaningful conversation.
2;The restaurant is still a fun destination for family events, birthdays, etc.   The food is pricey (about $25 a person) not including drinks,  but the portions are reasonably large.  Overall the  food on its own is a little bland tasting, but sauces are provided to experiment with.
2;I picked up a few sweets for clients, and while the food looked good, the service was awful. When I went to pick up the order, they didn't even have paper plates, and I had to get my own napkins and forks. \n\nI thought this was a catered order since the woman taking the order (who was very rough around the edges by the way) made me pay in advance. Due to it's proximity, I tried ordering the next day, and the woman answering the phone was so rude, and told me I would have to call another location to place a phone order, even though I had just ordered from there yesterday! \n\nThis is too bad because my coworkers and I usually refer good bakeries etc., to each other across the country, but I will never refer this place.
4;We found this furniture store after moving in the area and reading some other reviews. Jeff was very friendly from the moment we walked in and gave a number of catalogs to browse through as we tried to decide on two new bedroom sets. There were many options at reasonable prices. The furniture came in earlier than expected and we got them 3 days after ordering. The furniture was beautiful and the staff that put it together did a great job going up and down the stirs without damaging the pieces. They were very patient with us as my mother and I had them move things around a couple times. Overall, great customer service and reasonable prices. We will be back for other pieces.
1;Poor customer service, lines are always long, overpriced merchandise. I stood waiting in the laptop department waiting to PURCHASE a new laptop and it took well over 10 minutes for me to even be acknowledged. \n\nTip, brose laptop choices in-store, make purchase online.
4;Yea. this place rocks. It's fun - food is great - it's a WONDERFUL place to take out of towners, business cohorts, and friends. \nThe food is just superb.\nThe service CAN BE spotty - but I wouldn't knock them down a star just for that.\nIt just rocks.
0;"Went in looking for a specific item and asked the employee on duty for her opinion - all she could say was that the more expensive ones were \""better\"". I then walked to Target next door and found the same item for much less $$. Fail."
3;I took my out of state friends here for a Sunday brunch on our way to tour the Dam.  We almost went for the typical brunch. But then we were told about the breakfast bar in the next room. You can order made to order omelettes, Waffles, pancakes and they had a buffet bar as well.  My eyes were much bigger than my stomach, the omelette was very good, waffle with fresh berries was great, everything I tasted was very good. The service was good as well.
1;The monorail works if you're staying in a hotel attached to the monorail, or need to go to LVCC.  But  if your feet are hurting and you're only going one or two stops down, and think this is going to be helpful, don't bother.  Because the monorail is placed soooo ridiculously far in the back of the hotels that by the time you walk through the casino, through the gift shops, and possibly from across the street since it only runs on one side of the strip, and then do the same thing over again once you get out of the monorail, you could've walked from your point a to point b and saved the money.  In that instance, just take a cab.
0;mmm.. no. This is not how a hot dog should be. IS IT EVEN A HOT DOG? It's SO skinny. The buns overwhelmed the hot dog. This doesn't even hold a candle to the Costco hot dogs for a buck fifty. The price is ridiculous at 6.50 for a skinny dog with big-assed buns (They say size don't matter but it totally does). I guess it IS Vegas. The surrounding is disgusting as well. The tables outside were sticky and I just wanted to get out of there as soon as i sat down. LAME LAME LAME. Not coming back.
2;Seats and armrests need a major overhaul but other then that not a bad place.  Customer service was friendly popcorn was hot and fresh but out of coca cola. Heard a customer complaining that this was 3 days in a row they were out.  Maybe supplier problem. Screen was large and nice clear picture. Looked like they have recently been replaced.
1;"We went back and forth to where we were gonna enjoy our \""date\"" lunch and decided we want to start patronizing the \""local\"" small businesses/restuarants rather than chain restaurants so we ended up at Republic Kitchen....and what a joke.  They seem to focus on party's upstairs, maybe that's what is keeping them in business..  One server for the dining room which was also delivering food upstairs to the party.  Took at least 45 minutes to get our food and it was ok, not horrible but way over priced.  I'd normally cut the server some slack since she the only one on but her attitude was mostly the problem, not friendly at all!  No manager on duty that we could see and we where there for almost and hour and 45 minutes. We wont be going back."
1;Service was good.  Food was tasty.  Very pricey.  $10 for wings and $12 for a burger is pretty outrageous.  Very loud, but great TV setup for watching games.  My biggest complaint is they advertise free wi-fi and then they make it impossible to use.  Never did get online after asking the waitress several times and given bad login information. Oh and I guess they have TVs in the men's bathroom, but not the women's.  What's up with that?  Will try somewhere else next time.
1;"I went to this restaurant three separate times, each time ordering the rare steak pho, and each time the service was horrible. I have never been to a \""restaurant\"" with such inattentive staff before in my life. There is a sign at the door that says please wait to be seated, and if you follow the sign you probably will never eat. Each time I went to this place I had to seat my self. The first time I went here the food was pretty tasty, but the service was not very good. The waitress actually came over while I was on my phone and just grabbed my bowl while I was still eating. I mean all she had to do was ask. The Thai milk tea is tasty, but they fill up those cups with so much ice that you barely get anything.\n\nSecond time I came here I took my mother, we ended up sitting ourselves and I grabbed menus. By the time we were ready to order three separate groups entered and sat themselves. We waited for the waitress to take our order but what she did was go and take everyone elses order first! strike one. I do not know if it was a race thing or what, because she went over to the table seating an asian family, who came in the restaurant more than ten minutes after us, and took their order first. Then she went to each table that was seated much after ours before finally taking our order. My mother was very irked at the sight of this, I had to reassure her it is no big deal, even though it is extremely rude. The gentle man who works there brought all the other tables their veggies, bean sprouts, lime, peppers, branch ,etc, before our table got anything. Its funny because we did get our food before everyone else but we had no sprouts, or any of that, I had to ask for it. My mother loved the food, enough so that she wanted to go again. The chef was very nice and she did come out and apoligize for the fact that they were understafed, she should have said that the staff was undertrained.\n\nWhat really got to me the second time was that we asked for light ice in our thai tea, the waitress kept saying,\""less ice yes, less ice\"" I kept saying no we want light ice, just a little ice, not too much ice, she repeated,\"" yes, less ice\"" when we got our tea it was filled with ice. This simple thing really got on my bad side. How rude!!\n\nThe third and last time i will ever sit in this place was a couple days ago, I went with my mother and we ordered the same thing as the previous. We actually had to ask for ice on the side so there was no confusion, It was a really bad mistake. The Thai tea with no ice was not layered so it was pretty gross. I think its also because with no ice they put a lot more half and half. When the food came out it was not hot, it was warm but not hot. I ate it anyway, until I just lost my appetite. This is the final time I will ever eat inside this place. Maybe I will get something to go, but never will I set foot in this place to eat ever again. \n\nIts hilarious, the waitress grabbed my mothers bowl without asking, just thinking that she was done, I had to tell her that she was still eating. My mother was irked at the fact that she did that and just told her that she is done now. \n\n\nThis place needs to sell their new Tv's and hire a hostess and new waiting staff. or at least Train their existing staff to be competent. They should also dim the lights, it is not a robertos, so quit acting like it is. I would give this place a one star if it was not for the food being fairly decent.\n\n\nI really wish that this place was replaced with Monta Ramen or something similar."
2;Went here with some girls friends on a Wed evening. We usually go to PB Bakery...but wanted a change. Of course it's very hard not to compare the two. Overall I think the portions of soup and sandwich were smaller than I expected. I had the Gorgonzola mushroom soup and it had great flavor. I also had the vegetarian sandwich...I am pretty sure they forgot the cucumber...but I usually pick that out so all was good. There was about a 2 minute wait and they were out of detailed menus but the staff did their best to guide you through what was on everything. The best part of the experience...the apple bread pudding!!! WOW! I will he back for that...and to try breakfast!! 3 stars because I think they are a little overpriced for what you get.
3;Such a fun place! The sauerbraten, pretzels and potato pancakes were delicious. I had the lager, which was a good beer. The entertainment was really fun, especially after 9 when everyone was standing on the benches and singing along with Steve Grkman. Go with a group of friends, this place is super fun! Recommend to anyone looking for a casual, but energetic experience.
4;Food was great! Quality, price, variety and proportion was right on. We have a few places similar to this in Orange County but the thing that really stood out to me was the customer service. Everyone was so nice to us and they were also very kind to each other which made this an extra pleasant experience. I wish I could remember the name of the girl who helped us to specifically compliment her but it was a LONG week and I'm drawing a blank so great job EVERYONE!
3;I thought the slot machines were pretty welcoming. It gives the feeling you're in Las Vegas even when you are on the way out of state.
3;This little take away counter is overlooked  and some people might not even know it exist, but I can't even walk into this Harris Teeter without some hot red curry coming home with me.  It's also really reasonable. There are a few tables if you want to sit inside of the HT.
2;Hubby being from Houston and me eating a lot of mexican/texmex while we were dating.....mexican food anywhere else is like a joke. Unless you are willing to try cantinas # something. Now those are always the best! Anyway there are days when Hubby gets really nostalgic and craves Mexican food so we decided to try Las Margarita because it was close to home and it always looks packed when we drive by. \nThe service was awesome! we got so many refills of chips and salsa. The salsa was made fresh. The Margarita was really yum too. I ordered the chicken tacos and hubby got the fajitas. Both of us were satisfied with the dishes we ordered. Maybe there are other mexican restaurants that are more authentic out there but this place sure beats the typical on the border or chevys. But if you are about the ambiance rather than the food then this is not the place for you. Its a huge restaurant with great service and good food. Order a pitcher of Margarita and Enjoy!
3;Great little place. \n\nPerfect for a quick on the move lunch. \n\nThe hog was very tasty, generous serving in a white role with haggis and apple sauce, which were very nice with a scottish touch.  \nThe display of the Hog in the window adds to the experience :) \n\nI always get a hog roll from here when ever I pass by, even when I am not hungry. \n\nEnjoy
2;I'd recommend this place highly for two situations:  1.) You are on the west side of town and you want some reasonably priced grub, 2.) You've never had Vietnamese food and you want to try it out in a non-intimidating environment.  For those two things, PA is awesome!   \n\nNice people, decent food, and a very friendly environment. But their food doesn't stack up to the central Phoenix standard bearers.\n\nI suppose that their score is artificially low because of the category they are competing in.  Were they the only game in town, I suspect I would have rated them much higher - just to get my hands on a Bahn Mi every now and again.
2;Go to the South rim to really experience the Grand Canyon.  \n\nIf you drive here, be prepared that the last 12-14 miles is unpaved and quite bumpy.  Also, water can and will build up in certain areas so your car/rental car will probably look like crap afterwards.\n\nThis place is really just a huge money making sham since they charge you for just about everything. \n\nBottom line: The canyon is still awesome and you can't take away from that, but the price gouging is pretty bad.  The only activity worth doing here is the helicopter tour that takes you to the bottom of the canyon.
0;"I've been to CityScape three times in the past month and have yet to experience anything remotely worth praising.\n\nThe first time I went was with my girlfriend to check out the Lucky Strike bowling alley for the monthly mixer Radiate PHX. I had already heard about the alley's dress code, but I don't wear baggy clothes, sweat pants or sports logos so that wasn't a big deal. The problem we had was finding the entrance!\n\nAfter parking in the underground garage we took the closest set of stairs up to the plaza/mall/courtyard. We ended up on the North side facing Washington, just next to the new art/bent-paper-clip sculpture. Knowing in advanced that Lucky Strike was on the Southwest corner, we walked down 1st Ave to where the CVS drug store is located. We could clearly see the Lucky Strike signage, but not the entrance.\n\nIn what was hilariously reminiscent of a scene from 'This Is Spinal Tap', we spent the next 5 minutes trying every door, hallway, elevator and stairwell trying to figure out how to get into the place. Turns out there is no way to enter the 2nd floor from Jefferson! Whisky Tango Foxtrot?\n\nI'm a big fan of architecture (no, seriously: Last year I went to New York just to go on a walking tour with Taliesin students, I have dreams about Calatrava's work, I consider Will Bruder, Frank Henry & Michael P. Johnson my hometown heroes) so of course I started to really analyze CityScape. After a few minutes I could see that place has no distinction and was not built to human scale: its actually got less soul than Tempe Marketplace, Desert Ridge and West Gate! This place is not designed to serve those who call downtown Phoenix home: its obviously designed to appeal to all of the suburbanites who think fauxdobes and tuscan mcmansions are awesome.\n\nSo many people assume that if you criticize CityScape, you are somehow in favor of what was there before. Bullshit. Most sane people agree that Patriot's Square Park (1990-2006) was a flop and eyesore. The most often complaint is that is was a haven for the homeless. So did CityScape somehow make all these homeless people have homes, or better yet, just disappear? No. They simply displaced them into another area of town, just like all gentrification does. So don't give them credit for making the place \""better\"", especially when we lost a public park in the process.\n\nBack to the bowling alley: we eventually made it up the escalator and entered Lucky Strike. We entered what was mostly a Hard Rock Hotel Las Vegas atmosphere that was filled with conventioneers (Six Sigma trainees specifically). The irony of original Sheperd Fairey prints hanging in a place that enforces a dress code did not escape us.\n\nWe met up with the rest of the Radiate PHX crowd in a private, sectioned off area. We were offered various appetizers to sample. The chips and salsa were completely of the store bought variety: this is Arizona, don't do that shit. The other appetizers were a joke: typical Sysco or Shamrock foods frozen crap. The beers on tap at our bar? Bud, Bud Light and Stella. Have they never heard of The Roosevelt?\n\nI just now realized how much I typed about my first visit, which was actually the best time I had. I'll spare you the other stories for another day."
3;Walked n on a saturday evening around 6:45 and was seated within 10 minutes with no reservation.  Staff and servers were very friendly.  Had a spinach salad, calamari, and gnocchi. Food was great.  Will definetly come back if in Vegas again.  Live music was nice.  Atmosphere was a bit noisy.  \n\nThis is a great place to go and get off the strip with all the tourist a holes and drunk people.
0;Nice folks but the water softening system has a CAM/Piston that fails often.  Unless they change that I would not buy this unit.
4;My favorite bar. Great mix of people combined with the best thin crust pizza around (love the garden pizza) and topped off with a Crooked Tree on tap. I've never left disappointed!
0;Seriously if I could give it a 0...I would. The promoters here are so shady and you will NEVER see me go here again. If you do want to feel dangerous and try out this lamer than ever club I have one suggestion...NEVER\nEVER EVER ...use KORY as a promoter. KORY doesn't even know how to take care of his clients then treats them like trash. Seriously dude your young and cute now but....what will be your life plan AFTER this? Trolling more clubs? Oh my bad, back to the review. We used to go before when they had quality people working there but now they try to function as a mega club....which they will never be. I love how clubs treat locals like shit like we won't even recommend our friends and other tourists other places. Seriously we are definitely one of your money makers...but it's ok. Until KORY leaves to troll more clubs (hopefully not my favorites) and they get new management that does business right they will hear me talk about their bad business nonstop. It's a shame. Seriously, take your business to either XS, Tryst, and especially TAO. TAO has the sweetest bouncers and staff that you could ever imagine!! Trust me I will never stray away to wannabes again.
0;"Korean Food; perfect setting for all the ones that are too drunk to know what is good. Absolute garbage; not worth the trip!"
1;Food scaps, napkins, straw wrappings on the floor - and only about an hour into the business day on Sunday.  Not busy either, staff chatting with each other, so clearly there's no rush to clean things up from the Saturday night business.  They offer slices every day at lunch yet there were none ready (or in the oven) when I arrived.  Fresh pizza is nice, but when you go to a place for a slice, a major motivating reason is the short time it takes to heat up a slice rather than make a whole new pizza.  Looks like I'll be going to Ray's, Jo-Jo's, or Grimaldis now.
4;The menu is very creative and the staff are very nice. It is a beautiful restaurant and the atmosphere is great outside. This place is not very busy yet and hopefully it will catch on and fill up soon.
2;The food is fantastic and I love the layout of the large space Frida inhabits. Watched most of the World Cup games there this summer, and was pleased enough with the quality and speed of the bar service I recommended the place to fellow World Cup spectators, which increased my posse threefold by the finals. When we showed up for the France/Italy championship match, we were greeted at the door by a friendly hostess who was instantly interrupted by a man who reminded her loudly that all customers that day were required to order food. Between the time we walked in the door and our butts hit the barstools we heard this same man make the very same announcement to different staff members at least four times.\nNow, there are several problems I have with this: 1) you set up a temporary yet strict policy and want it enforced, you train your employees beforehand --not belligerently, and certainly not in front of customers. 2) Our group would have ended up spending twice as much money than we did if we hadn't been required to order food, since most of us had eaten already and were too full afterward to order the original barrage of margaritas we had hoped for. 3) The restaurant clearly wasn't prepared for the large task of making food for EVERYONE in there, as the service was excruciatingly slow, wrong meals were delivered, and the sound of falling trays and dishes was only barely punctuated by the bossman shouting insults to his staff. The experience was horrible. And the owner was the person responsible! Amazing.\nGo there for the food, go there for the friendly service and tip your servers well. But I personally avoid the place like the plague if the bossman is around.
3;1. $10 or less dinner prices\n2. Garlic Beef with Eggplants\n3. Chicken wings as a side item\n\n..ENOUGH SAID!\n\nThis my go to place when I want good, cheap Chinese/Taiwanese food. I recommend getting anything with the garlic sauce. It's my favorite!
4;After being hungry for this place for 8 months, I finally made it back here today, joined by friends Arlin B., Robyn N., Norm R., & Mike C.  I had a regular gyro, a good sized square of kibbee, & a salad with Middle Eastern dressing (of course!).\n\nThe gyro in particular was still the most amazing one I've ever eaten, except for the last time I was here!  My friends carped about this & that & the other thing, but for ME, & what I eat here, this place ROCKS!  We're talking amazing food at amazingly low prices!     :-))\n\nBIG Gyro $3.69, kibbee $1.99, regular dinner salad $1.29!
2;"Went for the first time after being told this was a must try by friends a few years ago. The place is very small, but cute the way it's set up. The waiter greeted us; however, was kind of appalled that we hadn't made a reservation. As first timers we weren't aware this was \""kind of required\"". The Italian bread that came out was delicious, but it went downhill from there. I ordered fettuccine alfredo with pasta fagioli soup to start. I was disappointed to get a soup with only one type of beans, pasta, huge chunks of tomato & it wasn't even warm - not like any pasta fagioli I have ever consumed before. Then the fettuccine..... Bland, flavorless sauce over noodles that tasted as if they were stored somewhere covered with mold and mildew! On the plus side, my husband devoured the lasagna. When asked if we wanted dessert, we declined, I didn't want to take my chances!"
3;Great pizza, always consistent, a little too expensive in my opinion but I understand they use quality ingredients and you get what you pay for.
3;I went the other day for lunch and the place is pretty good (really 4.5 stars). I got the cornbread enchiladas, a unique concept in and of itself, with the red sauce. The red sauce had a very mellow heat that didn't overpower the flavor and meshed well with the slightly sweet cornbread. \n\nI will definitely be back to try some of the other menu items and support a local business that is churning out excellent food at reasonable prices.
2;If you're at the Mandalay Bay Beach and pool, check out Border Grill for some fresh eats.  \n\nI was most impressed by the way they make their tortilla chips - I haven't had anything like this since Mexico!  The drinks are eclectic and the food is gourmet, fresh and healthy.  I vegetarian-ized the turkey tostado salad and it was yummy, as were the sweet corn tamales.  \n\nNo blown mind experience here but definitely a nice lunch.
1;"I finally got around to trying Laduca's, this is after being a frequent visitor of Minuto's which was formerly in its spot. I'm not a fan of Boar's Head meats which is what they serve so I opted to order an Eggplant Parm sandwich. I was told it'd be up in 5 minutes, it actually took 25. I took the sandwich to go, along with 4 links of hot Italian sausage. By the time I got back to my office to eat my lunch (less than 10 minutes) my sandwich was a soggy mess. This can be a good thing, but in this case it wasn't. This became a greasy disaster. I dislike when eggplant is masked by fried flavor. This was just that. I couldn't taste the eggplant at all, it could've been fried anything buried in acidic tomato sauce. \n\nI took the links home to grill. I haven't had much luck finding tasty sausage since Minuto's closed, I was hopeful Laduca's would be good. They were actually spicy, which was great because far too often \""spicy\"" is purely mild. The sausages were dry and had a really chunky texture. I prefer a finer grind of the meat, and I assume more fat, because I like them juicy and bursting with flavor. Aside from the spice these lacked any rich flavor. I guess my search continues..."
4;My sister and I came here last weekend as my prebaby pedicure. I had never been here before and decided to try it since it opened early on a Saturday. Cute place, friendly people and great pedicure. I will definitely be back!
2;This place makes an okay pizza. It's not as good as Big Jimmy's, but it's not bad. My biggest thing is that it doesn't reheat as well as Big Jimmy's (pizza stone in an oven on 475\u00b0F).\n\nThe biggest thing that bums me out about this place is that they advertise that they deliver until 5am. This is not true at all. I called the other day at 3am, and no answer. I called today at 4am, and no answer.\n\nThey do NOT deliver, or ever answer the phone, at the later hours they advertise.\n\nI'm not sure if business just slows down, so the crew cuts out early (I might be inclined to do this too, I know) - But dangit, when it's 4am and I want a pizza, pick up the damn phone people.\n\nOnly 3 stars for the false advertising. But the brunette counter girl that helped me last time in the store was hot, and the pizza is edible. So all is not lost on this place. Just don't call too late, they aren't open as late as they advertise.
1;"I'm not quite sure about  this place yet. I went for brunch on Mother's day with my parents, the atmosphere was nice, the service was attentive, but the food not that great. I had the stuffed french toast that really wasn't \""stuffed\"" at all it was just sliced and seasoned apples between slightly overcooked bread. I expected real maple syrup for the price of this dish, and the syrup was not real.  I think I'll give Pinot brasserie another chance someday for dinner, because brunch was definetly dissapointing."
4;I have to say without a doubt that Penny Electric, and Cole Penny and his crew are the Best electricians on the planet earth.\n\nWhile we got off to a bumpy start, when his crew arrived, it was like watching a cirque show, of highly trained people, ply there trade.\nthe work was done perfectly, and the price was beyond reasonable.\n\n5 stars is too low a rating for them!\n\nJonathan
0;Horrible service and hookahs took 40 mins to bring out ! What type of lounge operates like this
1;"I've been to this location a couple of times with an OK experience, but tonight we arrived 3 minutes before closing and the clerk had already turned off the open sign and locked the door.  We tried to walk up to see if he would change his mind but he wouldn't even look up for at least a minute, endlessly staring at the floor or at the walls in an attempt to avoid eye contact...low class move.  I would have minded less had he simply acknowledged us and said \""sorry we're closed\"".  It was almost closing time - I understand wanting to go home - but regardless it's not the way to treat customers.\n\nI have contacted what I presume is Smoothie King management (Greg) about this as well."
1;Food is OK at best. Food takes forever to come out. Do not eat here if you want good food or if you're in a hurry. I'd actually recommend going to the buffet over cafe. Same crap same price but buffet offers a bit more items.
3;Had the Miga Special. $19.95 and serves two people. Appetizers, 4 sides, a soup, and the main dish . Kim Chee is homemade and fresh. The Kim chee soup was good excellent. The restaurant is located in the remodeled food court. They also still serve Hawaiian style Korean food as well. I will return. Owner is very friendly, which is a plus!
2;I went here specifically for the red velvet waffle. Sad to say I wasn't impressed. It was just red. No coco flavor or anything that resembled red velvet cake. It was a well prepard waffle although. I would go back to try other things on the menu.
3;You'd think tickets were on sale for a Justin Bieber concert on Wednesday(s). That's when you typically find them offering a heck of a deal for their signature boxes of chicken with fries, dipping gravy, coleslaw and a bun. All this for $4.99 plus taxes will do that. Currently, I believe they are running a two box special for $13.99 plus taxes - still a good deal, but less worthy of a snaking line up. If you get the chef's choice (thigh or breast) you usually save a buck. Check with them for the exact specifics - if you are in the mood for some rotisserie chicken - I'm just sayin'.
4;It takes balls to open a higher end eatery in old Buckeye, but with the quality of food provided, I hope this becomes a destination restaurant. I had the Roasted Border omellete for breakfast and it was wonderful. Quality throughout with fresh tomatillo salsa, green chilies inside, and home fried potatoes to die for. This place does delicious food, not half assed massive portions for the typical patron of Denny's, so don't complain about not having a plate the size of a hubcap. It's wonderful food at a reasonable price. I'll be coming back for lunch....maybe today.
3;This was a really nice event. The desserts were great and the \nbeverages were often top notch. The only thing I didnt like was that \nfor me personally there is only so many sweets I can eat. I almost wish\nthey had some other food venders there to help ease the sweets down. \nI know i know.. why go to a chocolate festival right..! It was still delicious! \nThey had plenty of variety of different drinks which I liked. From wine to sangria to champagne it was all a treat and all the vendors were very friendly and made the experience that much better. \nI would absolutely go again next year.
1;Alas Orange Table, your location is excellent and your menu tantalizes. It is grossly unfortunately that the food and location are considerably offset by a staff so rude that it might actually make you entertain the idea of an encounter with flesh eating zombies. The wait times can be measured in a millennial scale as well, the tables seemed to linger uncleaned for quite sometime before anyone could be bothered to tidy them up for the next round of customers. Honestly, we felt as if you could have built the Great Pyramid of Giza in the time it took to get seated. While the Jalape\u00f1o Pecan Pancakes were outstandingly prepared and perhaps even bordering brilliant, I just can't get away from the fact I spend a small lifetime standing about for a seat and would honestly not have been surprised if the wait staff had tried to gnaw off my arm. Overall it presented a vastly disappointing experience.
0;"I totally agree with a lot of these other posts.  I flew from SFO to Toronto and Toronto to Montreal and back to SFO (from Montreal).\n\nFirst of all, no snacks (like cheap pretzels or crackers or even peanuts)!  I mean come on, that is one strike.\n\nSecond, was the attitude.  I had some trash from my lunch (so it was more than just a plastic cup and some napkins) and when a flight attendant walked through providing water and cups to the passengers (which, I have to say they did often and it was appreciated) I tried to hand her my plastic bag and she scoffed, \""I only have two hands\"" and walked away.  She never bothered to come back either.\n\nWhen the flight attendants were walking through with food to purchase, never, did any of them ask whether I wanted to purchase anything- they just wisked the cart past me every time.\n\nThere were other things too like the movie/TV selection was quite limited and didn't change from trip to trip compared to other airlines.\n\nI think I won't be using Air Canada again."
4;El Conquistador is the best Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. My wife & I have been going here for 10 years and it is always consistently great. Owned by a husband & wife... Maria who is the chef & Mark who is always smiling and greeting customers. I'll never understand why this wonderful restaurant is never rated in the top 5 Mexican restaurants in Phoenix.\nThe Poblano soup is unique and I have never seen it anywhere else.\nWe travel to Mexico a lot & this restaurant is as authentic as it gets.\nAs far as we're concerned it's Numero Uno. Viva Maria & Mark.\nKeith
3;Came here during Memorial Day Weekend! I'm not sure why all the low stars. Me and all my friends had a blast but I guess it might be that we are more easy going and easy to please.\n\nThe music was good! J-cole was off the hook! We were right up front by the stage, in the shade. I was hung over but surprisingly, I lasted the whole day without having to sit down.\n\nSaw a lot of hot boodies! Ass and boobies, I'm not going to lie. It was nice. LOL.\n\nLots of fake boobies and girls with hella make up and heels! \n\nWe were on the guestlist but we lagged so we didn't make it in time. Girls had to pay $20 to get in and the guys had to pay $50 to get in. Since we were in Vegas, we didn't care so we paid and once we got it, it was super fun!\n\nFor sure, I didn't go in the water. It was majorly packed and nasty looking. =)\n\nI think if you don't mind throwing down some cash, then this place is all right. Drinks are expensive also.
2;It was pretty tasty and the prices were good. We called in our order, walked in and payed. Then waited 20 minutes until I asked where was our food. They handed me a bag that was sitting behind them the whole time so our food was now cold and not as fresh. Service is were they lacked.
4;I had to add a review after reading that Portillo's uses frozen crinkle french fries.  Jimmys uses a whole potato and slices it right in front of you - nothing frozen.  Jimmys is great.
4;You have to order the Combo Pan Roast.  It is heavenly!\n\nLook for deals from station casino and you can find gift certificates for half price.
4;I hate the freaking sun and that it beats down my house all the time.  Thanks CC, I don't have that problem any more, I have a lower power bill too. Holly crap CC I think I'm in love.
4;The filet medallion is superb!
2;Came in here expecting great things considering I was craving both a hamburger and a taco and couldn't make up my mind. I thought a cheeseburger and short rib taco sounded great, especially considering it came with my two fav ingredients: onion and cilantro. Well I was really hungry, drove into a very busy drive thru and decided to dine in. Only one problem: one girl was working the register for drive thru, naturally, and there was a guy both working as a runner and a cashier which meant I did not get service until 10-16 minutes later . I ordered what I wanted and thought it as nice that they offered free fries on Mondays. So I get my order, decide to find a seat outside and find that my leggings nearly ripped a hole when it got caught on a sharp end on one of the cheap aluminum chairs. Had there actually been a rip I would have been so angry. But only, just a pilled part that I need to scissor off. Also, my taco did not come with any cilantro like it said it would as well, although he food was good.Anyway, I wasn't all that impressed with my first experience. Not sure if it's worth coming back...
0;Terrible car wash. They are so busy that they let the vehicles air dry instead of wiping them down but when they do wipe them it's with a wet towel.   Worst car wash ever. Streaks where they did wipe down. Windshield dirty inside and out. Road and bug residue all over the front after the wash. Outside rubber and plastic treatment applied with many missing spots.   They may do good elsewhere but don't recommend this place at all.
1;"I guess I really can't complain because I received the room for free (parents are Vegas junkies and they get free rooms at different hotels all the time).  But Planet Hollywood is not the best place I've stayed when I'm in Vegas ... and it's definitely not a place I would ever stay at again.\n\nPROS:\n1. The view (21st floor) was nice.  We had a view of Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, and the PH's pools located on the 6th floor.\n\n2. Valet parking. Pay the extra money for valet parking because it is a timesaver!!!  For self-parking, you need to trek the whole continent of Asia!  For self-parkers, you will need to walk the entirety of the Miracle Mile shops, go through the casino, and down the escalator until you get to the Registration area of PH.\n\nCONS:\n1.  Windows were filthy.  Though our view was nice, it would've been better if the windows were cleaned on a regular basis. For an establishment like PH, I assume they would pay the extra money for window washers to clean the outside of their windows.  They were disgusting.  Parts of the filth were so thick, I can imagine myself scraping it off with my fingernails.\n\n2.  No refrigerator?!?!?!  Like I said above, our room was comped.  But for a typical Resort Room (which is their basic room at PH), there was no refrigerator.  Hmmm ... enough said.\n\n3.  No cabinet/drawer space.  When my fianc\u00e9 and I travel, even if it's for 2-3 nights, we ALWAYS unpack everything.  Clothes go in drawers, get hung up on hangers in the closet, shoes are placed single-file at the bottom of the closets, and all our luggage is neatly stacked away.  But there were only 2 drawers (half-size drawers, mind you) in the entire room. There was the armoire where we can hang some of our clothes, but hardly any drawer space for socks, underwear, undershirts, shorts, etc.  \n\n4.  Cords everywhere.  It's a pet peeve of mine to see tangled cords from light fixtures, lamps, alarm clocks, etc. just in a jumbled mess on the floor.  Tangled, lifeless cords were bunched up underneath the desk and along the wall.  They are ugly and a fire hazard.  \n\nC'mon Planet Hollywood!  If you want to be a prestigious hotel, you need to make more of an effort (from your basic rooms to your high-end suites).  There should be no \""fine line\"" distinction between your differences in accommodations.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I would NEVER pay money to stay at Planet Hollywood.  We've heard better reviews from their Towers section, so we might try it one day in the future.  But from now on, we'll stick to our faves: Aria and Bellagio."
2;"Grade; C-\n\nI don't understand why people make such a big deal out of this below-average place. Lemmings... Food Fight Inc. fools Madison yet again. Don't believe the hype."
0;I went to phoenix skin in August 2013 to discuss about laser resurfacing. The doctor who I had met on that day had no idea about laser skin resurfacing and she gave me details about Blanca Fergoso, surgical coordinator  in phoenix skin care. I tried to schedule an appointment with her but when ever I tried to call her all the time it went to voicemail and even called the help desk to schedule an appointment with her but of no help.  I went to phoenix skin after lot of research and good reviews but of no use. If they won't care about their patients why would I recommend phoenix skin care please avoid Phoenix skin care.
0;Prepaid for facial deal and now phone is shut off and I assume they are closed based on another review. Very unhappy!!!!!  And they told me to buy the $35 vouchers...glad I didnt do that too!
0;The picture shown is a lie!  Your burger will not look like that!  When I walked in, it was full of baseball leagues, that should have been a sign.  The staff looked confused and about 6 people asked me if I had questions about the menu, which I did!  I asked if there are alternative burgers aside from beef or quinoa?  She said she didn't know.  Well, back to the confusing menu.  I decided to get a burger with cheddar cheese, grilled onion, burger-fi sauce, and mustard.  I assumed it would come with at least lettuce and tomato, but it didn't!!!  So, my burger was smaller than a cheeseburger from McD's, slopped over with some Kraft single looking cheese, and I honestly could not differentiate between the burger and the grilled onions because it was slopped on there.  Keep in mind, there was no burge-fi sauce on it either and when I asked for it, the one at the counter looked confused!  I also ordered a draft beer, she went to pour it and it was out... she said they were out of it!  So, I said, can you change the keg and she looked at me like I was talking another language.  So then she handed me a bottle of beer and asked if I would like this instead.  THEN, I ordered the fries that were described as parmesan fries with garlic aioli.  THEY WERE NOT!  They were cold, limp, and the cheese had no flavor, and the aioli was gross mayo with no garlic to it.  I specifically tasted each element individually and there was no flavor, the ingredients were poor quality, and the service was poor.  Sorry I am not 8 and a member of the MUSTANGS baseball :/ but this food was not good.
2;Located downstairs of the Palazzo, very convenient. The food here was OK, but I expected a little more. \n\nWe had just arrived to Vegas and got our room. Saw a coupon for this place so we gave it a try, and plus it was quick and cheap. There is a to-go window right outside of the restaurant so we decided to pick up some food and eat in our suite. \n\nWe had the tater tots (can't go wrong with that), the short rib sliders (not that great) and my boyfriend just had a regular burger. Food was not that great, but they are opened until midnight!
3;We didn't know what to expect with this place, but we were pleasantly surprised. We actually only went there to watch a game since our cable was out. We got our drinks and Max's tater tots half off since it was happy hour. We got a Cobb salad and a party melt. Both were huge, yummy, and very well priced!
1;Saltiest ham, egg and cheese biscuit I've ever had. I can feel my blood pressure rising. Coffee was pretty lousy too. The potato rounds were ok.
2;Food is tasty, though portions are for the waifish hipster types. Location is inconvenient and I would not recommend people walking by themselves at night on that stretch of Penn. Service is very uneven i.e. bad, even when the place is practically dead. I can't really speak on the coffee, though they do have good tissanes(however getting them to refill your hot water is another thing).\n\n**************\nOkay I won't change my rating, but I take back what I said about the food. They have changed the menu and it is really bad. \n\nWe had Buffalo Tofu sticks which were ridiculously dry. \n\nI had the Thai Peanut Tofu Wrap which tasted just like peanut butter. \n\nI don't understand the point of Mockamole? It's made with peas instead of avocado. \n\nHow to describe the food... it's as if they took pictures of how food should look and made the food without thinking about how food should taste. Gee peas are green, just like avocados?? \n\nI would go there for coffee/tea or whatever to hang out, but not for the food. \n\nOkay there was one decent thing on the menu which was the artichoke dip. I was completely disappointed.
3;"Oh the power of yelp! As enticing as this place was I never gave them a shot because of the bad reviews.\n\nI went to lunch yesterday and I had a really good time. Maybe they are really looking at these reviews and taking them to heart? \n\nFirst off the restaurant is beautiful, spacious, modern, and clean. \n\nWe were seated quickly and there was no wait as it was slow. \n\nI only had one bad thing and it was the strictness of their AYCE time limit. I totally get it but the lady was kind of rude about it. We were waiting on one person and were super hungry! So we wanted to order edamame as a starter. She gave us the whole speech about not being able to switch from a la cart to AYCE and I totally understand-it makes sense as I've done AYCE plenty of times at other places. I understand as they have a 60 minute time on the AYCE. My issue is could we not have just ordered the edamame and paid al a carte for it AND THEN decide to get AYCE when the other person arrived? I think yes but apparently we couldn't. My issue was just her approach. It's essentially putting more money on our bill so why not? Anyways.\n\nAfter that everything went well. We had three people helping us, refilling drinks, and bringing our food. The servers were all nice and checked on us frequently.\n\nWe did end up getting a la carte. The prices are affordable for that. Miso soup was like $1.50 and edamame was like $2.50 so aside from AYCE they have some affordable a la carte options.\n\nThe thing that's unique about this establishment's menu is that they offer \""tapas\"" or small plates. They have a few standard salads, the traditional AYCE sushi appetizers, and then more unique tapas dishes like agedashi tofu. \n\nI don't know if it's because we ordered a la carte but the presentation on these dishes were beautiful.\n\nWe got two orders of edamame, agedashi tofu, a house salad, sea weed salad, miso soup, spicy salmon roll, a golden California roll, and a shrimp tempura roll. With a coke and water it was about $40 bucks. Totally should have just got AYCE but I thought it was a good price.\n\nNone of the food was anything special except their rolls and the sea weed salad! Their rolls had the right amount of rice and they didn't over use the eel sauce. I love eel sauce but it really can overpower with it's sweetness or ruin the texture of the other components.\n\nThe spicy salmon roll was really good as it had large cubes of salmon instead of being mushy paste like most places.\n\nThe shrimp tempura roll was so good. Either I got the piece where the two shrimp usually meet up in the middle or they are really generous with the shrimp lol. They also wrapped it in soy paper which was a nice touch IMO.\n\nThe golden California roll was also good. They didn't use a heavy tempura batter so it was surprisingly light and and since they didn't douse it in sauce it was really crunchy. \n\nThe agedashi tofu was surprisingly good also. I had to try something off of the tapas side and this is my favorite thing to order whenever I see it on a menu. I wish they served it with a spoon though or else the broth is hard to taste. They fried it well and it was delicious although not the best I've had. \n\nOverall I'm glad I came and will definitely be back."
1;What is with the super high reviews for this place?! \n\nThe food was SO mediocre and I felt disgusting afterwards. \n\nTwo stars for the large portions and pretty fast service, but I couldn't even finish a quarter of my food. \n\nI split the chicken fried steak, biscuits and gravey and california omlette.  Everything was super average.  You know when you can tell if a dish is appetizing from the moment you see it? When I saw my chicken fried steak, I knew it was overfried, the quality of meat was NOT good, and the Cali omlette was simply too greasy and just overall Blah.  The biscuits and gravy was huge--and just Not good. \n\nI can't even get into the specifics about the composition of the dish and the flavors, the meal was not worth the calories and grease.  \n\nYou'd think Vegas would have great bfast joints bc of the amount of hungover people in search for greasy hangover cures, but i was extremely disappointed here. \n\nThe diner coffee and the country fried potatoes were the only good things about this place.
3;"If you are 40+ the odds are you will love the place. If you want the \""party-till-u-drop\"" type atmosphere, you should stay elsewhere.\n\nOne star subtracted because you have to stay around the lobby area for free WiFi (ask for login code at the Front Desk) which is very slow to download. I had to cancel my Apps download after trying for 30 minutes. This should have taken 5 minutes max. I am glad the Front Desk person advised us not to connect to the paid room WiFi service company mentioned in their property book because the service is very unreliable. This saved me that frustration + $10, at least.  AT&T phone service sucks here. Unable to send emails or IMs via an iPhone 4S or 3G. TV has basic channels only. With no room high speed Internet service my DirectTV HBO TOGO service or any TOGO TV service does not work. \n\nLoved the king size beds and the space. If you like protein for breakfast go someplace else. The AC is literally a \""blast\"". In the living room there are 2 large round vents that can not be adjusted. If you sit or sleep on the couch a vent blast the couch, as the AC cycles. B-r-r-r-r! If you adjust the AC to use the couch the bedrooms get hot. If you adjust the AC to get comfy in the bedrooms, the couch area is to cold. We clipped a face towel to the vent using 2 office alligator paperclips to deflect the air stream toward the floor, since the vents do not move. (See my photo). It worked.\n\nBreakfast is a carbohydrate laden affair (big bagels, sweet pastries), strong coffee (Starbucks is next door) and watery juice. I did not see the fruit mentioned by some others. Take the room coffee cups over or you have to use the small Styrofoam cups provided. If your stomach is on east-coast time, the 8AM breakfast start time is to late anyway.\n\nVery nice pools with sand. BBQ area and tools are a nice touch also. The bus transportation to the \""strip\"" and a few other casinos is very useful."
4;I've been to other smashburger locations. This one is definitely my favorite! People here are always friendly and helpful, which makes the delicious burgers and fries more enjoyable!!
4;These guys know their beef!! Never had a better day at the butcher than I have here at The Butcher Block! Their deli sandwiches are DELISH and easy to pick up on the way out to mountains or the lake. Love it here!
1;"I sincerely wish I could write a 5 star review for E2 but I just can't. Which is unfortunate since it is the perfect location for a visit to the museums or Knight Theater. Last Friday there was a big crowd due to crawfish night and the volume level was really loud. Not so much because of the crowd but I think largely because of the acoustics. \nWe started with the kale Caesar salad. This is a good idea but because kale if pretty firm, it would have been better with some other green mixed in. Also the pieces of kale were not bite sized. We also ordered the grouper with black rice and mussels. The fish was seasoned nicely and cooked perfectly but I felt the rice was a bit overcooked. The mussels had an off-taste - didn't finish them!\nEveryone we encountered was pleasant and friendly. However, their \""tag team\"" service style caused some disconnect here and there. As in, one server not knowing what the other server had done. In general the service was slow and the bar service was really slow.\nThis is my 3rd or 4th visit and I'll probably find other places next time."
1;Would have been a four star review except for the waiter Arnold who seems to think high pressure waiting is acceptable. Even after we told him we were in a rush he kept us waiting for over fifteen minutes before asking if we wanted dessert. He was too busy chatting with co workers. AVOID!!
4;This is the best OG the West Valley
4;PINBALL HEAVEN!!\n\nThis is THE place to fall in love with pinball machines for the first time or all over again!\n\nTHE GOOD\nAround 200 pinballs and tons of classic arcade games, most of them in fantastic condition, ready to be played and loved. Tim and his buddies keep them in top shape, bumpers and flippers are snappy and crisp. They also have some rare stuff in there that you won't see anywhere else.\nPlus they donate TONS of MONEY to CHARITY, very cool!\n\nTHE BAD\nThe building itself is an ugly commercial box and some of the corners inside are filled with pinball and arcade scraps and junk. Don't let small kids run around there (you shouldn't do that anyway).\n\nTHE UGLY\nThis place is out in the middle of nowhere, if you come by cab it might take quite a while to get a cab back to civilization (use the 7-11 to hang out or have them call a cab, that seems to work better, see below).\n\nMAKE IT BETTER\nThere is a used videogame store right next to it which carries a lot of games for older systems (incl. Nintendo etc.). Also a 7-11 at the corner from which you can call cabs and where you can get cheap drinks/food.
3;Great service.\nThe food was really good.\nThere were only 5 other tables being served (quiet weekend?)\nA tad pricey.\nToo bad they are in MGM hotel, the sea of drunk people walking by detracted from the ambiance.
4;"As stated previously, we've been coming here for years.  Well before the management from CA came in and took over.\n\nWe have a lot of cleaning done here routinely and because of this we get a bag to toss all our stuff in and they give us a small discount.  The discount isn't a lot but the fact we get it with every order makes a good difference.\n\nAny piece of clothing that has come back with a spot has been brought to the attention of the person behind the counter, the item is sent back to be recleaned and if necessary I sign off so the item can actually be laundered.\nTo date I've had more luck and success with this dry cleaner than I have with some of the other local (CHEAP) dry cleaners.  One such place totally lost my entire order and treated me like I was a raving lunatic.  Damn I should've called 12 for Action on them, but I was upset at my loss at the time.\n\nAnyway, a couple of recent rants and bad reviews, including one that suggested that the person giving this company five (5) stars must've been \""compensated\"", caused me to come back and update my review with additional details.\n\nI've worked various jobs in customer service over the years and I can tell you it's one thing that hardly exists these days.  However, when I've had an issue I brought it to their attention and things got straightened out.  And believe me, I wasn't happy in those situations.  But they rectified the situation and that IS the customer service which causes me to be a happy and satisfied customer.\nMy 20+ years of going there is by far a more realistic view of this business.\nSo IF they did a poor job you need to send it back to be done right.  If you don't do that then you only have yourself to blame."
0;Because of my noobness, the location is wrong, though they are mostly the same, I couldn't figuer out how to change the address..\n   I want to say the Scottsdale location is better than the Tempe one and the one I mentioned in Oregon. I saw a sweet Johnny Winter signed 67 SG that I did have a stiffy for. But 8grand, please.. Bizaar will get my 8 grand long before GC does.. \n\nOK There are no pros for this crappy place except getting to bang out or explore options before I purchase somewhere, anywhere else. First off the reason they have these incredible blowout sales is because the equipment is always inflated or wrecked. The guitar set up is the worse you can get, though no fault of the few good folks that work there. My advice, just go there to beat up crap like everyone else and then purchase online or somewhere else. I saved $1300 on a digital recorder from Yamaha, then went to Guitar Center (in Oregon) for some cables and mics. I was nagged at by a dude there wanting a commision.. I told him $1300 bucks DUDE!!! They never give you a deal on what you need, just what they want to sell...
2;They have good customer service and friendly waiting staff but the food could be much better. Last Friday I went with some friends for dinner and I was not impressed. I ordered the chicken Caesar salad and the waiter brought a salad with salmon...no problem, a simple mistake, he took it back and two minutes later he was back with the salad, which I could tell it was the same from before since it still had the fishy smell and taste of the salmon, the chicken was pre-cooked and warmed up probably in a microwave and thrown in the salad, no croutons, no bacon bits, and mozzarella cheese instead of Parmigiano, the cook didn\u00b4t even bother to remove the portion of the salad in contact with the fish...so it was a rather kinky salad,  a salad that smelled like fish but tasted like chicken...I\u00b4ll assess my options next time I think about a place to go
0;Wish it was better. Wasn't sure the shuttle was going to show. It arrived 15 mins late. Guide did not top talking the entire trip. Spent to much time in lines.
3;I take my husbands dry cleaning here because of the great price. Their quality on dry cleaning is great. I take my husbands business shirts (laundered) elsewhere because I don't believe they come out as well as the dry cleaning does.
2;"I was eager to enjoy the historic Arizona Biiltmore Hotel on my recent stay in Phoenix. I chose the hotel for its reputation and connection to the Frank Lloyd Wright. Unfortunately, I was not impressed at all, other than the opulent lobby, the hotel has seen better days. I was \""upgraded\"" to a Villa and did not feel it was an upgrade. The furniture was dirty and threadbare, the appointments were old, even the two TVs were bulbous variety in cabinets. The staff was pleasant enough, but was disappointed with their efforts, the pool staff was non-existent. All in all, I wouldn't select this property again until it is remodeled."
3;Decent food, non-existent service, they have a daily buffet including pizza, pasta, broasted chicken and salad bar for $6.49. I pretty much come here for their broasted chicken which is very juicy and delicious. Pizza and buffet are decent, but if you order off the menu the food is a lot fresher
2;"Was out and about on a Sunday night with a couple of girlfriends and one wanted to stop at Ichi Ban and since I have never been, I was up for the adventure.   When we walked in their wasn't that many people there, maybe a handful and I have to say service was fast & friendly, and that's always a nice touch.\n\nI ordered the tempura, teriyaki beef with 6 California rolls; I have to say the tempura was delish! It was light, crispy and very good, was sad when it was all gone.  The teriyaki beet had good flavor, but I wasn't impressed, the California rolls were fresh and tasted good. \n\nWe also ordered some rolls & nigir and have to say I wasn't really that impressed with some of the rolls.  I am glad I got to check it out, have heard friends talk about the place before, but I'm not sure if I will be coming back any time soon."
2;I'm sorry. I like Zen for what it is and all, it is good, better than the other places I've tried in Vegas however it just seems too plain for me to be a fan of. Is it more that curry, rice, and fried stuff!?\n\nThe menu is simple you order what kind of curry you want (original, vegetable, or spinach), what level of spiciness (1-5 is free and 6-10 is $0.20 extra), what rice (plain or brown), and what fried stuff you want included (pork/chicken/tofu katsu, pork/chicken tender, shrimp, sausage, and a few others). I've always ordered the original curry with levels ranging from 5-10 depending on the mood, it is good, has the flavors I like but I can never get it too hot to my liking even with the additional spices on the table, sure I'll sweat but I want to breath fire. Maybe it's not suppose to be too hot!? And I'll get the plain rice. The plates are pretty much half rice and half curry. I like the kurobuta sausages but the fried stuff is standard. I could easily eat one plate and be still hungry but drink plenty of water if you're a big eater like me. Adding additional items is an option but it also means adding to the price, which could turn pricey.\n\nThe interior is nice and clean. It does get busy occasionally so you might have to wait for a seat or even maneuver around while walking through the establishment. I've never had a problem with service, food comes out in a reasonable amount of time and staff is usually friendly, refill drinks, and handles checks. \n\nAsk for a smaller spoon or a fork cause the spoon they usually give you is huge.\n\nDon't let this review turn you away from going here the food's not bad or anything and I'd probably go back as long as others wanna go but you wont hear me raving about it.
4;The Ritz Carlton Montreal was truly an amazing experience.  Everything was extensively clean and the customer service was truly amazing!!  The concierge, Anna and Simone were truly a great help and super friendly.  Olivier in reception was a joy as well.  I celebrated my birthday and they truly pulled out all of the stops.  I entered the wonderful smelling room to a bottle of champagne.  To add, our second day I had rose petals on our bed.  So romantic!!!  If I could change some things, I would say that they have a very small pool area and if you would like to lay out be sure to get there extremely early as it is very small.  I also was expecting a bathtub in our room and apparently we did not have one. Also I wish that they had a gift shop or casual coffee/tea shop if you would like to stop for a snack.  Nonetheless, our experience was lovely and you do get what you pay for! I would certainly go back!  There is no hotel experience like the Ritz!  Memorable for sure!
3;My husband and I took our puggle out here for a walk on a Sunday morning. At around 7:30 AM the park was already bustling with people. The park is expansive and offers different diversions. Walking trails, bike trails, baseball, a lake/pond (stocked), and even beach volleyball courts are available for public use.\n\nWe started our walk in the desert conservation area of the park, which eventually loops you into the recreational areas. Passing by the lake we saw a variety of people, families, older adults taking a stroll, and young children playing.\n\nThe park feels secure and kept-up. We did see quite a few park workers driving around, picking up trash, and servicing the facilities in general. Doggy-poo bags were also available and stocked. Trash cans are placed throughout the park so there isn't anywhere too far away to dispose of your garbage.\n\nLuckily Sunset Park has been kept-up and is centrally located so it sees a lot of use. It is a good park with plenty to do and see.
3;I am not crazy about seafood most of the time, especially in a landlocked state, but this place is definitely worth writing about. Their fish & chips are insanely delicious, especially for the price. They give you a giant piece of beer-battered cod and a bunch of fries, plus some really good tartar sauce that may or may not have been made by Jesus Himself.\nThe place looks kind of divey at first, but it is very clean. We went during the day, so I have no idea what the night life is like, but it was a great sanctuary from the heat and they had some tasty-sounding drink options. The service was great - our waitress was lovely and we did not have to wait a long time for our food. This place turned out to be just what I needed to recharge my battery after a bad hangover.
1;What a disappointment!  We went to check it out, we sat at one end of the bar where it looks like a large common table.  We had a margarita and a blueberry lemon drop.  Yuck, their well liquor must be the worst I have ever had. I imagine that is what gasoline would taste like.  We could not finish those drinks.  We decided to cut our loses and leave.
2;A group of us came for dinner and arrived at 6:00. We were seated immediately. The restaurant is, to put it nicely, sparsely decorated, and is quite simple inside. However, don't let the lack of decor fool you. The food more than makes up for it.\nThis is the only Chinese restaurant in the greater Phoenix area that makes real hand pulled noodles. The last time I had noodles of this quality, it was in Hong Kong! \n\nThere is a big picture window where you can watch the chef stretching the dough and making any of the 5 kinds of noodles.\nI started off with the marinated beef tendon. Usually, you get a small plate with a little portion of the tendon on it. Here, I was surprised to get a big plate with a huge portion of tendon on it. To be honest, it was more than I could possibly eat, but we all made a good stab at it.\n\nNext, I ordered a portion of noodles with XO sauce. This is a spicy sauce that really brings out the flavors in foods, and I was not disappointed. It was fun to watch the chef prepare the dish through the window. All my guests were mesmerized watching the preparation. Each person ordered a different dish, and all were pronounced flavorful and excellent.\n\nService is simple, but quick. Considering the prices, one has to wonder how they can stay in business. Big plates of food at very low prices.\n\nWere it not for the simple decor, this place would easily rate 4 stars.\n\n3 stars for portion size and quality.\n\nA good place to eat your fill at a reasonable price.
0;Customer service is lacking at this location. The guy on the phone put me on hold and forgot to mute the phone or actually put it on hold. I heard the whole conversation with his buddy and other customers. \n\nBesides the ridiculously low trade in value they give you here (which is expected) the service is terrible. I won't go In here unless I absolutely have to actually no I rather go to Walmart (and that tells you a lot).\n\nI bought a new game but received an opened copy in a envelope sleeve. And I asked why that was and he said it was because they needed empty display cases. I told him I wanted a new one that was sealed and said he couldn't give me a sealed one. I asked him if the new copies came with any downloadable content he said he didn't no but most likely no.\n\nI should of left and spent my money else where. Lucky for them I was in a hurry.\nIt was on 11/24.
4;I just recent moved to Vegas and this is the first restaurant I ate at, since then I try to come almost religiously twice a week. I can honesty say it's amazing! Great service. Excellent food, especially the nigiri, super fresh fish. (\uffe3\u3002\uffe3\uff89)\uff89 I will for sure be a regular from now on.
1;Black Garlic Oil Tonkatsu Ramen\n- super SALTY, my tongue was slightly numb because of all the salt\n- broth was viscous and very fatty.  it was like liquid cholesterol.\n- pork slices was good\n\nunfortunately due to my stomach cramps followed by greasy bowel movements, I cannot give this place more than 2 stars
0;Boo!  What happened to this location?  It used to be happy and fun!  It just feels depressing and nearly everyone there is just doing the bare minimum to get by?  So sad.
0;The current staff lacks any customer service skills. Everything you would expect from a friendly neighborhood place, it is not. It is before 9am and they have 8 empty doughnut shelves sitting out. Have been here for the last 20 minutes and no shelf has been replenished, when clearly there is a demand. When asked why there is no variety, the reply was depending on whoever is in, that person makes a decision of what's needed. I would think there has to be a better approach to running a business.
3;Great find. Simple authentic Indian food. Nothing fancy but definitely gives me my Indian fix. The restaurant is small but clean. Good service and consistently good.  Really good value, especially for lunch as their Thali plate is really good.
4;Great food. Trendy atmosphere. This restaurant could be dropped in the middle of NYC rather than Pittsburgh - not many places in the burgh you can say that about. \n\nThe entree presentation was delightful, the servers were extremely friendly and inviting, and the overall experience was a 10 out of 10. \n\nI had been told to expect to leave hungry - BUT, I found just the opposite to be true. I was stuffed only half way through my entree (duck breast) but was craving more still. I look forward to my next meal at Salt, and I'm sure it will be very soon.
2;This stylish, sprawling place lives in several buildings, across the street from Fry's Electronics.  There's also a big patio available for outdoor dining when the weather is suitable.  I dropped in for lunch on this Wednesday, & the main building was already nearly full with a big, mixed crowd of hungry, noisy professionals & blue-collar types.\n\nThe service I received here was just amazing!  The hostess seated me at the available table of my choice as soon as I entered, & left me a menu.  Just as soon as I had picked what I wanted for lunch & closed the menu, my friendly server, Gerardo, showed up with a BIG bowl of chips & a BIG bowl of salsa, & took my order.\n\nAbout FIVE MINUTES LATER (if that!), the big, piping hot platter of my food landed in front of me on the table!!!  This is at NOON!  It might have been the best service I have ever received at any busy restaurant, anywhere, ever!!\n\nI had the Numero Seis Combination, which consisted of a Chile Relleno, a cheese enchilada, refried beans with melted cheese on top, & a generous serving of Fideo, which is angel hair pasta cooked in a seasoned, tomato-based sauce.  (Think Mexican style spaghetti.)\n\nAlong with the great service, I thought the food here was delicious, & they give you plenty of it.  The reason I have them down at tres estrellas is that it's expensive at $10 to $18 for lunch, & I wasn't crazy about the rigid Combination menu choices.  (Macayo's is equally good for half the price, & they let you make up your own combo!)\n\nNumero Seis Combination:  $11.25
1;I often go to marche27 and usually the service iis decent and up to par. It was my first time there for 5 a 7 and it was a total disappointment. The waitress didn't allow us to have just some fries with our drinks, she insisted we have an appetizer or entr\u00e9e even though all we wanted was bite food. We decided to order the edamame considering its the lightest appetizer only to be told it isnt even available, talk about false hope. Finally we got the salad and duck as appetizers and 2 walks 27. Both drinks were soda more than anything, it might as well have been a soda with blueberries, no hint of mint lime nor gin. I was truly heartbroken considering I go to marche 27 almost every week. I don't know it was the waitress (dark hair with a sleeve tattoo) or if it was just an off day at the restaurant needless to say I would never go back had that been my first experience.
4;I LOVE mediterranean food. Stephano's is one of the best things to hit the University area. $2 beers for rebel hours, all day everyday! It's not super greasy (aka better than pizza and burgers for college students). Food is AMAZING and portions are huge. Either leave here feeling stuffed, share a plate with someone, or leave with leftovers!\n\nThe fries with sauce and the lamb/beef gyro are my favorite. Be sure to request some extra tzatziki!
2;We enjoyed our night when we went to see Jon Reep.  We had a Living Social deal so the tickets were a pretty good price.  You still had a 2 drink minimum, though.  We got there early and got good seats but they are so close together.  The lady to the right of me was in my view all night and it was hard to maneuver around her.  The food was ok. We ordered the nachos.  I am not a picky eater but really didn't care for the cheese sauce they used.  It was kinda icky...like from a big industrial size can.  But, I wasn't there for the food so it's not a big deal.  We got our first drink which we both ordered beer.  For our second drink we each got an iced tea.  My husband finished his and the waitress came around with a pitcher and asked if he would like a refill.  What she failed to mention is that refills of iced tea are NOT free...I can understand that they are going to charge you for everything here but they really should have let us know that before serving it.\nOverall, the comedians were great and we had a good night out.  It's very pricey, though and not someplace we will be able to go regularly.
1;I didn't really LOVE my experience here, but for those who enjoy creative and fusioned sushi or a good sushi happy hour, this is a great place to go.  The menu is pretty impressive with all sorts of sushi concoctions that I have never seen, but I like my sushi pretty standard and not too crazy, so I ordered (ironically) the Crazy Horse roll, which is tuna, yellowtail, and salmon rolled with avocado and topped with tobiko.  I don't have TOO much to complain about regarding the size of the rolls (they were decent) or the taste (it was ok considering this is tempe, arizona), but I think I was most turned off by the service and prices of the restaurant.\n\nWhen my friends and I walked in, happy hour was happening, so it's understandable that the wait staff were busy, but come on.  Seat us already.  Or at least acknowledge us.  When we were finally seated, our waitress kept huffing and puffing while taking our order.  I understand she may have been having a bad day or have been stressed, but whatever.  Stay profesh.  Then, one of my friends orders the tempura mix, and when it came out, it was missing the prawns, so what happens?  The waitress brings out a single fried prawn on a plate...15 minutes later.  Um...no.  The age-dofu was also kind of meh.  On top of that, I was confused about who was actually serving our table because the girl wait staff kept tag-teaming our table with the guy wait staff, and even then, the service was not awesome.  The whole experience altogether just kind of totaled a bit too much for a sort of blah experience, so I'm pretty sure I'll be going elsewhere for sushi around these parts.
0;Zero stars! Filthy dirty.  Took way too long to get the food.  The hostess was rude and the server was bothered. The lady cleaning the tables was so obnoxiously loud.  Hope someone else has a better experience!
3;In the shade in the morning.   Great outdoor seating area.   Friendly regulars.  Good coffee.  Fresh pastries (in the morning).   \n\nAll in all, it's a nice version of a chain coffee store.  \n\nThe line will be out-the-door long in the morning until about 10:00am or so, but don't let that scare you:  They work through the line quickly.   \n\nThis is the favorite Starbucks of several of my friends in the area -- and considering they have about 5 to choose from in a mile vicinity, that should say a lot.
0;I had always been a 5 star fan of yellowfin, until one day.\n\nI am probably one of the more tolerant restaurant customers giving servers, and restaurants the benefit of the doubt.  It's true that sometimes servers have bad days and are grumpy, and that's no problem, we've all been there.  There are also sometimes mistakes in food, and likewise, a chef or sushi chef could be having a bad day.\n\nStill... when I was serve edamame in my lunch bento... and there were literally maggots coming out of the edamame... i was pretty horrified.  It was definitely one of those situations where you know the food is old.  The edamame was lifeless, brown, old.  And to my surprise, there were maggots in it having at it.\n\nSo being as tempered as possible, I alerted the server who apologized and took it away.  I was expecting one of two things... 1, the server (or owner) will come to the table, apologize, and comp my meal.  2, nothing will happen until I receive the check, and the meal will be comped on there with some kind of apology note.\n\nBy the time the check came, neither of the two happened.  Giving the restaurant one more chance to make right their wrong, I politely asked if I could get my meal comped since there were maggots in my food.  The server responded politely that the owner said there was no way for anyone to know there were maggots in the edamame.  Even though the edamame was all pretty much opened up with maggots coming out of them when it reached the table in the first place.\n\nSo... there you go, I gave every chance for them to make right their wrong.  Suffice it to say that getting maggots in your food is a totally unacceptable situation, they took it 3 steps too far by doing nothing about it before the check, on the check, or after the check.  By principle alone, and from fear that the rice, or even fish are likely aging beyond their safe tolerance levels, yellowfin gets a 0 star if I could give them one for committing egregious health code violations, and donig nothing about it.
2;I had the pastrami which was just ok, I've had better elsewhere, especially back in LA and NYC.  However, the burgers look ridiculously good, so I think I'll go back and try one of them.  And there lemonade is rather good, and I like that they can mix flavors of it as you want.
0;I work near here and for some time I would come here to get a coffee and a sesame bagel with sausage patty. It was a good price and pretty decent.\n\nA year ago I went to order this, and the lady at the cash was struggling to enter the order. Another person came to help out and asked for the order again, which I provided without stress as I was not in a hurry.\n\nThe second woman struggled again and used an extremely derogatory term in arabic which I will not repeat here. I confronted the manager about this for which she apologized.\n\nUpon getting back to work I noticed they had put no milk or sugar in my coffee. I went back to ask for them to add some. They then added so much sugar it was undrinkable.\n\nI have not been going back since. I think using intensely derogatory terms and taking vengeance after on a client is unnaceptable even more so when it's done in front of the manager.
4;I love skulls and skeletons, so I'm thrilled to have a shop that specializes in Day of the Dead gear. It's a pretty small store, but it's the kind of place where you can spend hours and hours exploring. \n\nI hit Pura Vida hard when I was getting stuff to decorate my Zen Den in my house. They have a wide selection of spiritual goodies, from Tibetan prayer flags to meditation gongs to all kinds of incense and candles and such. It's the best place in town to find the materials you'll need to get in touch with your inner goddess.\n\nThe staff is friendly and knowledgeable, which is impressive in a place with so much stuff. It would be forgivable if they didn't know the stories behind everything, but I've found that they know a lot, and they're eager to share. I wish we had more places like this one in Charlotte!
3;"I owe The Wine Shop an update. \n\nI live near by. My wife and I frequent this place and since this experience some time ago - seaming like ancient history.They have really stepped up their game. The food is quality and the staff has been significantly upgraded over the years. I have no problem telling you now that they know who we are and take VERY good care of us every time we come in. In all it's made for a consistent choice for an every week way to have good meal and a great glass of wine or beer. \n\nBeyond the fact I think their response to my initial review was very  disappointing....\n\nI would actually update to give them 5 stars if they just had more vegetarian / vegan choices for my wife AND they offered the tacos all day ;-)"
0;"DREARY\nDark rooms, chipped paint, peeling laminates, uncomfortable beds... Just pass on this sad hotel.  To enter the \""business center\"" a manager had to use a screwdriver to jimmy the door open revealing a computer 14 years old that wouldn't even print a boarding pass."
2;"A neat little sandwich shop in Downtown.  Blink and ya miss it.  They specialize in 8\"" subs.  They're a little too much for me to eat at one sitting, so I'll either split one or save half of it for later.  Most of the sandwiches have some pretty cool names:  The Old Geezer, The Cajun Cow, or the Dirty Bird.  My favorite is the Greek Bird:  chicken and cucumber sauce.\n\nFadz offers typical salads here too like the Greek Salad, the House Salad or the Steak Salad.  They have sides here too inluding fries and onion rings, but really these sandwiches are big enough on their own."
3;I've been to the New Orleans bowling alley and this one, and I would go out of my way any day to come here instead. This place has a way better atmosphere in my opinion.\n\nOpen 24hrs and with quite a few lanes, you rarely have to wait to bowl here. They have $1.50 games during the week and Sundays. Their customer service in the front isn't the best, but it's not terrible either, so I docked a star for that. Other than that, you are bound to have an awesome bowling experience here.
2;My hubby and I visited Calico Jack's this past Friday night (thankfully we didn't read all the bad review on here first). We took advantage of the Happy Hour drink specials and ordered the $2 margaritas to go with the complimentary chips and salsa.  We also grabbed the $5 appetizer specials and ordered the calamari.  Both were very good, although I prefer my calamari with a marinara sauce (they serve it with a sweet/spicy chili sauce).  For my entree, I ordered the La Torta, and I have to say that I was disappointed with it.  It's basically a grilled chicken sandwich with sliced avocado, but there was no seasoning to it--no salt, pepper, spice or anything. It was very bland.  The beans and rice that came with it were also kind of bland, so I smothered them with salsa.\n\nThe service was very prompt and courteous, and our food was delivered to our table promptly.  We really enjoyed the music soundtrack that was playing--a good mix of dance tunes on a great sound system--that was a big plus!  The ambiance was pretty cool, with a lot of leftover features from the former place (Bar Louie's), but now with a Baja vibe.\n\nWe would definitely be willing to try this place again, but would not order the same food choices.  My advice to Calico Jack's is to spice up the food and take good care of the customers!
0;I was not very impressed with the drinks, the crowd or the vibe at this hip bar/lounge smack dab in the middle of the Mandalay Bay Casino.  I was surprised to see an older crown (mid 30's to 40's) dominate the scene, I guess that is my fault for showing up on a Thursday.  But come on, where I'm from or where I have lived in the past Thursdays are our raging nights ( so is Friday, Saturday, Sunday Funday, Monday, Tuesday, Hump Day you get the gist...).  You would think this place would be some what classy, not very much.  I didn't even wear my going out gear, all I wanted was a nice cocktail or 2 and spend time with my Mom after our drive from Denver.  Stratosphere had no bars to offer us so we jumped in a cab and hitched a ride to Mandalay.  I would have rather had cocktails sent up to us by room service.  The other classy looking bar near the entrance was closed.  We ordered 2 drinks, my Mom was looking for a decent Cab they offered her BV.  BV?  Are they serious?  That was $15 and my Greyhound Up was $15 as well.  After tip we were down $40.  Ha.  At least my mom won$200 from the dollar slots.  I never get those machines.
0;go back to the days of standing in the 3rd grade lunch line. you are served up a weird textured burger on plain bun and it is so nasty you eat just enough to make it until you get to go home and not too much in order to prevent death by cafeteria food. this was very similar. even in the awkward freezer burn then microwaved scent. want to relive the elementary lunch room? take a visit here. \n\ni really hate to give 1 star but the entire hamburger and fries had to be trashed. so nasty.\n\nIf someone suggests going to Rallys for a burger you better scream no!!!!!!! \n\nI was hopeful, I had been a few times, never impressed but never disgusted, but i also wasn't paying attention bc i try to only eat at places like this if i'm in a hurry.\n\ntoday, i was disgusted. I don't know if my senses were on height or something but this food was stinky. i have a thing about microwaves and these burgers tasted and smelled microwaved. I'm not sure if they were but i don't care, that's even worse if they werent. the meat was kinda grey and the tomatoes were colorless. \n\nI always upgrade my drink to a large and they asked if i would like to rally my fries. i stupidly made the assumption that this meant large fries and usually places charge you less if you upgrade both, so i said yes. let me tell you what it REALLY means. it means they are going to put every nasty condiment on your fries and serve them to you with a spork. \n\nafter throwin my burger out i figured i could at least eat the fries(this was before i knew that they had been 'rally'ed up) \n\ni KNEW i could smell mayonnaise somewhere. i HATE mayonnaise. these fries were soaking in mayonnaise, and a bunch of other slop. I didnt take a very long look at all of the nasty things on top bc i had to trash it before i threw up. \n\nmy goodness it was so gross. i can't even handle how gross it was.
4;I just relocated to the Phoenix area and have been looking for a grooming salon.  I took my 2 shihtzu's here last week for the first time after checking it out beforehand.  I was very impressed with how clean and quiet the salon was.  Not a lot of barking dogs and noise like many other salons.  I am very particular about my dogs grooming and well being.  They listened to how I wanted them clipped and they looked great when they were done!  Also I noticed my dogs were not nearly as nervous or anxious here when I took them in and when I picked them up!!  It was a great find and will definitely be taking my girls there again!!!
2;They didn't speak hardly any English so that was plenty akward.. \nThe ice cream was okay..\nI had a bionico and I was highly disappointed. It was messy and the fruit tasted spoiled..I've had WAY better lets just say that..\nI would still probably come back.. with a translator..
3;Ah, The Old Spaghetti Factory. We first met in Tacoma whilst I played tourist almost 20 years ago. I've since bumped into you in Spokane, Denver and here in the homeland. For a chain, consistently good food for a good price. Salad and ice cream dessert included!
4;Seriously the best burgers in town! I wanted to lick my plate clean. Tater tots and onion rings are cooked to perfection.  Ask for Andrew. He is knowledgeable, friendly, tells great stories and makes a great drink!
4;I've travelled out of this airport for quite a few years now, and it wasn't until a recent trip that took my through Jersey that I came to truly appreciate Sky Harbor.\n\nBeing the hub for one of the largest and fastest growing cities in the nation, I am suprised I haven't experienced more delays than I have.  The only times I have experiened a noticeable backup at security is when it is to be expected (holiday weekends and such) and even then I have been suprised a time or 2 at how efficient it was.
3;I really do like this place for brunch/lunch.  I went there with my sister, her bff and my bf and we all had a good experience.  The good is great and really flavorful.  The only problem that I have is sometimes the service is hit or miss.  It took a while for us to get served at the beginning but the food made up for it.  \n\nI will return to try other items on the menu and to give the service a 2nd try!
3;"I was able to go to Ichiza twice over the past two weeks on seperate trips to Vegas.  \n\nThe first time, I was quite excited to go there as I have read all the reviews and I was certain I would enjoy the food.  When we got there, we were actually seated very quickly and our server brought our tea over very quickly.  After that, she seemed to ignore our table for 15 minutes until another server sent her over.  This really left a bad taste in my mouth and I ended up not ordering as much as I had planned to.  When the food came, everything was good.  The skewers were yummy and the honey toast is as everyone has reviewed.  A must-have!  On this experience alone, I would have only given Ichiza a 3 star.\n\nOn my second trip just last week, we had to wait a bit longer for the table but was seated at the sushi bar.  Our server was very prompt, courteous, and made great recommendations.  My co-worker and I were pretty beat up after walking around the convention center for CES.  This meal really hit the spot.  Every item that we ordered was superb.  I would definitely recommend that people order from the \""wall\"" instead of the standard menu.  The tapa-style food is definitely what sets this place apart from others. I now understand why people give this place 5 stars.  I would give it 5 star alone for the food but I will knock off one start for the mediocre service."
1;I made reservations for Mother's Day, and I've definitely had better brunches. The outdoor seating was nice, and it was not too packed when we got there at 11. As other reviews have stated, they were very clearly understaffed for Mother's Day brunch. Our service wasn't the worst I've had, but it left a lot to be desired. No apologies or recognition that it was pretty slow. My mom had to try 3 times to flag down a server to refill her coffee.\n\nI had the Mediterranean omelet with cheesy grits, and it was okay. I did not like the grits - not a lot of taste there. The mimosas were fine, nothing special. My dad said his omelet was okay, not great. My mom really enjoyed her Smoked Salmon omelet. Overall, nothing fantastic, especially considering the service. I wouldn't say that I refuse to go back, but I will seek out many other options before I try to come back here.
0;Overpriced, plain, simple burgers that took forever to arrive. The fries were fine, but also overpriced. This place seems to be a fad, lots of people waiting in line, presumably they, like us, also thought it was gonna be good. We had to wait an hour to be seated, we were expecting at least an average meal. Do not recommend.
2;Food is great!!!   They do however need more servers!!!  We waited long to order, get food and finally eat, then longer for the bill.
2;I was craving hainan chicken rice!! use my yelp mobile. And found this place!!  The dish came with a sweet soy sauce. The chicken was moist.  It came with flavored rice not bad but a bit on the drier side. Not bad average
1;What is the deal with CVS? They are consistently inconsistent. There are times I find what I need and get checked out in a reasonable amount of time. But for every one time that happens, the nine other times I cannot find what I want (or they are out of it) and the cashier seems to be moving at the speed of turtle. The only reason I keep going is the convenient location and the fact that occasionally they have amazing deals.
1;"This is my least favorite Cirque du Soleil show.  I have seen three other Las Vegas shows and three tent shows.  Ka, O and Mystere get five stars.  Corteo and Kooza also five stars, Ovo four stars. Yes, the music was great - of course.  But the whole show was disjointed - things were happening randomly and with no relation to the music; with the possible exception of Lucy in the Sky.  The acrobatics were relatively minor when compared to other Cirque du Soleil shows.  At time I closed my eyes so I could listen to the music and forget the chaos in front of me.   To be fair there were good moments: when a giant cloth sheet covered the stage and part of the audience; the roller skating acrobatics, the Lucy in the sky segment.  But the good segments did not work as a whole."
2;So glad that we found this place when we were undergoing a week long of continuous alcohol consumption in Vegas. Us girls were being obnoxious drunk bitches at 11am when we stepped into the restaurant, yet our lovely server treated us with much friendliness, even sitting herself at our table as we chit-chatted our way into placing our orders. \n\nWith her recommendation, I tried the corned beef hash with two eggs over easy. According to my memory under the influence, that corned beef hash was the best that I have ever had. With ample home-cured corned beef and perfectly cooked taters and eggs, I soon was under the spell of food coma. So, friends, come with an empty stomach, and prepare for a satisfying and reasonably priced breakfast in Vegas.
0;Ewww...these are the greasiest, heaviest donuts I've ever eaten.  The fillings were oozing everywhere and left a weird taste in my mouth.  I won't even let my dog eat them.  \n\nThese donuts can't hold a candle to Pink Box! They are the #1 donut in Vegas! And cheaper too!\n\nI'm sad....I had high hopes!
0;If it was possible, I would also give OnTrac negative stars. We placed a few different orders through Amazon to take advantage of the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. I didn't realize that Amazon Prime defaults to OnTrac for their two-day shipping.    We will be immediately canceling Prime. We live in San Jose.\n\nWe had two different shipments placed within the same order from Amazon and they were due to arrive on Wednesday and Friday--we didn't receive either package. When we tracked the package the site said 'In Transit'. I called OnTrac this morning and told the rep about the problem. She told me that one package was lost. Yes, they actually freakin' lost a package. It was a 43lb surround sound speaker set. Yeah, that's easy to lose. I was told the other package was delivered on Wednesday and signed by FD. This means they left it at the front door. Amazon is reshipping this item and will probably end up replacing the speaker set as well. \n\nWe are a little nervous about the other items we ordered today. They are Christmas presents for the kids and I have very little confidence we will actually receive them. Why on earth Amazon has a contract with OnTrac is beyond me. They are not reliable and make Amazon look really, really bad!
2;This is the best buffet outside of Vegas. I can see why the obesity rate is increasing every year with all you can eat food like this! They have a pretty good variety of food, all decent quality. People can be a bit pushy at times, but isn't that the charm of a buffet? I wear my hockey gear on steak night because NOBODY comes between me and my prime rib!
2;Front desk receptionist is a little abrasive. He should brush up on his customer service skills. The acupuncture was gentle, and took alot of pressure off of my neck. So far so good.
3;We have already been big fans of the burgers over at LGO, so it was no surprise to be impressed at Ingo with the same deliciousness. The set up is a little unusual with the order window towards the back of the venue, but I like the seating layout a lot. It's fun to sit outside and soak up some sun or lounge in the shade with a brew and some taters.\n\nThe food itself was fabulous. The crushed potatoes with labne were extremely tasty - even more so than I had imagined with the wonderfully distinct dip. I thought it was going to taste like any other sour cream or ranch dip, but it was something beautiful in its own right. I enjoyed the tuna burger - the burger itself was pretty good with plenty of avocado a soft spice. I added extra with their homemade fermented jalapeno sauce (totally awesome!). The buns were remarkable with just enough softness to not be mush when you bite. My companion tried the Ingo burger and reported the bun to be a slightly mushy with the saurkraut and mustard sauce dripping on it.\n\nThe service was friendly and timely. But the only reason I'm docking a star  is because they've removed the veggie burger. LGO's veggie burger has been my FAVORITE in the valley. I tried ordering it at LGO itself about a week prior to visiting Ingo and was told they no longer have it at the pizzeria, because it's on the Ingo menu. When I ask for it at Ingo, they've taken it off the menu... Do I want a rice bowl? F*&% no I don't want a rice bowl at a burger joint. Please bring my veggie back.
1;"Took the family out to this Islands for our Friday night dinner. A little back story I grew up in San Diego and went a few times to the Islands in Carmel Mountain  Ranch. The wifey lived in Rancho Bernardo for years and went to that particular location also. That place was almost always busy but we always got at least decent service. So now I was craving Islands and decided to check this location out. We live in Henderson so it's a good 30 minute drive. We walk in and the place is basically dead. I could see at least 6 vacant tables. The first worker sees us and walks over and says he'll be right back. A good 5 minutes later another guy comes over and say he'll be with us shortly. He walks to their little podium and starts writing. Then the phone rings and he motions with his hand another minute or so. So finally he seats us. Of course they put us in the noisy area next to some lady who can't shut the fuck up. It wouldn't bother me so much that she couldn't stop talking it was how loud she had to talk. My wife and I talked about how some places like to seat us with other families with kids. We agree it's a common practice.  It does take awhile for our server to get to us but finally we get the ball rolling. She orders the kids meals then we order our meals. We both want burgers but the odd thing is our server asks immediately \""Is medium okay\""? We're both cool with that since that's what we usually order anyway but found it odd that she was pushing the medium so hard. This is where it gets interesting but not really. We get the food in literally 2 minutes. I couldn't believe how fast we got our food. I've never gotten it that fast not even at a fast food restaurant. But when we started eating we realized how they were able to cook our food that fast. MY burger and the wifey's burger were basically raw. They barely seared the outside of the patties so it was all pink inside. After that we never saw our server again until after the meal. Oh by the way I was hit with a spray of Ranch dressing while I was eating my burger. A server at another table was clearing the table and dropped a full container of Ranch dressing. It shot everywhere but of course it only hit me. Got me in the shirt and the face. I was looking down so when I got hit it felt like someone spit in my face. I semi yelled \""WTF! who spit on me\""? Two servers came over and asked if I was okay. They kept asking me but that was it. So we finished our meal and we had finished our ice teas halfway through the meal but nobody ever came by to refill our drinks. We didnt see our server until she brought the check out. The whole time once we sat down we felt like they wanted us to eat fast and leave fast. We felt very rushed and we couldn't figure out why because for the time we were there the place didn't fill up. I would guess this is a management decision. Get them in and out as fast as you can. At least that's what it felt like. It sucks for the servers because they aren't gonna get any tips that way :) Just a theory of mine though. So make sure to order the burger the way you want it. The fries were good if you like crispy and don't expect to get a refill on your tea. We won't be going back to this location ever. We have a ton of burger places in our immediate area so theirs no reason to drive this far for mediocre service and food. Plus we hate leaving a restaurant parched."
2;You know...\n\nThe first time I went to this club, I was in awe. I remember entering through the front - it was dark and whatever just like any other club, walked up some steps, and turned to an AMAZINGLY open area. At first, I didn't know it was the pool so I thought it was soooooooo coool!\n\nThe club itself is nice. great layout. absolutely love that.\nOutdoor by the pool. plenty of places to sit for your sore feet.\nIt gets crowded though.\nmusic is weird. hmm, actually, music is BAD. \nThe novelty of this club definitely wore off the 2nd time and other times i've come.\n\ni would not want come to this club again when in vegas.... \n\nBUT, if you have never been here, DO CHECK IT OUT! For me, it was pretty breathtaking lol :D Make sure to enter through the front and not the back(which leads you directly to the pool area).
4;I've stopped by Yosi every time I've been in town! Every time they acknowledged me and helped me with all my needs. More than I can say from a few shops I've been to in Vegas. The juice bar is always changing which is great for experiencing new & different flavors.
4;What a fun show! The lyrics to all the familiar songs are hilarious. Men would enjoy the humor too! My mom loved the show as well. Even though my mom didn't entirely understand what they were saying, she was laughing the entire night. Their facial expressions and their dance moves are cute and funny.
1;The dining area is clean and neat, but I ordered a California burger and regretted it. The patty was tasteless and dripping with grease. And the bun the use is huge and tasteless. It was a good size burger you guessed it.... Tasteless. Try seasoning the meat and change bun. Service was good so not to totally bash them.. p.s., owner(I assume) don't just stand at register staring at everyone.... kinda wierd
0;When we first got here on a Monday at 5:30pm there was a long line at the front desk, looked like just 2-3 check-in people, needed to have more.  Have been here maybe 10 years ago, pretty disappointing.  Very crowded.  Went to the cafe for diner and there 10.99 prime rib special.  Not that great, and the smoky smell there and throughout the property ruined everything.  Good room price and location.  Room itself okay except for smoky smell again, even though we had a non smoking room.  Went to MAC king, just ok.  Front desk handed us free pass but you pay 10 for 1 drink min.  Long line so upgraded with extra 5 to get VIP line pass and half price coupon for.flavors buffet.  Show just ok, long line to get drinks.  Next morning went to buffet.  Generally not good.  Won't come back to harrahs again.
4;Always love this place. Friendly people and although parking can be a little tricky its no big deal. Alli took my hair from past my shoulders to a pixie cut and did a fantastic job! She always listens the exactly what I want and works with me until I'm perfectly happy.
3;Came here with a group of friends to try their drinks! For only $7, you can try 16 Coca Cola flavors from around the world! (2 trays worth!) Some of them are a hit and miss, whereas others are quite pleasant. My favorite is the apple-flavored Cola from China. There's one that tastes like Pina Colada and another that tastes just like Sprite from Korea. One of them tastes like mouthwash though!\n\nOverall, it's a great treat to stay away from the heat and have some refreshing drinks! There's multiple floors for you to look around for various Coca Cola merchandise. This is a great place to visit when you're in Vegas!
0;"I have to be completely honest... this is the worst Vegas show I have ever seen.  Not only did he use old, outdated material but when he laid on the floor while holding up his hand doing a \""Kermit the Frog\"" impression that was my cue to exit stage left.  My poor BF was such a huge fan and was really excited but he too could not even mutter a sympathy laugh for this guy.  Spent a total of $140 for two tickets and left a hot blackjack table to see this guy ... boo!\nBTW... this guy just became a headliner in Vegas even though he was on Mad TV ... we'll see how long that lasts!"
3;"So, until I became the hip East Ender that I am I thought it was the \""61 cent cafe\"" until one day, while strolling along Murray Avenue, I looked and saw the 61C bus dropping folks off right in front of the \""61 cent cafe\"".  It all came together - this local spot was named after the bus route that clogs Squirrel Hill! \n\nCash only here my friends - but reasonably priced coffee and lattes and fancy little pastries and snacks.  And it's cozy  here, small but not on top of the person next to you.  Such a breath of fresh air compared to the coffee chains out there.  \n\nIf it is nice out sit in their sweet little outdoor courtyard and enjoy the wildflowers (beautiful sunflowers sprout every year) and watch the bustle of the heart of Squirrel Hill."
3;AYCE .. cant beat it..
2;This place isn't the worst but not the best either.    The rooms are fairly updated and modern.   The walls are super thin, and the tall ceilings make any noise echo in the room, so it amplifies through the walls.\n\nBreakfast offered is a mediocre spread.   The waffle mix could be better.\n\nFree internet however, makes the star rating go up to 3 from 2.\n\nGood for football fans in town to see their team play the Cardinals.
0;"Don't go on a holiday weekend! \n\nLiterally from the time we stepped foot into the spa, my stress level increased.  From the 15 minute wait at reception to the 10 minute wait for the tour, I should have known that the spa was too busy to care about my mother and me.  There were SO MANY PEOPLE at this spa that there was literally nowhere to SIT, let alone lay down and relax.  For example, the pool.  My guess is there were about 18 chaise lounges by the pool and about 30+ guests.  Yes, I was one of the lucky ones who got to sit on the ground, waiting for someone to leave.  Just the sort of treatment you expect to get when you pay this much, right?  But to make matters worse, multiple couples saved a lounge chair for their spouse, while said spouse went to get their spa treatment.  For an hour.  Only for both of them to leave once the spouse returned.  So there were 3 - 5 open lounges at any given time  that were being \""reserved.\""  Out of 18.  Grrr.... I found these pool guests to be inconsiderate and entitled, which really rubbed me the wrong way.  \n\nI could go on and on because I was so infuriated with this spa, but I understand that this could have been an unusual turn of events (because of the holiday and the Travelzoo deal), so I'll leave all of the dirty details out.  Nevertheless, I saw a poorly run facility that was over-crowded, overwhelmed and ill-equipped to say the least.  Dirty towels everywhere, jam-packed jacuzzis, messy grounds, slow food/bev service.  Man, it was just a disaster.  We left early so we could sit down and have a drink.  \n\nThe one highlight of the day - which was the first thing we did - was our massage.  Both my mom and I were impressed with excellent massages.  My mom wouldn't stop talking about hers and was moved by her masseuse's care and concern.  My masseuse, Linda R., was highly skilled and had the strongest hands ever.  Both are at the top of their field.  \n\nBut alas, a great massage does not make a spa.  If you're looking for a high class, relaxing, full service spa, this is NOT the best choice in this area.  BTW, it might appear that I'm the only one rating this a 1-star, but if you click on \""filtered reviews\"" at the bottom of the reviews, you'll see 5 more disgruntled customers rating it the same..."
0;"I have really tried to like Suki Nails... I have. I have been a client on and off since they opened a few years back.  I live extremely close to the place and it's convenient.  Plus, I like to support local places near my house and community.  No longer can do so at Suki Nails.\n\n1. The owner is extremely rude.  To patrons, to employees and to kids.  There is no thank you's; there is no smiles.  She doesn't say hello or goodbye to patrons. If kids come in and do anything but sit quietly, she will reprimand them for you. I don't have kids but I have witnessed this several times. You will also notice obnoxious signs about keeping your kids in check are quite obvious. You're location is smack between a high school, middle school and elementary school, just outside of Blakeney and in Cedar Walk.  The area is chalked full with young families.\n\nThe way she speaks to employees is nothing short of degrading.  She doesn't care if you are there alone or with 15 people in the salon. It's terrible to witness.\n\n2. Expect to wait and wait a long time. Last week, I got there at 6:15 pm thinking that an hour and 15 minutes was more than enough time for gel polish change and eyebrow wax.... I walked out a few minutes after 8.  A mother and daughter were in that night and were waiting on pedicures.  They had their feet in the water and sat for at least 25 minutes before walking out. Who knows how long they sat there before I got there! Another woman came in for a gel polish change, like I, and got there at 5:30pm and left shortly before me.  Almost 2 1/2 hours! She had to remind someone to take her hands out of the foils. \n\n3. I type a lot for work and I had trouble keeping nail polish on for more than a few days before it chips, so I converted to gel nail polish (which is amazing by the way)!  But I've done this 4 times in a row at Suki and each time, there has been an issue with the application( from uneven coats to bubbling) which has been why I finally have had enough giving my money to this place.  Today, an entire strip of my nail polish peeled off after washing my  hands. I had my nails done less than 3 days ago! \n\n4. On the last night I was there; I got my eyebrows waxed.  Almost at 8pm.  The owner told her employee to hurry up and do so she could go home. (Glad I paid for that?) She quickly did my eyebrows and the next day, I had to get them re-done because not only were they uneven, she missed doing my upper arches. \n\nAlso, you save money for paying with cash.  Also, you can print coupons for discounts.\n\nThere IS a positives.. . It is very pretty inside. The nail techs are sweet and do a great job when they are able and not being berated. I hope they leave and go elsewhere!\n\nI will never return here.  Ever."
3;Haven't been in several years, and I was really surprised to see how the menu has grown and improved. I'll probably be coming back a few more times to try out all the things I didn't order. Friendly staff, and food quality that you'd expect from a chain.
2;Not bad pizza but not the best. It's pretty expensive which is understandable since this is the Las Vegas strip but if you need a late night slice of pie it will do the trick. If your looking for something to stand out or taste like a top notch pizza joint you may want to search around a little bit more.
4;Marcos the guy! I had received 3 or 4 quotes and everyone said the door had to be replaced since the parts for Amarr Stratford 1000 are not being manufactured anymore. The lowest quote was for $660 to replace 4 panels. Marcos straightened the damaged lower panel and installed a strengthening strut all in 90 minutes and for less than $300. Works fine and we're relieved and happy and satisfied!
2;"The Taco Bell on State St recently took the unusual step of closing for a month for renovations to incorporate a KFC into the same location. The new Taco Bell/KFC (or, as I've semi-affectionately dubbed it, \""Taco Cock\"") is a very different beast from the familiar old Taco Bell; they completely gutted the place and put in all new furniture and decor in a completely new arrangement, and repainted the white walls a sort of dark red. The chairs features a bell-shaped cut-out, and the walls are plastered with pictures of the Colonel. \n\nThis isn't two separate restaurants sharing seating space, either; there's just one counter to order at, and you can get any combination of burritos, tacos and fried chicken you want. My fiance and I usually order the half-pound beef & potato burrito at Taco Bell (cheap, filling, and about as close to healthy as you can get at a place like this), and on our most recent trip we supplemented it with an order of popcorn chicken with one of each dipping sauce (honey mustard, honey bbq, sweet & sour, and ranch -- all good, but we liked the honey mustard and ranch the best). The burritos were still the same as ever, and the chicken was surprisingly tasty -- so much so, in fact, that we went back for a second order.\n\nAdded bonus, \""Taco Cock\"" is open 'til 3am, so if it's late at night and you don't have enough cash for Qdoba, or you want a burrito but your SO has his/her heart set on artery-clogging chicken, this is the place to go."
4;My husband and I have been here at least 6 times and we addicted! The specialty drinks that they have are super. The antioxidant drink is my fav. We ALWAYS get the Hot Wings and Jalape\u00f1o poppers. They are incredibly unique and probably some of the best appetizers I've ever had. The Wings are your traditional hot buffalo wings and the other half are a mild wasabi flavor. I am NOT a wasabi fan...but this is just delicious! The poppers...oh the poppers! We seriously fight over who's gonna get the last one because they are so good! The Burgr's are delicious and have a Gordon Ramsey flare to them...super yum! My mouth is watering as I write this! They also have amazing milk shakes that are big enough to share! Definitely go here, you won't regret it!
1;Got the chef special rib eye. Came with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. Patrons were bland and soggy. No flavor. I ordered meat medium and it was med rare. Couldn't finish the potatoes. Green beans were dry and bland no flavor. Ordered a side of garlic fries, those were tasty. Beer was okay not too cold. Will not come back.
4;What can i say this place is fantastic! I can't wait to come back. So nice, designed so 60's ,very modern, beautiful!     Complimentary  valet parking! wonderful menu all sorts of great looking meals.   I got the mahi mahi sandwich with sweet potato fries.  My friends had a Burger and french dip along with Salad. Also an appetizer that was so large even 3 of us couldn't finish it.  We all had Tea and they made sure it was full throughout the lunch.   This place looks like it could be a lot of fun in the evening as well.    No wonder everyone has all good things to say about The Vig.   I cannot wait to come back.
1;I came here for the first time ever today to pick up a couple of cake pops as a surprise for my sweet pea.  While they had lots of cupcakes to choose from (no flavors really caught my eye), there were only four choices of cake pops.  One was mint, which I don't care for in deserts, and the others were brownie, cotton candy and a coconut which I got for myself.\n\nAll the cake pops had very thin coatings which cracked and flaked off before I even got them home.  The coconut had a nice moist center, very sweet (but that's the nature of a cake pop) and a sprinkling of coconut on the outside.  The brownie was gummy and overly dense and the cotton candy flavor was just disgusting.  \n\nThough Mind Over Batter is close by, I don't think we'll be trying them again.  Our search for a good cake pop continues.
4;one of my favorite restaurants for atmosphere.    great food, great service.....  love love love the pomegranate mojito!  Awesome happy hour.
3;A very popular breakfast spot in Queen Creek. Lots to choose from for breakfast & lunch. Good it's good &, the service too. This is my 2nd time here.
0;"What a disappointment!  Maybe I set my standards to high for this place.  The night we went, Asher Roth was going to be there.  Not a huge star in my eyes, but he's from my backyard so worth going to check out.\n\nWe did not wait long to get in, maybe 20 minutes, but talk about chaos!  There is a huge crowd, not a line, at the bottom of the escalator to go up to the club.  I just happened to find a hole and get up close enough to be seen and acknowledged.\n\nThe club itself is small.  It would appear bigger if 3/4 of it wasn't VIP tables for bottle service.\n\nHere is the \""I'll never go back to that joint again\"" factor.  I guess I'm too old to go out all night, drink and dance and then expect to be able to sit down someplace.  Not only can you not sit down on the plush seating in the entraceway, but you also can not lean up against anything without security telling you to move along.\n\nI think we were there for 2 hours total.  It wasn't worth it.  I should have stayed at the table in the casino."
4;I love this place, some of the best boba I've had. There's so many flavors (pineapple, watermelon, teas, slushes, smoothies, etc) that I've yet to have every flavor. I've never been disappointed with one yet :) The boba is good too. Some places have smaller boba, or they have an odd flavor. But I love the boba and popping pearls here. The prices are what make it five stars though. 3.50 for small, 3.90ish for medium, and 4.50 for large. And it's really a lot for your money. They have a points card too!
0;I have been to this particular location several times enough to know that the owner of the store was sitting in the lobby and greeted me. Everything was fine until I returned from lunch and notice that my tuna sandwich was toasted. I explained my situation several times until the owners wife got on the phone. I was very frustrated at the time, because I explained to them that I have been asked before if I would like my sandwich toasted. The owner's wife mention that none of her cashiers would ask that question. So as customer in my opinion the owner's wife did not think maybe it has happen or maybe this customer has had other orders with the purchases before or this is not a first time customer of our store to notice who is the owner. I enjoy the tuna from Firehouse Subs, but I will never frequent that store again, and will let co workers also know about the experience. As a store owner take some responsibility that it is possible this has happen when she has not been the store. The overall experience was great until I had to call about my toasted sandwich. I have never had an issue with any previous orders from this location. The subs are good, but the owner's wife is why they receive 1 star.
2;"As far as the food goes - it's overpriced and not notably delicious. The only thing I would order again is the soft pretzel fondue appetizer.  Everything else I tried or that my friends ordered was only mediocre, or less than mediocre. I ordered the shrimp caesar kale salad and was pretty disappointed. The salad itself was fine (although too much dressing) but the shrimp was those tiny popcorn breaded and fried shrimp (96% breading and 4% shrimp)- not what I expected in a salad. I would've much preferred a few normal-sized grilled shrimp, especially if I'm paying $13.  My friends ordered various antipasti, none of which seemed impressive. One of my friends ordered the sweet corn cannelloni which she didn't even finish because it was too sweet and the corn wasn't cooked enough.\n\nThe reason I am giving this place 3 stars instead of 2 is because the vibe is really cool. I like the little stage they have for live music and I think the \""yard\"" is awesome with all the different games to play. I'd be back to have a drink, order that fondue appetizer, and play games, but NOT for dinner."
3;Nice place...we waited 20 minutes to get seats! But the food was very good. The staff were so friendly...
2;"The goods:\n1. Better tasting than other places, such as RA or Sushi101.\n2. Nice decor--comfy and no thumping bass so you can hear each other.\n\nThe not-so-goods:\n1. They only had one roll on special, and it wasn't even a happy hour price; it is their \""recession priced roll.' A $5 Vegas roll is awesome, but I was hoping to see at least the basic Cali or Salmon rolls on the happy hour menu.\n2. Drink specials are limited; a few cocktails (like 3) and a few beer and sake choices (like 2).\n\n\nI'm thinking the restaurant size (being a small mom and pop type place) makes it difficult to have the wickedly cheap prices and  large variety I'm used to seeing. I'll go again."
3;Never had a disappointing meal here. Very good!
2;a typical family diner. lots of booth seating. great for breakfast but always special order or for some reason it doesn't come out hot!! the food is good, especially the stuffed french toast(a little small). service is always good-fast & friendly. the bacon is never crisp. however if you stick to the pancakes & french toast it's a real good meal for cheap. usually $10-$15 per person.\nthe ihop on the strip is good after midnite
4;Well, a long time ago I signed up on snap dragon's website  to be a hair model should they ever need one because I'm a student and on a budget at times. They called me months later because they needed a bob model, which I was totally down for. (it was free! :) \n\n I felt comfortable as soon as I walked in to this place. The decor is like eastern carved wood and naturey (is that a word?)\n   Stephen, one of their seasoned stylists cut my hair while Ana watched and followed on the other side of my head. \n  Ana is soooooo sweet! She has a great personality and is easy to have conversation with.  And Stephen was very entertaining and joked around alot, and you can tell he is very precise in his technique  :)\nThe cut was great and exactley what I asked for.\n\n  What a fabulous place! I love my lady who cuts my hair now at my usual salon , but am entertaining the idea of trying out Kandy for highlights because she was voted AZ's best colorist in ALLURE magazine.....
4;I LOVE THIS PLACE! I was looking for Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e--the dessert here on yelp, and the first thing that popped up was this place. Of course, I had to go and try the br\u00fbl\u00e9e burger, and it was AMAZING! I have gone about five times, and everything is soooo delish! It is a little hole in the wall burger place, that I sure did miss each time I would drive by. It is in a small shopping/center that consists of just a few establishments.\n\nEveryone is always super nice there, and I love the atmosphere! It is so laid back and they always have the best weekly specials! It is in my neighborhood, so this is my new burger place! \n\nIf you want to try a unique hamburger, I really recommend this place! I have recommended this place to about four friends so far, and they have all loved the place, and recommended more people!
3;Wondertum.
1;The food was ok at best.   Too much salt added to all the dishes we had.  I really liked the vegetable samosa.  The saag paneer was ok, but the matar paneer was horrible.  the chicken masala was ok as well.\n\nThe portions were pretty small for the price you pay.   The restaurant was big, service was slow, and it wasn't that busy either.\n\nI don't expect to eating here again.
0;"This is a writeup on the pharmacy department.  I called in early this morning around 10am to transfer a prescription.  I told the associate that I would be in around 3pm once she asked to pick it up.  I arrived today around 3pm.  I was told it would be twenty minutes.  Here starts the irritation.  I was on my hour lunch so I figured no biggie, I can grab lunch and bring it back to work.  It's now 345 and I'm told its finally ready.  This was not a big chemical mixture to work up either.  It's not alchemy 101.  It's for eye allergy drops.  What a concept, wrap the label around the box, bill my insurance drop in bag.  I present one of Fry's notorious $25 in free grocery coupons for transfering a prescription.  The pharmacy tech states that I can't use it.  I lose it at this point and ask why not.  She then reviews the coupon and starts looking through their book.  I looked at her and the pharmacist and simply state annoyingly \""It helps in these situations to read first before saying no.\""  The tech after scanning the $25 in free grocery credit asks me to pay and I ask her that I would like to know how much I owe before I pay.  She then told me the total.  I paid and walked away wondering how a pharmacy could staff such people.  Terrible.  I will not be coming here again anytime soon.  BTW-Fry's, I'll be transferring this script back to Target.  Time for service classes for your staff."
4;I am very reluctant to get my hair done because I never know exactly what to do with my hair, I never feel like I get my money's worth, and I never feel fully satisfied when I leave.  Today those feelings were put to rest.  My husband had had enough of me complaining about getting a haircut, so he did a little research on yelp and booked an appointment for me!  (How sweet!)\n\nWhen I arrived I was a little anxious and skeptical.  The place is situated in the same shopping center as Buffalo Exchange, which to me is a little sketchy to begin with...don't get me wrong, I have nothing against Buffalo Exchange...\n\nWhen I entered the shop, I was greeted by friendly people...all with the most cool dyed hair and styles and tattoos.  I have to admit that I felt a little out of place not being so punk and cool...but Jeremy made me feel at ease.  I felt like being around so much creativity in styles would be a good thing for me...and I was right!  Jeremy asked what I wanted and all I said was I wanted all my dead hair cut off and was pretty open to anything.  What I walked away with...2.5 hours later was a cut and color I absolutely love!  Jeremy has so much attention to detail and patience and an awesome eye for style.  I had no idea what I wanted but came out with a style I exactly wanted!  And all for under $100!\n\nNow...how do I style it on my own?  Will definitely go back for upkeep and possibly something new!
3;Another nice place for quality and reasonably priced dimsum.  By comparison, this place has a newer, smaller dining room than Orchids.  With their windows' orientation however, the air conditioning didn't quite keep up as well with the 106F heat.  OK, maybe it was only 102F at 10:30am.  The dimsum was good nonetheless.
1;Well, I gave it a shot...twice... before writing this review.  My co-worker mentioned seeing this place a while back and when I saw the Groupon, I decided I'd give it a try.  I got the cobb salad the first time and it was eh.  The second time I went I made my own chopped salad and they forgot the artichoke hearts and totally skimped on the turkey (which you pay extra for).  My salad was super overdressed and pretty soggy by the time I got back to my office (which is 2 blocks away).  The service is slow and there seems to be a lot of confusion behind the counter.  I understand that it hasn't been there more than a couple months but really...get your shit together.   A $10 salad isn't worth this nonsense!
4;Who complains when they have a belly full of Deluca's Pancakes??\nThis place rocks!! \nOn a recent trip back east, I was able to try this restaurant. We love trying and going to small diners that provide great food, large portions and a manageable prices.\nI had the warm apple pancakes....OMG....so so good.\nTry anything on the menu.....its all good!!\nDef new fav in the Strip District!
2;I'm a excellent at home cook and I bet I can come into this kitchen and create some of the same dishes. My minced chicken wraps are like 10 times better and egg flower soup is a special treat that I learned to make by watching her make egg flower soup. \n\nThe sushi on the menu was just average but it was kind of what I was looking for and the other chinese food was just a bonus. \n\nNow its not all bad the Dragon did come out on the steam shrimp bun like thing I had. It was the BOMB honestly. It had great flavor it wasn't doughy or fishy just simply shrimp goodness. \n\nThe real Dragon truly breathe fire in the noodles. I had a BBQ chicken chow mein kind of dish and it was  amazing! The BBQ sause was nice and spicy but not so spicy that it over powered the other ingredients like the shrimps. Who would have thought shrimps would taste so good in Las Vegas? Maybe they have shrimp in Hoover dam. \n\nI had a bunch of stuff for one person but it was good and not to bad on the pockets. I think i spent about $25 and I wasn't dissappointed so I would eat here again when I'm in Las Vegas next.
3;Came here after July First Friday. Dark, red, leather, stiff drinks, good drinks (skip the beer and read the drink legend), great nuts. I was there with a group and was pretty much left alone (which I like). The music was also real good.\n\nGreat place to lounge.
1;I was really excited when I found a Groupon for a local bakery.  I bake and love to see what local places are offering.  The store itself is really cute and welcoming.  The staff that I encountered were really helpful and willing to explain all of the different flavors that they were offering.  I was really excited share the cupcakes that I bought with my friends for my birthday.\n\nHere comes the disappointing part.  The flavors on these cupcakes were really nothing special in my opinion.  The german chocolate cupcake was really dry and had no flavor, same goes for the carrot cake.  The cream cheese frosting barely had any taste of cream cheese to it.  The latte cupcakes were completely overwhelmed with the bitter taste of espresso or coffee flavoring.  I'm a coffee fanatic and it just didn't sit right.  I was really looking forward to sampling the different flavors with my friends, but we were all left disappointed and feeling like something was missing from every cupcake.  Can't say that I will be returning to try more. :(
1;super divey, even lower than filbertos.... good for college kids that need late night munchies but my husband got sick off the fish tacos... i guess when you are desperate and its the closest thing to you besides burger king it ok...
0;Im not really sure what was going on here... It was so dark on the first dance floor and too bright on the second. I think the VIP area upstairs is tacky so all the 'high rollers' can stare down on you...very weird.\nCover was $20 Saturday after midnight, Why? Id rather dance in my room...\nWe went and hung out with the hotdog guy who was really nice. he hooked us up to get in for 1/2 price and said it was the most popular place to be in Vegas...Im not sure why. Although it was busy, it wasn't for me...\nThe Go-Go dancers....hummmmm... Yasmin G said it best in her review\n\nPros:\nThe hotdog cart accross the way\nThe drag queen named Chocolate\n\nCons: \nAll the rest.
1;I shop here often the selection can be some what lacking in the men's department. Beyond that this particular location continues to amazes me with there inability to remove security tags. I've been forced to drive back to the store twice in as many visits to have the security tags removed. PLUS the sales staff are all pushy and overbearing. After this last trip I'm returning everything I purchased, I'm tired of having to go back to the store just to have a tag removed considering how over my shoulder the staff was... Basically Dillard's you suck...
1;"Not what I expected especially after reading some decent reviews. A close friend of our recommended this place to us. We came in about 8:45pm they close dine in at 9:00pm The first thing that was said to us as they took our drink order is that they are closing at 9pm. Well that immediately creates the RUSH vibe. The last thing someone should say to you as you order is that their closing. \n\nWe quickly place our order, excited to see what all the fuss is about! As our food slowly came in we tried to quickly have dinner since we knew they would be closing. Not even 10 minutes into our meal my fianc\u00e9 takes a bite of his sweet and sour shrimp a pulls a long piece of hair out of his mouth. He was extremely upset, we sat there waiting for someone to help us no one was there. The lady at the front was on her phone as she sat at the register area. Finally I call over to her and she calls back to me across the restaurant. I didn't want to say what I needed to out loud but since it was hard for her to approach us I went ahead and said \""Well there is a piece of hair in our food!\"" She then quickly yelled in their language and a server approached us.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 was taking a photo of the hair cooked into the shrimp as the server snatched the plate while he was taking the photo. She then started yelling in their language took the plate back returned and said Sorry. She said she would bring in a new plate for us. They shortly replaced the plate for us and apologized again. By this time we lost our appetite and paid for the meal. NOTHING was compensated for the disgusting inconvenience of eating a piece of hair with our dish. \n\nI just wanted to get out of there. They obviously didn't know how to handle this situation correctly. I suggest for any future encounters they may come across to walk away from the desk when a complaint like this is made. I also suggest to do more then re cooking the plate that had been returned. We could clearly tell it wasn't a new plate. Another place off the list! NEVER AGAIN!"
4;This is my go to place, hands down best eyebrow place in Las Vegas! Sara is the best at making sure you love your eyebrows, if you don't she doesn't stop until they look amazing!they are so careful and tender with you, I love the vibe and atmosphere in here it's peaceful, clean , quiet with nice relaxing music.
2;1st time here. I got acrylics w/ glitter fill on my tips n uv coated gel topcoat. The quality that the lady did was great, however, it cost $60 excluding $tips. I would have expected acrylics to be less. I didn't see many 3d art samples at all n I would have been charged $10 more. No thank you to that part! Next time I'm going to More Than Nails, prices are reasonable for 3d art, glitter n flares etc.
3;Before I even arrived in Pittsburgh, I knew I was going to visit the Andy Warhol Museum. I mean, how could you not? I'm not even a huge fan of the man. Heck, I'm not even sure if I like his work. However, you cannot deny the impact he has had on pop culture, and for this reason, I knew I could not avoid checking this place out.\n\nThe museum itself is split between about seven floors, each with their own unifying theme. Surprisingly enough, it seemed like the museum housed a lot more of his film work than they did actual paintings. However, there is enough here of everything to keep you interested and walking through. In fact, there is enough here that I think you could justify a second trip just to be able to take it all in.\n\nMy biggest complaint about the Andy Warhol Museum is that it seemed pretty expensive to me. $20 for a ticket? Come on. Luckily the offer a student discount, and yes this will ask for an ID, making the price of admission $10 instead. In addition to this, the whole seven floors thing can be a bit deceiving, considering the basement is nothing more than a workshop and cafe, and the ground floor is taken up mostly by the lobby and gift shop.\n\nIf you have any interest in pop art or culture and you're in the 'Burgh, the Andy Warhol Museum is a can't miss attraction.
3;My friend is obsessed with this place, so it was quickly nominated for girls lunch. My first impression was that it was spacious and everyone was super friendly, I mean they open the door for you and are ready with recommendations. I immediately decided on the pick 2 combo, for the price it seemed like a bargain. The Asian BBQ sandwich sounded amazing and I heard the roasted cauliflower soup was fantastic, so I ordered it up. I love that you can see all of the ingredients, everything is so fresh and colorful, it really adds to the experience. We were pushed expeditiously through the line and found a table despite it being packed. I really enjoyed the Asian BBQ sandwich, it definitely had a kick to it but it had a good fresh flavor too. I instantly fell in love with the cauliflower soup, it was so creamy and rich, mmmmmm perfection! I like that they give you a piece of bread to dip in the soup, but it was overkill with my sandwich. I loved ending my meal with a chocolate covered strawberry, such a simple touch but a great way to end any meal. \n\nI was so impressed that I decided to go back that weekend with my husband. This time I tried the pulled pork sandwich and of course the cauliflower soup again. The pulled pork had honey mustard and cabbage on it. I don't normally enjoy honey mustard, but I thought all of the flavors worked well together. My husband had the clam chowder and the Italian sandwich. The clam chowder had a lot of black pepper in it, which wasn't my favorite, but he enjoyed it. The Italian sandwich, on the other hand, was great and I really enjoyed their homemade balsamic dressing.\n\nOverall, I think this is a really great lunch option. Everything is fresh and made to order. The customer service is fantastic, in fact when my husband and I were there they were giving away their daily customer service award to one of their team members - how cool! I can't wait to try some more soups and maybe even a salad next time. This is definitely a welcome addition to the Henderson scene.
4;Diamond in the rough. Fantastic food and exceptional service. We had dinner tonight and we will go back tomorrow for lunch:-) Thank you for the wonderful experience.
2;Stopped in here on a Friday night and was surprised to see that it wasn't that busy.  Our party of 4 was seated right away.\n\nWe started with some beers, chips and salsa, and some queso and chorizo dip.  All were good but pretty standard for a tex-mex restaurant.\n\nI got two tacos (Carnitas and Chorizo) and the street corn that people have raved about.\nCarnitas - I enjoyed the fruit elements (pineapple and mango).  They paired well with the pulled pork.  The crispy onions were an interesting topping.  While I enjoyed them, I'm not sure what they added to the taco.\nChorizo - Nothing not to like here.  This felt very traditional and was delicious.\nStreet Corn - Honestly, I didn't love it.  Cheese and sour cream on corn.  I was wanting the crema to have more flavor.  Garlic, salt, some chili perhaps.  Naturally, I ate it all so it wasn't terrible.\n\nOur server took really good care of us and was patient as we took forever to look over the menu.  The restaurant has a funky vibe inside and is basically split with the bar on one side, the kitchen in the middle, and restaurant seating on the other side.
4;Every Saturday morning I head over to Brambly Hedge and spend time helping take care of the bunnies.  BH is an amazing rescue dedicated to the well being of over 100 domestic house rabbits.\n\nAs Jack said, rabbits make wonderful pets.  They are warm, soft, clever and full of love!  Of course, I have a few favorites, but every bunny here has their own unique character and would love to go home with you!\n\nIf you are interested in adopting, check out www.bhrabbitrescue.org/ and drop by one of their adoption events.  You'll get to meet a hand-picked group of lovable buns and talk to professionals about any questions you my have.
0;impossible to get a list of ingredients for this place, no one at store has one, and the corporate office does not return calls or emails.  When the list of ingredients is not listed it is a major red flag and you have to wonder what is in the ingredients because it is not all natural like they state.  be weary of this place bad customer service stemming from corporate
1;The food is OK but I prefer Garcias.  The shredded beef on the tacos was bland and the beans had a weird taste. The queso was the best part of the meal but it was runny. Maybe they were having an off day but I don't intend to return.  On a side note, the apple crisp was great but that's not what I go to a mexican joint for.
2;"comfy in general!\n\nneed improvement:\n* Killer bathtub with off scale level to floor when step out!\n* Old '90 TV :(\n* Interior Noise level \"" LOUD\""  (  everytime plane comes & gone ) :O\n\n**** Parking FREE"
0;"Didn't have the best experience... really wanted to... people seemed nice and wanting to help but as I got into the program the \""support\"" i needed just wasn't there... pretty much \""follow the plan and it will work\""... but it didn't.  Started with Groupon super shot program - lost nothing.  Then went for the HCG... hungry all the time so they recommended an over the counter diet aid in addition.  Lost a bit of weight but then gained back :(  Just lost a lot of money :("
4;Loved it.  The staff is super helpful and the customer service is fantastic.  Had a lovely view of the strip, room service was fast, the pool was gorgeous.  The craps tables were hot.  Came in on Friday and stayed an extra day just couldn't bring myself to leave.\n\nThe pool area is awesome, rented a cabana for a half-day and hosted some friends that we officially love to travel with.  The service was spectacular, they prepared for us a couple of cold dishes and they had ice and soft drinks prepared.  We spent a wonderful afternoon there.\n\nIf you love to play, this is your place.  Olga the pit boss is fabulous, the crew at the craps tables were awesome, Ron the pit boss was great.  The team there appreciates your play.\n\nI cannot wait to go back.
3;This is a great spot for Vegas breakfast, which occurs around Noon, maybe 1pm. Coffee and some booze, a reasonably priced steak, and some delicious baked cheese.\n\nAlways a standard for our Vegas trips
3;Great food - very fast for takeout!\n\nThe family meal is a bargain - with plenty for a large family.  \n\nWe have eaten in a few times (not a lot of tables) and taken out many more.  The food is delicious and the service very prompt.  If you call in the order, it will be ready by the time you can get there.
4;I have never had an english muffin like theirs! Absolutely amazing.  The food is high quality and you can tell the difference.  The only problem is finding seating.
2;Pizza and wings are pretty good although a little over-priced.  Salad not so good.  Nice atmosphere and good service.
3;Always fun and good food.  We come here every year during NFR.  The only thing was this year the steaks were not as big and juicey as I remember.  Sorry.
0;"Haven't been to this place for a while but finally decided to eat here since this place is open 24/hrs. The host was friendly but after being seated we waited about 5min to have our waters served and another 10min for someone to take our orders.. The main person I was concerned about every time I come with friends is the guy that is always at the register. He is very rude and gives you a smug look every time we ask if we can split our checks. He never speaks to you and is always in a rush to get your money so you and your party can leave.. No \""have a good night\"" or a simple \""bye\"". Food was mediocre and unpleasant and found a piece of plastic wrap in my food. Never coming here again."
2;While I am not a frequent McDonalds customer, there are times when I absolutely, positively have to have the fries.  Nothing else will do.  When that need strikes this clean and newly renovated McDonalds location is A-OK!\n\nTwo drive-through lanes make ordering and receiving food quick and easy.  I fortunately have not had the experience of receiving an incorrect order, and have even been able to use coupons in the drive-through without issue.  \n\nWhile the food never quite looks as it appears on TV, I have not been to a McDonalds that does meet this standard (except in Tokyo, which made the most beautiful Big Mac I have ever seen... ) So, this will continue to be my go-to spot to satisfy my fry cravings.
2;Small, super clean, and the staff are exceptionally nice. I didn't think the cupcakes tasted good enough to justify $3.50, and even one kind I got (salted caramel) I threw out after a couple of bites because I just didn't like it. I don't buy in to the concept, but it's well executed and I can see why they're so successful.
4;Stopped in while on vacation in Arizona.  The food was delicious, service was excellent, and I loved the fact you could see into the kitchen.  You gotta love it when you leave a restaurant and wish you had one just like it in your own neighborhood.
1;"Thomas T. thinks Blue Ribbon is an \""absolutely world class\"" dining experience?! Yeah RIGHT. I went there this weekend for a birthday dinner with two other girls (quite a small group, especially for Vegas). Made a reservation for 9:30. Waited for forty-five minutes to be seated. Got seated at a weird boothy table that was way too big for three people and was positioned directly under what can only be described as an arctic chill blasting from a vent above us. Ordered the salmon tartare, spicy tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll, and a spicy crab roll. I'm not a sushi chef, but I can't imagine it takes that long to make that - yet it took almost a hour. The portions were TINY and way overpriced. The real cherry on top was our waitress, who was pretty much MIA the whole night, but decided to pop in after we ate and tell me that my friends had ordered a dessert for me ahead of time for my birthday. Thanks galpal! Maybe they have a different definition for surprise over at Blue Ribbon. The only redeeming thing was the dessert itself - the most rich, perfectly decadent without over doing it, melt in your mouth chocolate cake. Noms. \nMoral of the story: if you want to pay ridiculous amounts of money to eat tiny pieces of raw fish and get poor service, Blue Ribbon is for you! Seriously though, just go get that dessert."
2;My back passenger tire seemed to be losing air pressure about once a month, but I just kept putting air in it. On this morning, I discovered that it had finally given out and was completely flat. Arrived here and a super friendly guy, Justin came to my assistance. Kind of like the whole damsel in distress kind of thing. \n\nAnyway, we went outside to inspect the back passenger tire. He explained that there was a ring around the tire which meant that it had been going flat for a while and was starting to shread on the inside. It needed replacement no question. We inspected the other tires and found a nail in my front passenger tire. FML!! He also said that a patch would not fix the nail hole because it was on the side where the tread was thinner. Went inside, discussed pricing of the 2 new tires and suggested getting the warranty. Knowing my luck, I got the warranty on the new tires and my 2 older ones. Covers them completely for the life of the tire. Justin was friendly and answered all my questions since I know absolutely nothing about car stuff. I did not feel like he was trying to dupe me into anything. \n\nLess than 25 minutes later, out comes my baby with brand new shiny tires. Like I said, I'm not happy about the $500 I just spent. However, I am happy with the service I received here.\n\nSo why the drop to only 3 stars? As I drove away, the air pressure light came back on. Seriously? So I had to go to a different discount tire since I had already driven away. The guy at the second discount tire location found that my 2 front tires were over inflated, which is why the light came back on. He apologized for the mistake of the first location and said they should have checked everything before I left. This would have made me really upset, but the second location took care of me quickly and put me at ease.
2;I stayed at the Rio a couple of weeks ago and it was a decent experience. Maybe I'm just being harsh because I stayed at the Palazzo a couple months ago and nothing can compare. \n\nOn the positive side, the Rio was clean and check-in was prompt. They were also accommodating in bringing us extra blankets and towels. The pool area looked nice but we were there at the end of the season and only one of the resorts' pools was open. I could see it being a fun place to hang out in the summer.\n\nFor the negative side, it's a mile walk to the strip. There is a free shuttle that takes you to either Harrah's or Bally's but it only runs every 30 minutes or so until 12:30 a.m. The room was a decent size but being advertised as an all-suite hotel, I guess I expected more. \n\nOne thing that I found odd was the window from the shower to the bedroom. This would be fine with your significant other but when staying with a group of friends, it's a little strange and potentially awkward.
0;"Unforgettable experience - salty fries and burger to saggy. We order there supposedly famous ice cream in a big container but with no lead on it. We are family of 8 from California we feel that we mistreated. The location looks decent compares to other burger chain but may be becouse its new \""Hope will be Maintained \"""
2;Need more flavors and our malts came to us pretty much melted. The service was good. Old fashion pink atmosphere . Some arcade games with tokens/ tickets.
0;"This past weekend, I was in town for a convention that was at the Hard Rock, tho we weren't staying there. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I went to the Circle Bar and opened a tab while we waiting for the expo to start. Once it was time for us to start heading to the expo we told the bar tender we want to close out our tab. He then comes back and says \""we've lost your card\""- I'm dead serious. \n\nHe had charged/ given our card to a woman on the other side of the bar. Flag 1, he obviously didn't check the card as it was a mans name on the card. \n\nHe comes to us and says he will call security. So fianc\u00e9e calls our bank to cancel the card, for all we know she could try and use it. Bartender tells us there's no need to cancel he's going to walk through the casino and try and find her. \n\nSecurity comes and tells us they are going to look for her. Meanwhile we are now late for our convention and missing a speaker talk. \n\nBartender came back and said he can't find her. Security asked us to write down our information and they will call us. \n\nAbout an hour later the bartender comes into the expo and says he has our card. Well that's all fine and dandy- it's already been canceled so the card is useless to us, he then said that he would comp our drinks until 5 at the bar. \n\nNeedless to say that this was a huge headache. I understand accidents happen, but this is pretty bad. Obviously he wasnt paying attention, and when handling peoples credit cards he should have! Never staying here!"
2;Waiting in line for 1/2 an hr for cafeteria food is ridiculous \nI have tried to like this place but honestly very over rated \nThey could really decrease the wait time by opening another window and getting customers seated would be a huge plus!!\nYes it's a different experience but not a good one!\nI'm changing the 1 star rating to a 3 star only because we have been back here several times with people who insist and luckily we came on a tues at 8am so there are no lines! \nFood still okay at best but a 1 star may be unfair and I think 2 may be reserved for worse places also.\nI still will not be back at peak times to sit in long long lines
1;If you like grease and slow service, you'll like this place.  Was really hoping for something different when we arrived but it's typical bar type food you can get anywhere.  Onion rings that tasted like they had been frozen arrived on a bed of tasty french fries but were boredeline cold and greasy. We had to ask for something to dip them in.  My bbq sliders were good but because they had been left on the plate too long, they arrived luke warm with soggy bottoms.  The service could have been better considering the place was nearly empty and lots of staff in sight!
3;Vegan burger and fries with a vegan milkshake???  I want!!!\n\nThe Wynn has proven to be among one of the best places in Vegas for vegans to enjoy both fine and casual dining at one of its many restaurants, Terrace Point Cafe at the Wynn did not disappoint.  My first recommendation is to request outdoor seating on the patio, how relaxing!  Once seated, request the vegan menu if you're vegan, there are several options for you.  I began my meal with the most amazing appetizer I've had veganized in my life, the spinach artichoke dip - oh how I've missed this dip!  I would say that the dip alone is worth 5 stars and had I known how amazing it was I would have ordered two (and...um...possibly three...it's OK to be a little piggy on vacation, right???) in lieu of an entree.  Then came my much anticipated vegan burger, fries, and milkshake.  I think I mostly enjoyed the novelty of it more than anything, I mean it's pretty rare to get a vegan burger, fries, AND a milkshake anywhere - it even came in a box reminiscent of a fast-food meal.  But overall, I felt the burger was a little boring, it wouldn't hurt if they updated it as I'm sure one of their fancy-pants chefs could come up with something unique/interesting.  The milkshake was made with coconut milk and would have been better off having been made with soy or almond milk as the coconut flavor was overpowering.  So as far as the burger and fries, I don't regret ordering the entree as I enjoyed the novelty of it, however I wouldn't order it again unless they update the burger.  Overall we had a great time, great atmosphere, and pretty fantastic spinach and artichoke dip!
0;If I could give zero stars, I would. We waited for a LOOOOOONG time and were told we would have to wait another hour if we wanted to race. I should've know better when we showed up and a family was grumbling as they were walking out. Turns out the same thing happened to them. I can't comment on the carts because we decided we had spent enough of our vacation waiting so we left. I will say that the neighborhood is horrible and I wouldn't want my kids anywhere near there unsupervised. Save your money and spend it somewhere that knows what customer service is.
4;It was a pleasure to find a restaurant with great service, I decided that I will be a regular client. Thank you for the amazing food. I am on cloud nine.. \n\nHope everyone gives this place a try...you won't regret it
3;What is there to not love about hot, fresh pastries in a cute little bakery?! This place is the bomb!\n\nI recommend:\n-Ham and cheese croissant - this is a croissant with a thick slab of ham (not the cheap deli ham), cheese, and then more cheese sprinkled on top for $3.50\n-Quiche - any kind. They are all very good\n\nYou can easily get a hearty breakfast here for 2 people for $10. It's lovely to come here on a sunny day and people watch.
0;I went in for a cleaning and left with a TMJ stint that won't fit, a constant migraine, ringing with sharp pains in my ear, a mouth that can't bite or chew and crowns that feel like they were for someone else's mouth that still flaking cement & digging into my gums. The cleaning & initial x-rays went fine & were with staff I saw when I was there a year ago, however the dentist I had liked Dr. West was no longer there so I kept an open mind and gave Dr.Gomez & his assistant Mark a try with two crowns (one on each side of my upper back teeth) Here are a few of the things that went wrong:\n\nThey ignored my concerns as I addressed them including instructions I had from my TMJ doctor that said to use a bite block & allow for breaks, between 7:30am & about 1:00pm I got one break when I asked to use the wash room. \n\nMy husband also had an appointment for the same time and was left with no time estimate for my completion resulting in other missed appointments.\n\nThe assistant Mark paid no attention to what he was doing, having to be reminded to put gloves on, chatting with the dentist about what he did for New Year's, putting pressure on my face with the tools, stretching my mouth out to where I had to ask for vaseline for my lips several times which are cracked sore & peeling today.\n\nThe doctor had the water & the assistant had the suction leaving me with a sore throat from swallowing much of the cement.\n\nThe doctor didn't want me to leave until the bite was perfect but when I realized he was taking off from my perfectly fine bottom teeth to make his crowns work saying sometimes you have to do that and I just had to leave.\n\nDr. Gomez didn't seem to understand what TMJ was and that the stint was to realign my jaw & not my teeth and didn't get why I wouldn't let him adjust it to fit his work since the stint was so thick. \n\nHe said to come back so he could fix it but I just don't trust him & am hoping that there is another dentist at that office that can make it right before my TMJ appointment on Tuesday because I don't want to get my stints adjusted for dental work that still isn't right. When I was leaving I couldn't get anyone at the front desk to acknowledge me and was in too much pain to wait.
3;Love this place!  The people here are very friendly and more than happy to help. Plenty of samples on new foods.  I was impressed when the produce worker came up to is at checkout with a new type of apple.  He cut it fresh, provided us with background info, and offered us a sample.
0;Bleach. The salsa tastes like they opened a can of stewed tomatoes and threw in a pinch of parsley. The food was greasy (not fried) and left my stomach unhappy.  My plate looked like they just slopped the food on it.  The hostess was friendly and attentive unfortunately the waitress was one of the worst I have encountered. If you want good Americanized Mexican food, go to On The Border.
2;"Customer service was great,  the girl at the counter was very polite:) got 1 birthday surprise cupcake and it tasted \""okay\"" for 3.50. Cake was moist, just overall flavor was bland. Could of had the same taste from a safeway cupcake for cheaper."
3;Hell's Kitchen burger, part deux, and I was once again, not disappointed.  This time I ordered it medium well again, but this time it came out perfect.  I just freaking love this burger.  Roasted tomato, asadero cheese, avocado, delicious.\n\nThe truffle fries this time around we sub par.  Soggy fries are not my friend.  These are thick cut fries, so it's easy to see how they can end up being soggy, but this place should know how to do fries at the very least.  \n\nThe shakes here are interesting.  They are ginormous, so definitely think about sharing them.  They are also super sweet.  I know what you are thinking.  Me, the dessert whore that I am, thinking something is too sweet.  Well, take my word for it.  If you're not into super sweet desserts, you might want to pass on the shake.  The shake is milkshake on the bottom, pudding on the top, topped with whipped cream and garnished with a cookie.  I was 1/4 into it and had to stop.  It was just too much.\n\nOur server was fantastic.  Super efficient, really friendly, but not over the top.  We were seated at the same time as another group of friends, and we were done a good 15 minutes before them.  No, we didn't eat any faster, we just had better service.  \n\nDon't forget your Total Rewards card. You get $1 off each menu item just for being a member.  Not bad.
1;We got to this place at 2 PM yesterday (not exactly prime time for meals, so we expected it would be quick - or at least timely). Our waitress greeted us after a few minutes and took our drink orders. She then tended to a large table for the next 15-20 minutes. We didn't get to order food until my husband flagged her down at 2:27. It still took another 15 minutes or so before the food arrived (there were only 2 other tables at this point). A random beer was brought over by the bartender. Whole I'm not complaining about beer - it speaks to how unorganized this place is. The food is this place's saving grace. It was delicious. The service is lacking and needs some serious help if they hope to survive. They're surrounded by other restaurants that I would gladly choose next time knowing how disappointing the service is at cowbell. We'll give it another shot in hopes that it was an off day, but we won't be recommending it to anyone just yet.
2;Scot Rail itself is convenient and efficient, but the Waverly Train Station spot here is confusing because of all of the ongoing construction and awkward layout.  Go up to go down. Go left get right.  It's all upside down and inside out.\n\nThere are several trains coming in and out of this station within an hour and I found that Scot Rail's flexible tickets worked well with our day trip to Glasgow from Edinburgh.  The seats were comfy and the ride was smooth and quick.  It does get crowded, so be prepared for that.  Still, I think it's the best way to get from Edinburgh to Glasgow and back, even if getting on the train at Waverly Station will drive you batty to begin with.
0;"We had never had Mac and Cheese Sticks and were eager to try them, so we ordered them as an appetizer along with a beer for hubby and the Red Army cocktail for me. My cocktail was very sweet and I would not order it again. When we got the Mac and Cheese Sticks they were still VERY cold (I wonder if they freeze them and then drop them into the fryer....) We almost never send things back, but this was so bad we felt the kitchen needed to be aware, and when we told the server they were ice cold, I asked that she touch the center as proof. She said she believed us, because \""this had happened before.\"" She was quickly back with a second order and THEY were cold in the center! We sent them back and our server said we would not be charged for them (duh!) For our main course we had the BBQ Burger and Cheddar Burger, The meat was very high quality and we appreciated being able to order them medium and medium rare. The buns were good but guess what? The fries were not hot, probably because they sat on the pass while we tried to eat two separate orders of appetizers. Our server never came back to check on our order and we were sick of complaining, so we paid and left. This rating should be a negative star because food that this cold is a health hazard. Chef Kerry Simon needs to teach the chef about using thermometers before someone gets food poisoning. If I were Simon and I could not fix this cold mess I would get my name off of it. The next day we went to the Rain Forrest Cafe which is a tourist trap and for which I had zero expectations -  however, the burger and fries were better than KGB."
4;Good food at reasonable prices with xlnt service.  I wanted to eat here\nafter  reading all the good reviews online and was not disappointed.\nWickenburg was always a rest stop before the completion of I-10.\nWith all the construction on I-10, a leisurely drive along Hwy 60 with a\nstop at the Horseshoe Cafe would brighten your day.\n\nSam Pinterpe\nHuntington Beach, CA
1;Just spend 20 minutes on the phone waiting for someone to answer, called both numbers, regular and toll-free and yet I couldn't  talk to anybody, I just wanted to make an appointment for a flotation bath.....If this is a foretaste of things to come then I don't want to think what it'll be like when I am actually there
2;"Do you know how much they charge on the Strip for a spa pedicure?  Over fiddy bones at most places.  I had a car and I was not going to get sucked into the tourist trap, so I yelped, found this place and called for the prices.  Spa pedicure costs $23 and they open at 9:30 a.m.  and yes, they take walk-ins.  SOLD!\n\nThe location appears to be in the heart of Chinatown.  The shop is in a strip mall and it was in full swing when I arrived.  The lady was good at giving my feet a real good scrub, but mediocre in the massage department.  The chairs were very relaxing with all the typical massage bells and whistles for your neck and back.  \n\nBut by day 2, the polish was chipping.  Not cool.  Normally, pedicures can last a pretty long time.  I had to dock stars because of it.\n\nStill, if you are in need of a pedicure (and I do mean \""in need\""), venture off the Strip and come here.  Pick up some noodles while you are in the neighborhood too."
0;"I live within a half mile of this yoga studio and decided to try a few sessions out with my aunt. We both purchased $40 groupons for ten hot yoga sessions at this location. On 11/11/14, we went in to sign up and get started but were treated with absolute disrespect by the man working behind the counter. I couldn't get my groupon voucher to cooperate on my phone and he stood there peering over my shoulder and treating me like I probably didn't have the groupon. He asked me if I had been there before and I said yes, it has been over 3 years and before I could even finish my sentence he cut me off and said \""Groupons are for new customers only, it says so in the fine print!\"" I was taken aback by his snappiness and it showed on my face. He looked at me and said \""Wow\"" in the most scrutinizing and arrogant tone. Wow, talk about an unwelcome feeling! I knew immediately I didn't care what that bikram yoga studio had to offer because I would not dedicate my business to an establishment that could make a person feel so unwelcome. They must have enough money that they don't need any more business at all! I walked out and went right home to have my groupon refunded immediately. Apparently, they told my aunt that if I would have come back they could have used my groupon towards a package but since I felt the environment was so hostile, I had no desire to spend any more money there. That gentleman should really work on his customer service skills and how to communicate with people because he turned down two customers yesterday. We both had our groupons refunded and will never recommend this place to anyone. We are going to check out TruFusion Yoga next week!"
2;"I used to enjoy this for lunch on occasion - Sorry to say it CLOSED a couple months ago... I think \""Julio's Too\"" is still open."
1;"Went in with a free threading. Krystal came with one word: \""Hello\"". Looks like she's a very quite person, or maybe she's just pissed off. So I tried to be more friendlier by greeting her good morning and how are you doing? She just went straight to the chair and told me have a sit. Omg! I had tears in my eyes. Not sure if she's threading 5 hairs at a time! !! She heard me quite a few times \""ouch\"", but she just kept quite and kept going. Even after that, I still gave her a generous tip. I think she's not happy that I got a free threading from the President. Got home and saw that my eyebrows are not even. I think I'll go back shaving and shaping it myself."
4;.... on Friday evening place looked like a kind of students, young professional's pub which is nice surprise in the middle of Leithwalk. \n... inside: comfy seats, lots of space, 4 screens if you fancy for movie with subtitles and good selection of drinks. \ndefinitely Im going to visit this place soon...
1;"My group of friends decided to try out Eve at the City Center on a Friday night. We thought that it would be nice to try something new, and the reviews were decent.....better than Haze. \n\nLet me tell you, I was very disappointed. The highlight of the venue, was its large crystal chandelier, a ring of screen projectors above the dance floor, and a cool hollow light frame next to the girls bathroom. The venue itself is quite small. If I had to compare it to another Vegas venue, I would probably compare it to Lavo, but I would still choose Lavo over Eve any day. \n\nIt was a very mixed crowd. We got to Eve around 12:30 AM, and it still wasn't the energy I expected. My group and I stayed for less than an hour, trying to drink enough to turn the club \""fun\"" for us. However, we failed and we all agreed to go to Tao, even though we swore that we would not go to Tao again for the 234098234th time.  I'd have to say, Tao saved the night."
4;Great Place to eat.  Actually one of the Best pulled pork sandwiches I have ever eaten.  My buddy had the pork burrito and said it was incredible.  The staff is friendly and the business is extremely clean.  I highly recommend Pork on a Fork.
1;Wir waren vor ein paar Tagen im 5 Sterne Chinarestaurant und haben beide eine Mittagsmen\u00fc bestellt. Leider hat es uns beiden nicht geschmeckt. Auch waren die Bedienungen nicht wirklich freundlich.\n\n\n Als wir letzten Sommer einmal abends dort waren, hat es uns wesentlich besser geschmeckt.
0;Please don't stay here - this place is not worth risking your health!  Aria currently claims the bacteria that causes Legionnaires' disease is contained, but they do not know for sure.  Aria has not and WILL NOT be testing all the rooms for the bacteria.  \n\nMy friends and I booked several rooms for next weekend.  After we learned of the outbreak, we called Aria to get additional information.   They could not care less and quoted from some script about how no additional bacteria had been detected.  And though we planned to cancel, we still asked if there would be discounted rates considering the health risks - an emphatic NO.  So really no compelling reason to stay at the Aria - in addition to the risk of Legionnaires' which in itself is a dealbreaker, there are no notable restaurants, clubs or pool area here - - Buh-bye!
2;For an upscale Vegas hotel, the rooms were...surprising not that exciting. We got some average-priced hotel rooms with the slant, but the elevator ride up was a nightmare (each elevator was a bit shaky, or noisy, or made sounds) and while the pyramid soap was interesting, the lack of wifi in the room wasn't that great.\nThe main casino floor was nice - semi-easy to get lost in, if you weren't paying attention, but easy enough to navigate after a bit. The pool was nice, but a lot of the stuff is expensive.\nOtherwise, it was ok. Not the best, but it was ok.
1;Their interpretation of mac and cheese was bland and greasy, kind of gross.  The short rib entree was ok.  This seems like one of those restaurants where the food doesn't seem to live up to the wonderful descriptions on the menu. \n\nIt's a nice concept and I agree with a previous reviewer that the lack of TVs is refreshing.  I hope that's a trend that catches on with more restaurants.  Hopefully they can get the kinks out.
1;"Here's the thing.  You're a \""celebrity chef.\""  You're on TV and are brought in to judge cooking shows.  Maybe it's me but the food at your restaurant is YOUR FOOD.  Your name's on it.  Maybe you didn't cook it, but you sure as hell own it.  The food here is better than okay, to be sure, but maybe only as good as not bad.  Definitely not amazing, mind blowing or any of that good stuff.  We had the halibut, among other things that were much better, but that halibut was pretty bad.  That just shouldn't happen in a restaurant like this.  For the price and considering Keller's rep... it should just be better than it is.\n\nLOVED the onion soup shots.  Those were definitely out of this world."
3;Oh my God...Oh my God...I feel the heart attack coming...Ahhhh....and it is so worth it!! \n\nThis place has all of the tasty, greasy goodness one needs to complete a day, or week, or month for that matter. The Fry bread is made fresh and you can most certainly taste it. Again, it is definitely greasy, so if you are on a health trip, you may want to avoid this place. For the rest of us, who indulge, this is worth every pound. \n\nThe meat was cooked perfectly. The sour cream was abundantly present. The cheese was in all the right places (everywhere). And the fry bread was greasy, crunchy, and light all at the same time. Not sure how they pull it off, but they do. \n\nI would suggest to go there for lunch for the following reasons: \n\n-a wonderful break from work \n-leaves you in a food coma, meaning that the rest of work with fly by \n-it gives you the rest of the day to work the grease off \n-just makes the day better!
2;Had bacon burger. Sat at the bar, which even though place was empty, was an error. Slow, slow service. \nBurger was tasty enough, but as with similar places, bun fails to maintain integrity & becomes soggy & falls apart. Yet, I still ate it, all.\nLots of non-bar seating, yet unsure how smokey it gets so unsure would bring family.
1;You'd think a place called Hot Dog Stop would serve a great Chicago-Style hot dog.\n\nYou'd also think they'd have snappy Sabrett hot dogs, since hey, they have 4 Sabrett umbrellas outside.\n\nLeave your assumptions at the door, since neither of the above is true.  My Chicago Dog was the following:  A skinless hot dog, inside a mexican-style bolillo roll, with chopped tomato, jalapenos, sport peppers, electric green relish, mustard, onions, and a pickle spear on the side.  \n\nC'mon guys, at least try to make it look like the real thing.  Give me a poppy seed roll, put the pickle on the dog, give me a natural casing dog, no jalapenos.  Sliced tomato please.  Sport pepper and relish were fine.  \n\nThe owner(?) was energetic, almost slightly offensive.  Tone it down slightly dude.  Customers are uncomfortable when you comment on their perceived hunger based on your judging their body size - even guys.      \n\nThe condiment bar was well stocked, but canned mushrooms?  Yuck.  \n\nAlso very expensive for what you're getting.  I paid $10 for a dog, fries and a drink.  On a positive note, their fries were really good, albeit a little too salty, but really hot and crunchy.\n\nI hope they can get it together, and other hot dogs looked good.
3;The Chipotle for salads. Every salad topping you can imagine, and there is no limit... Plus, they have kale & homemade dressings. Love how they chop everything up small & mix it up. Simple, genius, and healthy.
2;I found this place quite by accident. I went to Tanzy and this is right next door. I didn't realize that is it a whole concept and they are related. Salt, iPic and Tanzy. As a treat for my husband's birthday I got 2 premium plus seats. When we got to the theater the server gave us newbies the rundown. She said popcorn would be served all through out the movie....all they gave us was one bag.  A little bag. So I agree with the other reviewer that said you need a button to push for service because you pay enough to get more than one bag of popcorn. And a disappearing server...
3;Came here to see the BoA 500.  We had some really good tix, the Hot passes.  Got to see all of the cars up close, see some drivers, go into the garage, etc.  I didn't pay for the tix, and am not sure how much it was...but it was awesome.\n\nThose cars are insane!  To be so close was a treat.  Then walking on pit row, walking on the track...that was a great experience.  The drivers are so nice, it is like they're nothing special!  Weird!  \n\nStood behind pit row during the race...those cars are fast and LOUD.  It gives so much more to the race - I'm not even a fan.  Glad I came though.
3;This airport is great!  Yes, it's small and can be a little bit pricier to fly out of but you can't beat the fact that there are never any lines.  I am notorious for cutting it close at airports and this airport allows me to get in through security sometimes in less than 10 minutes.  There aren't a lot of food options but what they have isn't bad.  If I want to be picky I guess I have noticed that the TSA staff here aren't really that friendly but it's an airport so I guess what can one really expect.  All in all though, I try to fly out of here as often as I can because come on, ten minutes through security?  You really can't beat that!
3;We've been to some great aquariums in New Orleans (pre-Katrina) and San Antonio, and this one at Mandalay Bay is right up there. The shark exhibit is the highlight. We also enjoyed the Komodo dragon and the jellyfish. Lots of funs for kids of all ages. Don't forget to turn off your flash so the pictures turn out.
2;The lunch specials here are pretty great , which is awesome since I work less than 5 minutes away!  The service has always been good also, even during the lunchtime rush.\n\nPrices are average and the fish quality is far superior to any other sushi place that I've been to in Mesa.  The inside is a bit small, but luckily this spot is still a bit of an undiscovered treasure so it's never too crowded.
1;Stopped in for bite to eat, first off its like a maze to get in the place, I find the entrance, there is a check out there, one small fuzzy computer montior, and a regular size tv. I see no menu board, and grab a menu. I order a hot dog and fries, total cost 3.98. Ill be honest, the place looked on the dirtier side, I wait for ahile, maybe close to 20 minutes, well the fries, where on the under cooked side, and the hotdog, was ahhhh. Tasted like an oscar myer.  Over all I can't. Say any thing other then what I had, I'm sure if I was a kid under 12, I would love it.
0;Very high prices, you can find prices 10 - 30% less online with free shipping and zero sales tax!  I cannot understand why anyone buys at these high price retailers unless they want to give away their money and charity would be a better cause helping homeless animals!\n\nWayne Gorsek
3;I wanted to find out how close DeMarco was to DIFara in Brooklyn. If it was in NY, no one would confuse the two. If you are in Las Vegas it may work. I did like it because it was a good stab at real NY Pizza but the crust was missing something significant....first it lacked the gutenous stretchability, second it failed to take on a nice caramelization, and third it was 2X the thickness of a real NY pizza.  The cheese was reasonably stringy, the sauce was very good with a great tomato essence but a bit of saltiness. So I still gave it 4 stars...in NY I might have only given it 3, but I suspect in LV no one is nearly as good. Wine prices were a bit high but not bad.
0;Update: came here for lunch with a group of 6. Ordered and still waiting for our food after an hour. Waitress was not polite at all.
1;"Hmmmm... got a message from a manager/owner of Aunt Chiladas regarding my review. Still not sure how I feel about it.\n\nShe informed me of the new vegan/vegetarian options on their menu and told me which items contained animal products. Helpful. I guess... \n\nBut then she said their refried beans are made with bacon which is \""traditional in Mexican cooking.\"" Maybe traditional in YOUR family. Keep in mind my mother is Mexican. She said growing up her mother would refry beans in lard. But bacon? Nope. Bacon was a luxury. And after several members of the family became vegetarian my grandmother and other family members still made some pretty damn good beans and tortillas, lard-free. \n\nShe then went on to say that the menu chosen by my high school reunion committee was not a menu I would have chosen for myself if I would have known the other options. Sigh. I have been a vegetarian my whole life. When I see a Mexican buffet, I can usually count on chips, salsa, beans, and rice. But the waiter who yelled at me said EVERYTHING had a meat product in it. And this was way before their \""new\"" menu came out with vegetarian options, including vegetarian black beans. \n\nHer apology was half-a**ed. She apologized for my \""experience\"".  She didn't even apologize for the unbelievably rude and mean behavior of the server who yelled at me for asking about vegetarian items.\n\nAnd one more thing I forgot to throw in my previous review. At my reunion, the bartender they had in the banquet room was awful. A rude, angry bitter old man. Just warning anyone who might have an event here. Luckily the party moved to the main bar and the staff there is awesome. See? I give credit where it is due..."
1;The only good thing about this place is the strawberry hotcakes.  Here's the thing: the combination of sliced fresh strawberries, sour cream, and brown sugar is sheer genius.  I'll give them that.  But you can do the very same thing AT HOME.  And you can do it without waiting outside in the heat/rain/snow for 20+ minutes, having to have cash on hand, eating your meal sitting practically on a stranger's lap, or wondering what the strange sticky substance on the table is.  Oh, hey, and you can even brew a decent cup of coffee while you're at it.
2;Food was great, feels like home cooking.\nJian Bing was a bit bland and oily.
3;Decided to veer from our typical breakfast burrito spot and try something new this morning. I must say, this was one tasty breakfast burrito! My hubby and I both had a bacon, potato and egg burrito which came with beans on it as well. I wasn't too sure about the refried beans, but it added a nice texture and another level of flavor along with the perfectly spiced hot sauce. The potatoes were basically French fries, which in my opinion made it especially sinful...god I wish they were open late night for that vodka fueled burrito fix! All and all, we both inhaled our breakfast and vowed to return for more next weekend :)
0;Where do I even begin with this nightmare of an experience? My wife and I like to try new places so we use various sites like yelp and restaurants.com to get reviews and deals in places we don't usually eat at. I checked restaurants.com and saw a deal close to the house for this place...I've driven passed bomas about 900 times and never even gave it a thought. It's always seemed like a crappy neighborhood bar and there's never anyone there. I said why not, it's probably slow and I can get in and out. I called and tried to order off what I thought was their menu...it was linked to their website and restaurants.com so I didn't think anything of it. The lady in the phone said everything I tried to order was on their old menu and they didn't have it anymore. I told her id look again and call back. I found another menu link on their website, called back, and gave it another chance. This time yet again they didn't carry those items again...it was only a sampler and a sandwich!! And they didn't have it. So I just ordered the most basic bar food I could think of, fingers and a steak sandwich. She told me they don't make a steak sandwich anymore, but she can ask the kitchen. She said it would be ready in 15 mins. I get there and there's maybe 8 cars there...it's Friday night at 8pm. There's people dealing drug's in the parking lot.. this is by Rhoads ranch btw...so that has to tell you how much of a drag this place is. When you walk in there's a restaurant side and a bar side. I sit in the restaurant side since I ordered food and there's only 5 people there at two tables. I waited for 10 mins before someone came out of the back to tell me they couldn't help me and I had to go to the bar. I go to the bar and waited for 10 mins until the bartender came and asked me what I wanted ..there were only 4 people there! I said in here for a pick up..she told me ok and had the guy from the restaurant side bring over my food. She comes over with the bill and I hand her my card and the certificate..she tells me that I can't use it for take out. Now just to make this clear, I read the certificate all the way through including the fine print and it does not say that anywhere in there. I didn't argue because I'm not a crazy cheap bastard....plus I can just exchange it on the site I got out from which is a great feature. I paid and left...I even tipped. Now the moral to my story is..this is las Vegas, I live in the south west ..there are about 150 places around my house I would gladly of paid full price for..this crappy little bar with poor customer service and even worse food is not one of them...and I would urge you not to as well.  The steak sandwich was gross and was over cooked beef slapped on a roll. The chips were little grease bowls and the sweet potato tots were soggy. I will give credit where it's due though..if you do deal with this crappy little bar try the chicken fingers. They were the only saving grace.
1;"I want to preface this by saying that I have been coming here since 2005, since my college days of clubbing or bar hopping with the girls in Vegas.  Heck, we even came here last year when I attended one of my good friend's bachelorette party in Vegas.  I always order their $7.77 special.\n\nThus, I am taken aback by our most recent trip here in January of this year. I came with my fiance, and my family. I wanted to show them what I knew about cheap eats in Vegas. It was their first time there, and Honestly I left feeling empty and disappointed. First of all, they wouldn't let us sit at the table that we wanted to (due to special restrictions), and second of all, they took almost 15 minutes to get to us. The first time, the manager came by to tell us, \""I don't know who will be serving you.\""  Finally, after 15 mins, the same annoying manager comes over and tells us that \""she'll be the one serving us.\"" She asked me what we wanted. I said six waters to start and six orders of the $7.77 special. She made the most disgusted look (of disdain/or did she just smell some stinky fish?), and proceeded to give me attitude for ordering this many specials.\n\nCome on WOMAN, you really think I'll come here for your other dishes? They're annoyingly overpriced and no I would never step foot into Hard Rock had it not been this special - theres absolutely NOTHING special about the Hard Rock or the ambience. Just a bunch of Bros/and white trash walking around, and at this point I can vouch for you that the manager is no different from the said demographic. Sorry to state the truth. Can't handle it? Well, too bad.\n\nAnyway- so she gives us this major attitude and stomps off. Who knows, she may have even spit in my water, but I thoroughly examined it to see if there were floating loogies (sp?) and low and behold, NONE! Ok anyway, so after the food comes out/and we're eating, she basically asks us in the most \""fake\"" tone...how is the food going? But was really short on us.\n\nHonestly I just wanted her to go away. Her attitude was UNCALLED for and unprofessional. She made my family (who-for them it was their first time) feel uncomfortable. It also showed that she judged us for ordering this meal just because it was cheap. So what? It doesn't matter how much our meal is, $5 or $500, we should still be treated nice and like human beings. That's what Tip is for.  And that, my friend, is why we only tipped $.25 cents. Hahha.....bwahhaa I hope she realizes her downfalls. Bitch!"
1;Unbelievably Slow Service! \n \nPumpkin Martini was awesome but the food was mediocre. Wait - staff friendly but very, very S L O W and unattentive. Would not return.
3;Awesome deal for the 'all you can eat' with much better variety of nigiri choices compared to other all you can eat sushi joints in the area. Seafood quality has been superb 99% of the time. I was served some uni once that tasted awful. I mentioned it to the server yet I was still charged and no apology was given. \n\nThis would be five stars but for the uni experience, and also on occasion, the rice amounts increase (with a corresponding decrease of the seafood portion) when doing all you can eat and ordering A LOT of food.
4;The service was good and the food came out very soon after we ordered. The menu is extensive and has many different options of Thai and Chinese dishes. The menu offers anything from soup to noodle dishes to stir fry. I ordered their spicy soup with shrimp and it was very good and actually spicy and had a lot of veggies in it. The restaurant itself is but small but went during the week and it wasn't crowded at all! I would definitely eat here again and it's very close to the arena!
1;I have been to the sushi side of island sushi quite a few times and it is decent sushi, not great but decent. The only time I go there is during happy hour when stuff is 50% off. If you want great sushi go to Yama Sushi.\n\nAs for the grill side, the food is horrible. I had the Kalbi ribs and the teriyaki chicken. The Kalbi ribs tasted like old meat... it was gross. The teriyaki chicken had no teriyaki flavor whatsoever and it did not even come with teriyaki sauce. Also, the macaroni salad was the worst Hawaiian mac salad I have ever tasted. It was extremely bland. The food was so horrible it seemed as if it was prepared this way on purpose to keep people away. I just don't see how they could make the food so bad!\n\nIf you want good Hawaiian food go to Aloha Kitchen. I have tried tons of other Hawaiian joints and I keep going back to Aloha.\n\nAs for the service, it is decent. It does seem as if the service is steadily declining though.
4;My 7-Eleven when Im in Vegas! And when I used to live here!\n\nIts always clean and the staff are friendly! \n\nNachos and Slurpees.... mMm...
4;We've been here four times now and absolutely love it! The veggie mushroom hash with tomato hollandaise is my personal favorite. Hands down the best breakfast place I've eaten at.
1;"I really do not like the name so maybe that affected my opinion a little bit. I sat at the bar and the staff was great. I ordered the fries off of the Happy Hour menu and they really sucked. Not much to base my opinion on but really; do not put it on the menu unless you are going to do it well. The only thing that saved these so called fries was that I used the salsa to cover them. They were in no way shape or form crispy so the salsa did not make them soggy. The salsa was good."
2;We go to Margaritaville numerous times a year and have a great time.  We take visitors to it.  Last night was not as great as usual.  The Host staff was having a bad day and did not want to be at work.  We had 7 in the group and it took 40 minutes to get seated at 2 round tables.  They seat several groups of 5 & 6  before us (they came in after us)  They could have seated us right away if they planned to give us 2 tables.  We could not talk with the other table and it made it tough to share nachos.  Food was great and Jeff our server was awesome!  He made up fro the poor host staff. \nNot sure I will take friends to Margaritaville for a while.  We would have stayed longer and spent more but we went somewhere else so we could seat together.
0;How do you run out of pineapple? How do you wait 20 minutes to contact us and tell us you have no pineapple when your 'tracker' told us it was in the oven. And to top it off you offer nothing in return for wasting my time? Point taken! Give me my refund. And how about you go find some pineapple!
3;Good lunch spot offering burgers and sandwiches.  I tried the pulled chicken sandwich with fried and it was tasty.  Served on a fresh roll with cole slaw and BBQ sauce, it really hit the spot.  The generous portion of fries was a nice surprise.\n\nReading the menu they only use fresh and primarily local ingredients and it shows in the food.  I'll be returning next time I'm in town.
0;Have been here several times hoping it would improve-but sadly not. Bad service, dirty(bugs in dirty liquid by my table) So so food-- Too loud music doesnt make for a relaxing breakfast!
4;Just moved from Indiana and wanted to find out what all this hub-ub was about with this burger joint called in-n-out. DIDN'T know what I was missing. Best burger that wasn't $30 that I have ever had!
3;Love this place! The service is exceptional, and the sandwiches are fully customizable and tasty. I go around lunch time, and it is always crowded. Order online ahead of time or prepare yourself to wait. There was one instance where I arrived around lunch time and the place was packed. I placed my order and did not want to wait inside because there were so many people and little children running around. I let the cashier know I would be waiting outside. I waited for a while outside and a crew member came out and asked if I was waiting for a sandwich. I told him yes, and let him know my name and he brought it to me. The cashier is super busy so I understand she couldn't relay the message. I appreciate that another employee brought me my sandwich because I am not a fan of crowds. Thanks!
0;This place has constantly gone down in quality, mainly customer service. I get coupons from this place almost monthly in my mail from this place and EVERY single time I want to use one it had been a hassle to say the least. I have been over charged or charged the wrong items. Tonight took the cake when one of the front desk women thought I didn't pay for my egg rolls with my coupon and attempted to take my egg rolls out out my box after just previously eating herself and licking her fingers!!!! This was after I literally watched my order sit on the counter for 15 mins while all 4 front desk front desk clerks chatted and shared personal interest on there phones. Last time I'll be going here.
1;"This was our second time here.  We were pretty disappointed again. My husband ordered the lamb and it was over cooked and very tough to cut through and when he did get a chunk of meat off the bone he almost choked on a tiny thin little bone about 2\"" long, so he ended up just sending his entire dinner back. I had the sea bass (which is one of my favorite meals I order every where we go) and it was pretty dry.\n\nNo complaints on the appetizers and the service was okay. I'm just not sure I would really recommend this restaurant."
2;I didn't go back again.  The haircut turned out to be worse than I thought, being quite unmanageable.  I ended up going back to the local Mexican barber, who charged 12 bucks for a pretty decent haircut.\n\nI think they gave better massages than they did haircuts.  Still, it wasn't a bad place, and one could do worse.
3;The Roosevelt is a fantastic bar if you're looking for a low key evening with friends.  Located in a neighborhood that seems simultaneously sleepy and buzzing with energy, this bar is a perfect reflection of the direction that the downtown area is moving in, flaws and all.  \nBuilt in an old historic home in the Roosevelt district, the aptly named bar oozes charm in more ways than one can count.  There are 4 or 5 separate rooms inside that create a cozy atmosphere and a great sense of privacy.  Decorated with fancy wall papers, flowers on each table and a nice collection of candles, the Roosevelt would serve as an excellent place for a casual first date, but works just as well for a fun night of beer sampling and cheese-eating snobbery.\nWhile the bar offers a nice selection of wine, the Beer menu is the real star at the Roosevelt, so if your idea of a nice drink doesn't involve hops and yeast you may want to go somewhere else to imbibe.  With an impressive selection of top-shelf craft brews and imports, the Roosevelt is well worth checking out.  In fact, its the only place I have been to in my entire life that serves the Konig Ludwig Weiss, which I highly recommend trying if you make the trip out to the Roos'.\nIn spite of its many charms, the Roosevelt isn't without its flaws.  Service and seating can be hit and miss depending on when you decide to go.  Also, the lack of outdoor seating means that smokers will have to leave their drinks inside and walk out front if they want to light up.  I've been told that the ownership is working on this issue, but for the time being, if you want to smoke, you're doing it on the street.  Finally, the bar keeps odd ours which might freak out some folks in the drinking set.  I've heard rumors that they're closed on Mondays and know for a fact that on week nights they don't stay open much past midnight.  If this is an issue for you I would suggest calling ahead before planning a visit.  \nAll in all, the Roosevelt is a great place to go enjoy a few beers, relax and enjoy some conversation.  However, if you're looking for a booze fueled barn burner, you should probably look elsewhere because the Roosevelt is way too classy for that.
0;2nd time here in a row for the UFC fights. Sitting on the patio with 3 girls working, and not a single one asks if they can get me a drink in almost 2 hours. I'm use to a $100 bar bill when I go watch the fights, but now I just drink before I come and don't have to worry about them taking any of my money.
3;best place to grab dinner or lunch and the cakes there are the best you ever had
0;I came here with high expectations since so many friends recommended it. However, I was a little disappointed. \n\nI ordered a chicken salad and the chicken was dry. It kind of reminded me of the      pre-made chicken that you can buy in the freezer aisle and just pop it in the microwave to re-heat. Very displeasing.\n\nYou can tell that this place has been here for quite sometime. It was really out dated. Needs a renovation and management/staff to clean up the place. I don't think I'll be coming back. \n\nOnly good thing about this place is the cookies considering the name.
1;Ok, so growing up in san diego I remember the original real robertos.  This now chain quenches my taste buds for a bit till I can get back to san diego to have better taco shop food.  Most robertos here are still good, but thisone, well thisone plain sucks.  Cant tell why, the meat is always tough, burritos are smaller, food is burnt.  This is the only robertos in town I would not go to.  Dirty also...
3;Sat inside the dining room for lunch, open sliding doors, amazing experience.  Had some sides and turkey sandwich. Nothing to rave about but the afternoon experience was worth it.
2;"With 16 check-ins to date and the coveted 'duchess' title, I guess it's time to review this Jamba Juice location.\n\nYes... it's a chain.  I'll get that out of the way.  And if there were an alternative locally owned smoothie/juice establishment close to home, I'd drop this place in a heartbeat.  But alas, there's not.  \n\nSo when I'm craving some fruity goodness and protein, this is where I tend to go.  I  know it's a lot of sugar and it's pricey for what it is... but sometimes a smoothie just hits the spot.  \n\nI've had the following things from their menu:\n*wheatgrass shots\n*orange juice\n*yogurt cups\n*oatmeal\n*and pretty much all of the \""all fruit\"" smoothies:\n - five fruit frenzy\n - mega mango\n - peach perfection\n - pomegranate paradise\n - strawberry whirl\n\nThe original (medium) sized smoothies are pretty filling, especially once you add protein.  If you go with whey protein, it expands so much that you usually get bumped up to the next size which is really large and sometimes is enough for breakfast and a snack later on depending on my appetite.\n\nThe staff is friendly enough and there is typically never a line at this location when I go.  So like I said above, this place is A-OK for what it is... and since I'm too lazy to make my own smoothies at home and there are no amazing locally owned competitors nearby, it looks like I'll continue giving my smoothie business to Jamba Juice!"
2;We were so excited to try this Iconic Indiana Eatery.  Located at the back of the Quad Resort  Casino a escalator plops you right in front of the eatery.\n\nWe tried the signature Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, a HH ginormous blue berry pancake and a pistachio ice mocha.  Okay first off, the portions are huge!  One pancake is probably enough for at least three people.  My benedict was gigantic as well but consisting of: mashed potatoes, biscuits, tomatoes, mozzarella, scrambled eggs, fried chicken and a pink country gravy the flavor combination was a little too muddled for my liking.  I can easily see the Sage Chicken and Waffle stack as being much better.  The pancake itself was tasty but it was so huge it was on the dry side also they need to serve this thing with a pitcher of syrup and lots of butter instead of the single scoop and tiny cup it came with.\n\nMy pistachio ice mocha was very good and even better after I stirred up the whipped cream to add some additional sweetness to the drink.  I could definately taste pistachio!\n\nOver all I think we need to come back here and try the chicken waffle stack and maybe a stuffed burger to give a fair review, but for now I rate this as 3 stars.
3;I like Lee's in general, but this one is nicely spaced out and organized. \n\nGood selection on everything....wines particularly impressive though but thats fairly easy on distribution so no reason not to...I'm giving wine a backburner currently to craft beers. \n\nBeer selection of crafts and imports are decent..wish they had more, but it's impossible to get more than this and maybe a handful of other beers...most people dont get how the distribution system works and it's a hard thing to get craft beers here from the farther regions of US distributed this far out...very unfair but anyways I'll try not to get into politics.... They at least have all the basic favorites and some limited/seasonal brews, but havent spotted anything of particular rarity. Good single/big bottle selections too. \n\nService- most people indifferent but theres a few people who chime in and get excited about our purchases and talk craft beer. One girl in particular liked that we get Dogfish Head and was telling us about her favorite one and how was gonna buy a bottle today and she can't wait to crack it open later on. People have been helpful at this location when were looking for something particular.\n\nTotal Wine&More just opened....curious how it stacks up. TW&M has a few beers that Lee's does not carry that I cant wait to get my hands on.
4;"One of the best Vietnamese restaurants in AZ for sure! This is our family's go-to restaurant whenever we are craving \""broken rice\"" or happen to be on the east side. \n\nThis is probably my mom's favorite place to eat regardless of the occasion. She's asked to come here for everything. Her birthday, Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, etc. My mom is one of THE pickiest eaters I have EVER encountered, and if she likes a certain restaurant...that says A LOT!\n\nThe service is always good here. Much better than most Asian restaurants in AZ. I'm pretty sure I've had the same waiter everytime I've been there and he's always been great!\n\nI always get the Com Tam Bi Suon Cha Tau Hu Ky and it's never disappointed. When I'm feeling like a little fatty, I'll do the 7 Mon /\""All 7\"" and basically pay a little more to try a little bit of everything. That also means that I have to come with an empty stomach because...it's a whole lot of food!\n\n I wouldn't suggest doing the 10 Mon/\""All10\"" unless you were planning to either share it or take leftovers home. Their portions are rediculously large! \n\nThe pork chop is always grilled just right and their food flavoring is very consistent for the most part. Sometimes the broth is a little saltier than others, but for me...that doesn't really matter because I like the extra kick! :)\n\nYou can always ask them for a little bit of boiled water to make it less salty if you want. \n\nThis is a Vietnamese restaurant you don't want to pass up if you're ever in town. I know I don't. :p"
2;This place is packed during lunch buffet, so be sure to make a reservation before coming here!\n\nThe ambiance is great, nice decor, but very crowded. The service was alright, but sometimes not very caring (never filled my water), though it was probably because the waiters were too busy serving that many people.\n\nThe buffet was very mediocre, it consisted of multiple choices of salads, two appetizers, two vegetarian dishes, and two proteins. I was surprised to see beef and salmon served in an Indian restaurant, interesting.\n\nThere are two common problems with their food: they are under-seasoned and unbelievably dry. I had to chug water in between every bites to avoid suffocation. Maybe we went in an off-day, but that's how it was.\n\nTheir renowned Naan bread and Tandoori Chicken were big let-downs. The bread was cooked and let inside the container for too long, such that it became rubbery. The chicken was dry, and had no taste at all besides the smell of charcoal.\n\nThe salmon really saved the day, it was really moist and flavorful, delicious. The beef was overcooked and dry, because the cuts were too lean, but the sauce was enjoyable and tangy.\n\nOverall, not a bad experience, but I expected more, especially since they were boasting so much with their Tripadvisor awards.
0;DO NOT DO DELIVERY!! Can't comment on the food because we never received it. After waiting over an hour with no food- it took another 30 mins. to get thru on the phone since no one answered and the message box was full. When I did finally reach someone the customer service was horrible. When I explained the situation she told me that the driver hadn't even left yet with our order because he got lost on the previous order. I told her okay but I would need to cancel my order then and she said I needed to speak to the owner to cancel and when I politely asked to speak to the them she hung up on me!!! After I kept calling back she finally answered and said I had to contact the online company to cancel the order so my credit card wouldn't be charged for food we never got! Worst Ever!
2;I visit 1130 often, due to its close proximity to home. But I keep going back when there are often other alternatives, so that must mean something. When the weather is nice, there is nothing better than their patio on a weekend afternoon. Pull up a chair and order the first round of $2 Mimosas. They can get a little pulpy for my taste, so sometimes I'll ask for pulp-free OJ. But come on...$2 Mimosas.\n\nI've had food at 1130 and its never been anything to write home about (much less a review), so I won't. They have a pretty good happy hour and the bar area often gets quite busy (there seem to be a lot of meetings held there, like social clubs and post-convention types). I've always had good service and they at least pretend to remember me, which I appreciate.\n\nI know what I'll remember...$2 Mimosas!
4;I heard about this place through Groupon, & I'm so glad I did. \nWe ate here on a Fri from 6-7 pm & we were seated right away.\nOur server was very fast, attentive & friendly. \nThe food also came out super fast. \nWe ordered the daisho fried rice, beef yakisoba, shark's tale roll, gyoza (theirs is deep fried, not pan fried), & shrimp tempura. \nEverything was deeeeeeeelicious & good presentation too! \nThe tempura sauce really stood out because it wasn't like the normal tempura sauce, it was a lot better - really flavorful.\nThe food portions were a good amount for the price.\nThey also have AYCE sushi.\nHappy hour is from 3-6 pm and 9-11 pm. Half off chef's special rolls.\nThe lighting was nice & bright. I don't like dim restaurants where I can barely see the menu.\nI live far from this place, but it is worth the drive, so I will be back!
3;This review is only of the sushi menu as I have never ordered anything off the regular menu.\n\nThis place has awesome happy hour and reverse happy hour specials. $2 Sapporo and Kirin, 99 cent nigiri and $4 rolls. I'm not going to lie to you, this is not sushi for sushi snobs, and I have sushi snob friends that refuse to go here. But if you're not...I have eaten here over a dozen times and only 1 visit was the fish a little under par. The service is quite good and the sushi comes out pretty fast. \n\nThe restaurant itself is cute and well decorated with a nice ambiance. It is nice to have a place like this in South Phoenix with cheaper prices (and WAY better music) than the place down the road.
4;If you are craving a crispy, buttery, delicious, elevated grilled cheese- this is where to go!\n\nThe owner, or whoever it was that helped us was so so nice and friendly! The inside was very clean, and really nice. \n\nHere is what we ordered: \n\nThe B.L. Grilled Cheese - 8.50\nVermont white cheddar, tomatoes, mixed greens & bacon on Sour Dough.\n\nThe Flying Pig - 8.50\nTurkey breast, bacon, roasted tomatoes, lettuce, herb spread & havarti cheese on country white.\n\nThe BL was so ridiculously delicious- wow it was a serious work of art. I have never seen a grilled sandwich like it- i ran my fork across the top and it was completely crisp and buttery- everything worked so well and bacon on it- yes please! Wow, seriously heaven. I wanted ten more lol.\n\nMy husband is a little more traditional and can't resist turkey, bacon, or havarti so obviously the Flying Pig sandwich was perfect. I had a bite and it was delcious but a standard sandwich to me- my husband though was in heaven over it haha.\n\nHe added the drink/chips combo. I added a drink and grabbed some pesto pasta salad from their cold case. The pasta salad had good flavor, but not sure when it was made as the noodles were pretty tough. As we were leaving my husband grabbed a rice pudding to go- the flavor was so good but the rice was completely undercooked, making it pretty inedible. Sadly we didn't try it until we got home otherwise I am sure they would have refunded our money. \n\nOverall, we left very satisfied, not super filling, but super super delicious. Will definitely go back!
0;I just moved to the area and needed several big ticket items. When i first came in I was pleased with the service I received in appliances. About a week later i placed my order over the phone to take advantage of their black friday pricing. When i mentioned to the person taking my order that I would like to pay with a lowes account to take advantage of the 5% off and financing i was told i would have to be in the store physically to do so ,otherwise that person i worked with would not get credit for the order. OK,i liked her style and service and passed on the deal as i planned originally to pay cash anyways. (nice guy ,huh) I thought so...then i mentioned i had a 10% off coupon and was told it was not valid with this order..ok ( i believe you..lol..mistake).Note: i subsequently spoke to a manger about the 10% off,he honored it because it was valid..nice huh? dont you just love employees who will go to any length to get the deal done for themselves? amazing! Anyways fast forward a few days I followed up to make sure everything was on schedule..surprise they had it scheduled to be delivered 3 days before I was arriving..after i specifically told this person over and over the date I wanted (veneer starting to crack on salesperson of the year). Day of delivery,no call from delivery service as promised to set up delivery for that day. Surprise we forgot we will be there later today Mr B.......OK Delivery arrives...MrB we have a damage on the side of your fridge ..but if you accept it we will give you a 15% discount on the ENTIRE delivery....lol OK sure Ill take it...now mind you i asked 5 times and had them put it on the delivery invoice. If they didnt take the 15% of all I wouldent accept any. this was crystal clear. So following up as a professional does ...I found that my credit hadent shown up yet and spoke to a lowes manager on duty. went something like this mike:checking on my credit for the 15% lowes:sorry your not getting the 15% on the order only the fridge mike: thats not what i was told lowes:are you crazy ,why would we give you 15% on the whole order only the fridge was damaged? mike: that makes sense to me but your delivery service offered this deal to me,so i expect you to honor it lowes:no chance mike: i plan to make many big ticket items for my new home if you dont honor your promiise I will never do business with your company again lowes: have a nice life mike: very nice. \n\nOh he also tried to say that lowes contracts for the delivery's which they do and if i had a problem i should take it up with them.\n\nLISTEN VERY CLOSELY:\n\n1. I dont like being lied to by your employee to close a deal to start\n\n2. Your follow up and order system are horrible.\n\n3.I bought these products from YOU not XYZ delivery service..YOU need to call them up to resolve it. If i have someone working for me I am very clear on what they can and cannot offer to satisfy a delivery. Its not up to me to make it right nor am i responsible to fix or train your delivery contractor on the art of negotiation. He told me what I was getting and as a representative you are obligated to take care of me.Wherever you extract that money from to cover that mistake is not my business or concern.\n\nThis transaction illustrates the clunky nature of corporate transactions and the mentality that is accepted by compartmentalizing the responsibility for all actions along the entire life span of the order. By doing this they can blame each other and wash their hands of the problem. Very clever...you just lost a customer and all of the friends who he knows. But ,I know all you guys do is average it out over many transactions. I doubt Ill be missed for a nano second.\n\nHome Depot here I come !
1;When I came here the other day, it was as If all the employees were stoned.  Haha. Seriously. They were out of chicken, steak and salsa. There were no small drink cups ready. There were no clean trays ready for in-store dining. The cashier forgot to ring me up for a drink (because there were no cups). She forgot to grab a bag of chips I had paid for. She asked me 3 times which beer I wanted. 3 times, apologizing saying she forgot. \n\nYikes. There was only 2 people in front of me and my friend and it took us (not exaggerating) 18 minutes to get through the line and to the table.
3;Went on a Thursday night and only had our group of 5 and another couple in our pod, so had plenty of room to walk around.  One person in our group had a cane and they offered to slow the pod down even further for him to get on.  Great customer service right there.  They had a ladies night special for $19.99 which included a night ride and two cocktails.  Pretty good value.  Even though I live in Vegas I enjoyed the ride.  It was nice seeing the Bellagio fountain go off.
4;My favorite park! I love hiking up the hill and enjoying the view. The park is always clean and well maintained. My daughter really enjoys the water feature and playground here also.
3;This place is so awesome!! I love that their foods are based on Hawaiian dishes. First thing I want to say is.. RED VELVET PANCAKES!!!!! It's so awesome!! Also try their spam fried rice. It's so good. Everything on their menu is good.
4;This my second trip to the course for Wells Fargo championship.  The course is amazing.  The upkeep of the entire grounds were amazing!
0;Went there today to enjoy a lunch and almost walked out...A family allowed their kid to run around the place, screaming and  throwing a fit and they SAT THERE AND MUNCHED ON CHIPS....this kid sat on the floor and screamed...and they did nothing...Mom got up once, to show off her platform shoes and shorts so  tight, you could see the outline of her Vagina....Where was the MGR? He ran to the kitchen when the kid started to scream..NO BALLS...\nWe have been going there since it opened but NEVER AGAIN....\n\nI will miss their great food, and service, but I DO NOT WANT TO BE ENTERTAINED BY YOUR KID!!!!
4;Very nice Hotel
4;coming from the east coast i was looking for a good delivery chinese place and Red House is just awesome. their general tso's is great, chicken and brocoli is amazing.\n\nit's very inexpensive and quick delivery
0;"TERRIBLE, AWFUL experience at Bahama Breeze the other day.\n\nWe were seated right away for an early lunch.  The first thing I noticed was that the TVs were playing reruns of South Park.  Now, I'm no prude, but there were lots of children around and the sound was on.  I don't know that I would take too kindly to someone playing that kind of show during a lunch with my children.  No one complained, but it kinda rubbed me the wrong way.  A small thing, but a little disturbing and not typical of what I've seen at Bahama Breeze.\n\nOur server came and took our order, which consisted of ham and cheese croquettes for an appetizer, soup and salad for me, and the chef's special for my fianc\u00e9.  Our food came out quickly, but sans appetizer.  I asked the person who brought our food where the appetizers were and she went to investigate.  I had to endure listening to loud arguments in the kitchen until, finally, they figured out that the waitress never rang up our appetizer.  Never mind that the operating system computer was literally two feet from our table... somehow she forgot.  No biggie... it happens... except that she was NOT apologetic at all.  She came over and said, and I quote, \""I forgot to put in your appetizer order.  So do you still want them or not?\""  She said it like it was MY fault that it happened.  I didn't wanna pay for an appetizer to be eaten AFTER my meal.  Kinda defeats the purpose, ya know?  t declined and settled upon eating my soup and salad.\n\nI have had the chicken tortilla soup before and usually LOVE it.  However, this time it was barely lukewarm.  Furthermore, the vegetables were so crunchy that I felt like a cow chewing cud with each bite.  I get that some soups have firmer vegetables, but this was a whole different type of crunchy.  Our waitress was nowhere to be found (presumably hiding from us after the appetizer incident), so we asked another server to send it back.  The server informed our waitress about what happened, and they proceeded to LOUDLY discuss how I was just trying to be fussy and that the soup WASN'T cold enough to send back RIGHT BY OUR TABLE.  I'm the customer.  Isn't that up to my discretion?  The soup was room temperature.  To me, that's cold.  And I have to pay, so I expect hot soup.  Period.  I couldn't believe that it was up for discussion, especially within my earshot.\n\nThe manager came over and brought us a free order of croquettes and fruit salad and asked us about the incident.  When I explained about the soup, the manager proceeded to defend the temperature of the soup, the crunchiness of the vegetables, and the behavior of the waitress.  Really??!?!  Oh, so you gave us all this free food to make up for something that apparently wasn't done incorrectly?  The attitude was basically that they were gonna try to satisfy me, but that they really shouldn't because I'm the picky bitch who sent back soup I should have choked down.  Unacceptable service.  \n\nWe paid our bill and left no tip - when I hear a waitress gripe about me to her coworkers, she doesn't deserve a tip.  Yet, it was interesting to watch her rush to our table the second we signed the receipt and stood up.  Heh.  Dream on, crazy waitress.\n\nSteer clear of this place - the service is sub-par.  There are much better places to dine in this city."
1;Two or three of the coolest, most creative exhibits I've seen, including he polka dot room. Problem is, that three is the grand total of exhibits, literally nothing else.  Granted a couple floors were being renovated, but we trekked there with our kids and expected to spend a hour or two there, but we were done in 20 minutes and not thrilled about how long it took to get there.  Plus its in an area where there is nothing else.  Since the building was being renovated they were nice enough to charge us half price, $25.00 for all four of us, but any more and we would have been angry.
3;"Excellent pizza, very slow service.\n\nCame here with my boyfriend and my parents for a late lunch. The total meal ended up taking almost 2 hours. The food was excellent; however, waiting so long for our meal was painful. Here's the breakdown:\n\nService: Our server was super nice; however, there seemed to be some kitchen issues. As I said above, it took almost 2 hours to get 3 pizzas, which is not acceptable, especially when the place wasn't busy at all. \n\nFood: TASTY! The food quality and flavor is what earned this place 4 stars. \nWe ordered:\n2 Settebellos- Amazing! Fresh ingredients and perfect thin crust. \n1 Capricciosa- Delicious! I couldn't stop eating it. Every toping was fresh and of high quality. The dough was great. Thin and cooked perfectly. Softer in the center, but crispy on the crust. The sauce was delicate and complimented the toppings' flavors nicely.  \n1 Kid's Margherita with added prosciutto- my mom loved this! She ate all of it and she usually never finished anything. She kept raving about the favors even after we got home. \n1 Rucola- Loved the dressing! \n1 Beet Salad- I really enjoyed this, but it's a very different salad. The warm goat cheese was very good and so were the beets. You have to really like beets to enjoy this salad. \n\nAtmosphere: Nice. Nothing special and much more on the casual side. \n\nPrices: Great. I would actually pay a lot more than what they charge because the quality and flavor of the pizza is so excellent.\n\nOverall, I will be back, but not when I'm in a hurry! Fantastic pizza and good salads. If you're in the mood for pizza and you like thin crust come here, you won't be disappointed."
2;our local newspaper. Lots of good stuff but the same as online. lvrj.com\nGet the paper a lot cheaper at McDonald's
1;WOW!  All the 4 and 5 star reviews.  I'll not question their opinion....I'll only say that after 6-8 visits here, (usually at lunch), I would never go there again.
4;I love coming here! The staff is fantastic, there's a huge chalkboard wall, candy, ice cream, shaved ice, drinks, plus water and ice of course. It's an amazing atmosphere. They have a wall filled with photos of customers. Best place to get great tasting water!
4;Very casual place in the hotel lobby with good food and great, friendly service. Love the breakfast items available all day. My husband liked his turkey panini with yummy sweet potato fries. Lots of choices to go as well. Pricey, but what isn't along the strip.
2;"My boss and I ordered from here for lunch today and were pleased with our order. I got the teriyaki and tempura combo, which comes with chicken teriyaki, 1 piece of shrimp tempura, 2 pieces of vegetable tempura, 2 pieces of a california roll and a small side salad. My boss got the avocado roll and the spicy tuna roll.\n\nI thought the chicken teriyaki was good, nothing too special and pretty general. The california roll was nice and fresh. The tempura unfortunately was soggy by the time I brought it back to the office, and I felt that the shrimp could have been cooked better. The salad was very, very small and was mainly just iceberg lettuce- it was very underwhelming. \n\nMy boss enjoyed his sushi, but he was peeved that their \""avocado roll\"" had krab in it. He doesn't eat shellfish, so we had to call to see if it was real crab or not. It was basically a cali roll with avocado on top and eel sauce.\n\nOverall for a quick lunch if you're craving teriyaki it is pretty good, but then again there are a lot of other options in the area too."
2;Pretty good pizza for Vegas generally speaking. It's a bit hard to find stashed in the corner of the casino, but good for a quick bite.
0;We went back a second time because we thought the poor service and food was just a fluke. However, the waitress & hostess attitudes were still just as nasty as the food.
0;"Update 11/11/10. Hostess was stuffy and couldn't imagine someone would go there by themselves. So she sat everyone before me then asked me when the rest of my party was coming. No tables left, I sat at the bar not exactly in a great mood. Don't sit at the bar if you want anyone to pay attention to you. When they do, they won't be able to hear you, so they'll throw their arms up in the arm and not bring you what you ordered, until the next bartender comes along and says their co-worker \""forgot\"". Service here must be consistently horrible. I keep giving it another shot and always leave disappointed and in a worse mood than when I came.\n\nTrue to form, the food was decent.  Not great, not good, but decent. But decent food + horrible service + attitude + getting elbowed in the head by the drunk guy standing next to you = no buenas dias for me."
0;The ambiance is nice, the bartenders fairly good, I had the club sandwich which was pleasant enough UNTIL I STARTED VOMITING LIKE A CLUB SANDWICH FILLED MOUNT ST HELENS. Not much else I could blame it on, I had breakfast about 8 hours before. Sooooo, come here for drinks, and if you order something off the menu, don't skimp, because you might be tasting it twice. or three times. or in my case, four.
4;Offered to make it right when I had a problem so I can't complain. Good food, good atmosphere and hopefully they are working in customer service.
1;FYI  Price have gone up at nearly all sergakis establishments.\n\nPassed through on a Saturday night for a friends birthday. The karaoke master was a fair guy with a killer voice. The people were awesome with one guy throwing confetti at those brave/drunk enough to take the stage. My sangria was horribly unpleasant. Everyone I was with laughed at me as I poured all of the pitcher into cups, then threw away the ice and poured all the juice back on in. It was LOW alcohol content and absolutely flavorless. The staff weren't necessarily unpleasant, just the place itself that leaves much to be desired. Cash only is just the company being damn lazy. Sergakis should know better.
3;This place was nice and loungy which was what I was exactly what I was looking for after walking around for 4ish hours straight. My feet were killing me and I needed a drink and some food. I never have a concept what time it is when I'm on vacation until I realize how hungry I am. We sat down in some big comfy chairs near the bar and soon our server was over to take our drink orders. We both just got beer because I was more focused in perusing the food menu. The boy got chicken wings with teryaki sauce and I ordered the chicken wontons. They were priced pretty close to each other but the difference in the amount of food was crazy. Our server brings out this huge BUCKET of wings and a bowl of teryaki sauce for my boyfriend and then I see my plate of 3 teeny tiny little wontons. :( Don't get me wrong, they were delicious but they were smaller than bite size and when I am hungry I can put away a large amount of food. Luckily, I was able to sneak a few delicious chicken wings away from J so I ended up fairly satisfied.
1;"The only reason for two stars is bc Katsuya is at the hotel. But even then, the customer service at the SLS of dumb idiots get no stars. No one obtains reliability or accountability these days. Jankiest \""new\"" hotel I have ever been to. Got into my room and the light was out, tv froze plenty of times and they have the lamest \""cable\"" tv. When I checked out, they charged me for mini bar crap that had dust on top of the boxes that I didn't even eat, when I declined room service for my entire stay. And the gnarliest thing was that there were still pubes in my shower. \n\nWhat a bunch of dumb idiots that are running the place."
0;Worst place ever for alterations. They ruined 4 shirts and two pairs of pants. They took out to material and didn't leave enough room for future changes. \n\nStay away!!!!!
3;Went for breakfast for the 99cent bloody Mary's. they are small but a buck you can't complain. Got the hevous rancheros & they were excellent! Nice portion & very filling. Potatoes were nicely seasoned, beans were just typical beans. If you are looking for a good quick breakfast on the strip check em out.
4;One of the best meals of my life! This review is going to be long, for those that are interested in details... move along if you aren't. \n\nWe were seated in the lounge. Maybe because we looked young? Maybe because we were only semi-dressed up? Who knows, but the lounge was great... service was awesome, chairs were comfy, and the guys will love the outfits the waitresses wear in this section. \n\nComplimentary duck fat fries... to be honest, this wasn't that good! I've had duck fat fries in Chicago and wow, these don't even compare to those. However, they were free, so I'm not complaining. \n\nKobe tartare... soo.. soo.. good! Very incredible presentation. Comes out on a plate with tons of ingredients around it (mustard, salt, etc) and they mix it into a ceviche looking/dip type stuff tableside and put it in a martini glass over ice..you spread it on hot grilled pita bread. So freaking amazing. \n\nFor our main course, we got 1 american kobe filet ($72), and the foie gras sliders! Both were so incredible. Steak was the best steak of my life.. hands down, can't compare any other steak to it. Perfectly marbled fat, but still lean.. not an ounce of chewiness. Foie gras sliders were little bites of heaven. I love foie gras, but usually find it way too rich, BUT placed on a bun with a sort of pear mixture, it was flawless. The flavors just worked perfectly. Best presentation of foie gras I've eaten, ever, anywhere. \n\nDessert was the beignets and creme brulee plate. I consider the beignets in NOLA much much better, but my bf disagreed. These were more dense than the ones I'm used to. \n\nOverall, can't recommend this place more. Dinner for 2 with 2 cocktails was $200 with tip, however we did split the foie gras sliders and a steak rather than getting 2 steaks. Definitely worth the splurge every once in awhile.
4;Howdy!\n\nSome restaurants are destination restaurants, others are worthwhile eating at if you're in the neighborhood. After having a Michigo with onions (a pogo covered with Michigan sauce and onions) I am seriously contemplating moving to Verdun so that I do not have to hike across God's half acre in order to eat there. \n\nIt is is better than a destination restaurant, I wish it was my kitchen.
2;Solid, cost efficient hotel. Better than Excalibur, and treasure island. Luxor is almost an entirely interior based hotel, and is unfortunately not very central to the rest of the strip.\n\nMassive interior volume, and good restaurants. Pretty easy to navigate compared to other casinos. Rooms are large in size. Was in double bed in pyramid. Decent gym. Equipment could be a touch more modern and it could be larger. Water and towels provided.\n\nBig minus = no wifi in hotel room. You can connect via ethernet, but who plugs in their computer to an ethernet cable? My macbook pro doesn't even have an ethernet port.
0;This place committed just about all of the worse offenses a restaurant can. First, my group's waiter seemed to be bothered by us because we walked in when the place was empty (you'd think they would be excited to have a chance to make a tip). Second, I ordered the spicy scallop roll and after eating one piece of it I called the waiter over and told them that the scallop was bad (rancid!). My tables waiter then proceeded to yell over to the sushi chef that I said the scallops were not bad, and the chef argued with me. Now, this is when I got extremely P.O.ed and told them to take the roll back, don't bring anything else, and don't charge me. Lucky they agreed or they would have been hearing from me again the next day when I was sick to my stomach. I can only imagine what would have happened to me had I eaten more than one piece...Don't risk your life by trying this dive...
0;I've stayed at New York, New York, the Aladdin, the Golden Nugget, Planet Hollywood, and T.I. This is my LEAST FAVORITE. Had a decent room with a nice view of the strip and the show outside, but it was LOUD, too bright, and there was mold in the grout in my bathroom. Also, the bathroom was something I would expect to find at a Best Western. Definitely the cheapest bathroom of the places I've stayed. In fact, my bathroom is a LOT nicer at home. Felt like I took a step down staying at this place. Hate the location. I could go on. This place is way overpriced for what you get.
0;This place is sooo dirty and nasty ! I don't know how ppl can eat there ... The food might be good never at there but come on really you would food that you don't know we're it has been stored ....
0;Food was good but service was slow! Did not get waters until we were seated for 15 mins. Had to track down our server just to get orders in. It was not busy so not sure what the issue was. To top it off there were flies. Fortunately my girls thought it was funny when I swatted one. If yelp support typed pictures I would post it as evidence!
1;2,5\n\nCheap and edible aimed at the overfed and overaged.\n\nI have an aunt that swears by this place (she's 83) so you now get the demographic of this place.\n\nI take her here because she's got like lots of club points,and the buffet is basically free.\n\nThe bold and beautiful do not frequent Sam's a lot..
4;Outstanding business! The only place to go for outdoor and survival gear. And the best part, its a small mom n pop business! Excellent customer service and very knowledgable.
0;"Alright Ill start by prefacing this with the fact that I have been going to clubs for a very long time and this includes a great deal of Vegas clubs.  I don't buy tables so you are getting the \""average citizen\"" experience review:\n\nSummary: This place is HORRIBLE on every level except the music and lights.\n\nFirst of all they LET WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE IN, and I am going by vegas standards.  YOU CANNOT MOVE after 12.  There are two dance floors or maybe I should call them \""stand floors.\""  I mean most clubs get overcrowded but this one takes the cake.\n\nSecond of all the bouncers are THE WORST.  I mean they won't even let you stand in one place if its ANYWHERE NEAR a walkway.  Did I mention that everything is a walkway if its not a dance floor?  So where am I supposed to go? That pool of people on the dance floor where I will get trapped forever?  Oh wait, I can't because the bouncer already blocked the main entrance to the floor. . . because its too crowded . . . So I guess I have to just constantly scoot around shoulder to shoulder with hundreds of people.  \n\nThird, this venue is way overpriced for how small and maze-like it is, marquee and XS are so much more open and there are actually places to chill and relax, talk, or dance at those other venues.\n\nOnly consolation is that music,  lights and special effects are good but nothing special compared to the other big clubs in vegas.  . . . \n\nMy advice, avoid this overblown attempt at making money in a small standing cave that they call a nightclub."
1;Review in brief:\n\nPros: Location and cleanliness\n\nCons: The staff is poorly trained, very slow and unskilled.  They do not know what they have in stock nor do they understand how to operate a cash register.  The gas prices are always on the high end.\n\nThis location is less than half a mile from my house so I frequent it more than any other gas station.  On multiple occasions I have been charged wrong and/or given the wrong item by the cashiers.\n\nFor those of you who are stuck frequenting this station I feel your pain.
0;I wish I could say this was a great place, but unfortunately it just sucked. The staff was nice but the dentist was not nice nor professional. He gave me Novocain in my cheek! In a two hour appointment he only spent an hour with me, making me wait while my mouth was in pain, and prepped to have my cavities filled. He didn't feel like finishing the job (AS WAS SCHEDULED) and ended up scheduling me for a week later even though they knew I had prior arrangements to be out of town for school and needed my dental work done before I left.  I think that says it all. \nI would not recommend this dentist to anyone
1;A less then stellar brew pub on a less then stellar street. If you want a good brew pub do yourself the favor of going to Dieu du Ciel (out of the way but well worth it).\n\nThis place is over priced with watery beers, don't go. Oh and the live music is usually not very good.
1;"I was really hoping this place would be a new favorite, but I can't. Finding a local brewery so close was very exciting to discover, but was surprised by their beer selection. I guess I never saw Scottsdale as being a big craft beer hot spot, so was surprised by how limiting their selection is to very strong beers.\n\nWe started with a flight so sample their selection, and soon realized that all their eers are pretty much just very strong IPAs and Stouts. I like to think I am pretty open to most craft beers, but I do enjoy variety and switching it up. So taking into account the relatively higher prices (especially for food) and the limited strong beers; this place just didn't strike me as somewhere me and my friends can go to for a good evening of beers.\n\nBut, on the positive side, the staff was all very friendly, including the servers and bartender. Also, the other customers that did enjoy the beers seemed to be all having a good time. So if you enjoy really strong beers then this is your place."
1;"The yogurt was fine, atmophere is \""modern\"".  The issue we had is they didn't have any information on gluten.  My daughter has Celiac Disease and has to eat gluten free and they couldn't tell us anything.  The guy even stated many people have asked for this information."
0;"Don't go to this TGIF!!!! The atmosphere and manager's attitude are both despicable.  My friend and I stopped in after 7 pm and the restaurant was partially crowded, so we were seated immediately. We saw the bus boys cleaning the table and seats with the same cloth; we saw employees using their cell phones while working; the talking/noise was unusually loud; the atmosphere was scary. We could hardly eat for looking around at the other clientele fearing for our lives.  We didn't know if someone was going to shoot or not.\n  We complained to the manager about what we were experiencing,  he didn't care, didn't apologize for any of it and was very nonchalant. He simply walked away. \n    Because we were so appalled with the atmosphere and what we saw, we called him back and asked for the GM's name/card. He became indignant, started getting loud and still did not care or apologize. When asked his name he said Chad (no last name)........cause he would be too easy to find on facebook.......hahaha!! \""He's the only Chad at that store and the only manager in the company named Chad.\"" Still no last name.......still he didn't care nor apologize......The total atmosphere at this TGIF has drastically changed!!!!\n   And oh, the hostesses at the front dot even know the manager's name.....they don't know who they are working for........and they also ask for Id when you are over 18 and not sitting at the bar!!!!! Wth???\n      1 star.......and won't be back........"
2;Cheeburger Cheeburger is a 50's themed diner.   Think pink neon, 50's music, big burgers, big shakes, big fries and high blood pressure for all.  Take some fish oil or something afterwards and you'll be fine.\n\nGet your burger for 6 for the quarter pounder, up to 10 for the full pounder.  Comes with cheese and all the fixings you want save for the premiums like bacon.  I got bleu cheese and chopped garlic.  They have 20 some odd toppings.  Go nuts.\n\nIf you are a shake enthusiast, then get your oreo cookie, mint and mango juice or whatever floats your boat.  They have over 300,000 combinations.  If you are a math geek, you can check the calcuation while you are waiting for your burger.  30 minutes or so on a good day.  They make everything to order and from scratch.\n\nI didn't ask, but the ground beef was about of 15% fat quality, much better than the 30% more places, even supposedly high end places use.  Fries were from whole potatoes, so skin and tiny leftover crunchies galore.\n\nThe closest competitor might be Fuddruckers, though I haven't been to one of those in ages.\n\nTo sum, good place for burger and shake enthusiasts with a little time to kill.  If you think a big mac is the bees knees, this place is a total waste of time for you.
3;"I'm not a \""techie,\"" but they do have a lot of different items in here.  I've bought a computer, laptop case, antennas, etc... and never had a problem here.  The sales people can be somewhat vultures, but most seem to know what they're talking about.\n\nIf you return an item have your argument ready.   They will listen to your argument, and then send you to an area where they fix computers.  Once there, present your concern, the tech person there will \""yay or nay,\"" based off their tests, and then back to the returns line for either an exchange, or your money back.\n\nIn my particular case I believed myself to be paranoid that I had bought a computer that emitted brushing noises internally.  The tech guy recognized this, marked it down, and they were very accommodating in exchanging the computer.  I don't know if anything was actually wrong with the computer, but I appreciate them addressing this \""paranoid\"" concern.\n\nTelevisions, speakers, vacuums, food, coffee bar, various gift cards, accessories, small tech parts, and more, Fry's has it.  Not everything is priced the same that you would get online - sure, but some good deals can be had here.  And like the person below said if you need it right now, this is the place to go."
1;"I didn't stay here but I did go to the Hooters Restaurant inside and wander the casino floor. The restaurant was strange. They had two entrances, one for the \""lounge\"" type side and the other for the regular restaurant. There was a long ass line for the regular side and none for the \""lounge\"". You get the same food and everything and the shit looked the same so I just walked in and sat at the \""lounge\"" bar. Anyway, I'm a fan of Hooters and it upsets me that there isn't one in Yuma where I'm residing at the moment so I try to hit one when I'm away and partake in their wings which I enjoy. OH BOY...they served me 10 of the smallest, meatless, overcooked wings I've ever seen. It was so embarrassing that I didn't even feel like complaining (I don't like to have food to be redone, fuck that)..Shit, I was drinking for $1 a beer since I was gambling on their little electronic commputer thingy. Lost $3 playing blackjack. Left those shitty wings and wandered the casino for a bit. Wanted to partake in one of their heavily advertised $3 blackjack tables but was unable due to them only having one which had a line of other cheap bastards waiting to get on. The one thing that made this place a 2 instead of 1 was that I was able to park in there outside lot for free and walk across the street to the MGM where UFC 160 was being held. That's basically the only reason I was there, was able to make a quick getaway when the fight was over. Fuck Vegas traffic. So, in short, utilize the parking, fuck the food and casino."
3;I Love this place. I had the vegetarian sandwich with sub- goat cheese...and it was wonderful. I am not vegan/ vegetarian either.I also had a bite of my friends turkey ...added Bacon and avocados...so good. The bread it so soft...and I highly recommend the potato cakes!!!
1;"The food was decent.  The service was terrible.  When we got to the restaurant, there were only seven occupied tables.  Only one waitress, and a man who seemed to do nothing except deliver change and receipts.  It took about 20 minutes for the waitress to take our order.  Food came out pretty quick after that.  We had to refill our own water glasses... thankfully the water pitcher was left on an empty table.\n\nAs for the food.  It was decent but nothing spectacular compared to other Chinese restaurants we've been to in the past.  \n\nSeven tables is a lot to expect for one waitress.  I would have been more understanding if she was efficient or the man \""helping\"" on the front end was doing something to help her.  We normally start our tip at 20% and go up from there.  The service experience was so bad here, we left 10%."
1;The restaurant was busy and seemed like it would be worth my while.. I was correct in one way.. the cashew chicken was great. My favorite dish, and the reason I went, I'd the green curry. I've eaten it thousands of times all over the world and haven't had one that lacked flavor the way this dish did. There was a slightly discernable curry flavor, but no where near what I expected and have come to know Thai curry dishes to taste like. Perhaps it was a simple oversight by the cook. Either way, I will not be returning.
3;"I first started going to this place because of a Groupon. I thought the \""new member tour\"" was required so I signed up for it and was COMPLETELY turned off by the heavy sales pitch. I was very close to just scrapping the whole thing and chalking up the $20 Groupon as a loss - I felt like I was being sold a used car. But, I decided to give it a chance because the thought of going to LVAC again made me want to vomit.\n\nSo, I took a Barefoot Bootcamp class first and was in love. I have since attended many other classes and I have to say that the cleanliness, quality of instructors, and variety of classes and times really make this place worth it. They're running a special right now for $399 for a year of unlimited classes, which is only $10 more a month than what I was paying for LVAC.\n\nNow for the reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5... the front desk people are absolutely awful (with the exception of Patrick, who is also an instructor). I mean, they are horrendous. There is a huge disconnect between the passion and enthusiasm that the instructors have and the \""I'm just here to earn a paycheck\"" attitude of the front desk staff. I have never once been engaged upon walking in (unless Patrick is there) and when I did sign up (mind you, handing over FOUR HUNDRED dollars for the membership), the girl acted as if I was an inconvenience. Really unacceptable service. They are lucky that the instructors more than make up for the terrible front desk service but I wonder how much business they lose because people are turned off by the bad service (and the used car sales pitch during the \""tour\"").\n\nAll in all, I have started seeing changes in my body so I am committed. If we can just get some guest service training for those front desk folks, I'll give this place 5 stars all day long!"
1;The aroma of a dining place can be a great advertisement, or a way to scare people away.  \n\nThis place falls in the the latter as there was a strong smell of sewage here.\n\nSmell aside I decided to sit outside and risk my stomach to bring you this review.\n\nWe had a veggie yakisoba $6, which was a bit dry but the veggies were not overcooked. The flavor was alight but not great. We also had a veggie bowl, overly steam unoriginal veggies over white rice and an sweet sauce $4.   I was unimpressed in may ways.\n\nThe ambiance is a bit depressing. There is a ATM covered by a trash bag, that bad smell, and a menu that looks like they printed at kinks and taped it over the failed franchise that once occupied this location.
1;This is really not anything special. Problem is... All the breakfast restaurants blow in this area. The service is bad, the hostess is insane, and the food is reeaaaaaaaallllyyy average.
3;I have always been a fan of Smith's and with a recent relocation I find myself shopping at Smith's more often. It's not quite as close as Albertson's, but is a little more cost effective. The produce section is well organized and full of fresh choices. Ditto for the meat department. Their weekly ad is always full of stuff we need and the prices on the items that aren't on sale usually won't break the bank. Kroger has a pretty solid line of products too that are comparable to national name brands. During my latest visit the store was busy, but there was no shortage of help and plenty of check stands open.
3;As you may or may not know the Signature at MGM Grand is a condo hotel property. This means the rooms are all owned by private parties and they are handed off to the hotel for rent when the private party is not using it. Anyways, my experience was nothing less than a fantastic all the way. I researched the hotel before hand so I knew that it doesn't have major restaurants, I knew that it does not have a casino it the hotel, and I knew that it was about a 10-15 minute walk from the strip. That said, the hotel rooms are outstanding, the views that we had were awesome, and short of a little check in snafu, the entire stay was everything you would expect for the awesome reviews this hotel receives. And add my review to that list. By the way, the BALCONY rooms are the best!
4;"First of all the place smells fantastic. It made waiting for our desserts all the more difficult! Since we couldn't just get one thing (that would be wrong on so many levels) my party of three each ordered something and we sampled all. The Max Brenner pizza with \""the works\"" was a marshmellowy delight-although the crust was way too thick-we ended up just scraping the topping off and eating that. The peanut butter and chocolate sundae was heavenly (our favorite) and the third was the chocolate cake with chocolate ganache inside served with ice cream and a chocolate \""shot\"". We had lots of left-overs which made for tasty late night snacks. \n\nThe fondue was another popular favorite ordered by many of the tables around us. I'd be curious to try the regular menu also, but I don't think I could go there and NOT get dessert. Truly indulgent.\n\nThe staff was friendly but tried to clear our plates too quickly! You know you can lose a couple fingers that way if you're not careful. It would have been nice not to have felt rushed."
2;meh it was OK. had 2 slices of pepperoni and a salad. im just not a fan of these pizza by the slice, buffet style pizzerias.  cool place though, and the guys working seemed pretty cool my buddy spilt his beer and one of the workers was given him shit, it was funny and it was all in good fun.
4;Our favorite spot for a movie.  \n\nThe key is to be a member of the regal crown club.  It's free! You get loads of freebies for being an avid moviegoer like free tickets, free, popcorn, soda, candy...or reduced prices in the aformentioned.\n\nPopcorn is always good here.  Theaters are clean, modern, and comfy.  \n\nThe downside is the potty is quite a hike after you travel down that long hall to the theaters.  An emergency break could cost you 5-6 minutes of viewing time!
2;I haven't been to Pei Wei in a couple years and it sounded good. We came during the lunch rush and it was crazy!\n\nAfter 20 minutes in line we were able to order our food. The woman behind the counter could hardly hear us. I felt like I was screaming my order at her. After placing our order we found a place to sit down. With how busy it was the tables were being cleared very fast which was nice.\n\nThe food took quite awhile to come out and after standing in line for so long I was about to eat the silverware and napkins sitting in front of me. \n\nIf you want to have a conversation during your meal I suggest you bring an old fashioned ear trumpet horn so your companion can shout into one end and you can listen on the other end. It was LOUD in there. \n\nI ordered the Mongolian Steak with brown rice. I really liked the brown rice. The meat was a little chewy and heavy on the sauce. \n\nOverall I would like to try more items off their menu, however I think I will call ahead and pick up.
0;Went here today and the place was closed! I read online that they closed due to health code fines. Too bad i didn't get to try it! :(
3;Yes, Maggiano's is a chain restaurant that can be found in most US states.\nYes, it's just typical, hearty Italian dishes.\nYes, it gets pretty packed here at this particular one.\nAnd yes, I had a pretty awesome experience here even though I would have preferred to dine at a Michelin starred or famous celebrity chef's restaurant here in LV.\n\nI joined some of my old colleagues from my previous job here for dinner during the Interop convention. We had a driver take us from our hotel to this restaurant so there was obviously NO parking problem. :)\n\nWe had a table reserved for about 6 of us and we were seated promptly. The place was JAMPACKED for a weeknight. But everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their meals and their service. It can definitely get pretty damn loud here.\n\nWe ordered tons of different pasta, chicken, seafood and dessert dishes. Everything served family style of course. Everything that came out tasted wonderful. I honestly didn't wanna look like a mcfatty pig in front of some of the executives I was dining with so I kept my portions on my plate pretty small. But when dessert came out...I opted to eat my full slice of cheesecake all to myself AND of course nibble on some of the other dessert plates that were still sitting there in the middle of our table.\n\nOur waiter/waitresses were all very friendly. And service was quite efficient.\n\nWould I dine at this particular Maggiano's again? Hmmm, well I have about a million bookmarked spots to try out, so I probably won't be coming back here anytime soon just due to the fact that I already know it's standard Italian food. But I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's not that adventurous with other types of food and just want to enjoy their night with a hearty dinner at a well-known chain restaurant.
4;If you are looking for a fun playful sushi restaurant Cowfish is the place to go. I have been to the sister restaurant Eez in Birkdale Village. When I heard the owner was opening a new restaurant I had to try the place out.  Remember if you are going to Cowfish to expect a long wait and if you cannot accept that than go early or choose somewhere different. The wait is well worth the delicious food and drinks offered. I ordered a Manhattan from the bar as we waited and this drink was definitely worthy of the cost. It was a very deliciously concocted and as per Manhattan the Maker's Mark was not weak. \n\nTo start dinner we ordered the crab rangoon dip which was amazing. In hindsight we did not need to order this app but it was delicious nonetheless. We the ordered a sushi roll each. Having eaten at Eez we knew that the rolls here are huge but once again little did we know one of the plates was massive! We ordered The Motherload which would have been perfect for my boyfriend and I to share. It had so much fish and was definitely a great value. We also ordered another roll that does not come to mind but we loved everything!\n\nI would definitely recommend The Cowfish however if you live closer to the lake or just want sushi check out Eez by the same folks and you will not be dissapointed.
2;Not too much to say since I have been here 2 times.   Once for dinner and 2nd time for breakfast.\nThe first time I had a sandwich which was decent and priced right.\nthe 2nd time was a couple of weeks ago and I went with a large group for breakfast.  I do not eat early in the day but thought if they had something that appealed to me I may order something.  I did not find anything that I wanted and saw that mostly everything on the menu included potatoes.  If you could only order eggs without all the potatoes, etc.\nI may go back again for either lunch or dinner as the employees were very courteous and friendly.
4;Brilliant little bar. Really friendly staff, and the food was fantastic. The wings are incredible. A must visit! I'll  be back for sure!
2;A normal everyday Albertsons so groceries as well as a meat counter and alcohol section.
2;Some of the employees here make excellent sandwiches and are exceptionally polite, the others...not so much. It's pretty hit or miss depending on who's working when you go. \n\nI like Port of Subs, so I'm happy to have a location near my neighborhood, however I wish the service were more consistent. Both my boyfriend and I have been skimped on veggies so many times, and it's really a frustrating issue when it happens on so many occasions. For me, a sandwich is more about the layers of vegetables and the delicious seasonings with a highlight of cheese, not the other way around, so when I'm offered a few measly slices of tomato it's a little insulting. \n\nI'm not a high-frequency customer because there's also banh mi and salads up the street, so I only find myself motivated to eat here once in awhile given the competition.
2;I postponed writing my review of Tortas Paquime I July since it was my first visit and our experience was 2.5 stars.  Today's visit brought them up to a 3 star rating. \n\nThe Good ~ They use very fresh ingredients, their tortas and variety of postres are very good.  They offer a soup of the day.  The service is friendly and they are fairly quick to make your order.  Their prices are very reasonable and cheaper than most other places that offer the same menu options.  \n\nThe not so Good ~ Their Aguas Frescas are not made fresh to order and tasted very watered down.  The tortas are very good however their Tacos Volteados was more of a melted cheesy tacos than a shredded pork tacos.  They were also a too greasy.  \n\nThe Bad ~ We had to sit on the side of the restaurant that has the TV and it was too loud.  It was playing some kind of Mexican comedy that was not appropriate for the children to watch that were dinning at the time.  It was also very hot in in the restaurant.  I will blame that on the Arizona heat.
1;Had the bucatini & meatballs. The bucatini & sauce were delicious but did not like the meatballs. They had raisins mixed in. I had the large portion & for the price it was way overpriced.
4;"Nevermind the food, this is the spot for dancing!! When going back to my room at 11:30pm leaving a shitty time at Senor Frogs I heard Spanish Rock (Mana). I stopped my husband dead in his tracks and asked him \""do you hear that?! that's where we need to be'!! we followed the music and quickly found the spot and stayed there till 3am! IT WAS GOOD! definitely going back in July!! The DJ played mostly cumbias and a small assortment of reggeton, hip hop and banda!! The spot!!"
1;"Scale of 1-10 (single visit):\n6 Food\n3 *Drinks*\n8 Service\n9 Atmosphere\n7 Value\n\nI am vaguely aware that Switch, FEZ, and Ticoz are all related.  While I very much love FEZ and am looking very forward to checking out Ticoz soon, I can't say I'm impressed with Switch.  Granted, I've only been once and will update this after another go if I can improve the rating.\n\nBut right now it's a 2.  The drinks were blegh and my buffalo chicken sandwich was made with sliced deli-style chicken meat with indistinct flavors from all the elements of the sandwich.  Not what I was expecting and not enjoyable.  The highlight of the food was the bruschetta however - it was very nice.\n\n\""Meh. I've experienced better.\"", the 2-star moniker, is accurate - though I'd would prefer it say \""Meh. I've experienced much better.\""  I'll give it another try before I abandon it though."
1;I see all these 5 star reviews and have to question if they've ever really been to a sushi establishment before. Who knows, maybe it's me.\n\nI was really unimpressed with the food here. For the price we had to pay for small portions and average flavor, there really wasn't much here that one couldn't find better (and for a whole lot less) at another sushi place.\n\nSake wise, the staff was very helpful and knowledgeable in the vast number of choices they have available. If there is one positive redeeming factor to this restaurant it is the sake list. If you love sake then you should definitely check this place out.\n\nDecore and atmosphere wise, it was fabulous. If you plan to try this place definitely make some reservations, you'll most likely need it to get in.\n\nIn the end though this place seems more like a trendy place than of actual substance for it serves. If that's your thing, go for it, otherwise I'd say avoid it. Even the huge variations of sake will not have me attempting to come back anytime in the future.
4;Best place to see a movie - hands down!  Pricey? A bit BUT -- just make sure first to go on-line and sign up/join (it's free - they only want your email addy) and you automatically receive discounts.  So, ok - you pay $9 at the reg. movie theater, right?  At iPic it's $17.50 BUT (don't choke - hear me out) ...... that also includes: free valet parking, free popcorn & m&m's and the luxury, ultra-comfy seating, silk pillow, blanket and someone to wait on you!  You would easily pay $8.50 more for the popcorn & valet alone.  As a working Mom the idea of relaxing with a movie, excellent food & libations and someone else serves, prepares & cleans up is a no-brainer for a great night out!  \n\nNo, it's not really the place for a budget conscious, family night out ---- there are already places for that anyway.  If you want a fabulous date night that's not the same old boring restaurant or night club then give iPic a whirl -- you won't be disappointed!\n \nP.S. I highly recommend the filet mignon sliders - 3 to an order w/chips is more than a filling & elegant movie munch.  With a Cosmo?  Heaven!
1;"Missed happy hour so we sat in the \""lounge\"" at 6:15 for some appetizers. Crab rangoon was tasty, as were the ribs. The sauces to dip them in were bad - hot mustard was too nasaly and the cocktail sauce was just that. Service was nothing to write home about until we tried to use our Groupon and were told we needed to be in the dining room to use it. Since we spent over $50 sitting 5 feet away from the dining room this left a sour taste in my mouth. I thought the idea of using the Groupon program was to get new customers into the restaurant? Unfortunately for them, I'll flush the $ I spent on the groupon itself because I can't make it back there before it expires (next week) and no one at the restaurant/bar/lounge/non-dining-room thought it was important to fill me in on this. Funny... I couldnt tell the difference between the dining room or the \""lounge\"" because for one, there were tables in both sections. For two, both sections were empty, so what the hell does it matter where I sit? Good job Trader Vic's - your Future Sales Prevention Program was a great success today!\n***\nIN RESPONSE TO MANAGEMENT'S COMMENTS BELOW - I did not GO to the BAR during the HAPPY HOUR I went during OFF HOURS and paid FULL PRICE for a plate of fried vittles. GAH."
3;We just got married on the Terrace October 7, 2012! The venue was beautiful! Staff was also very helpful and pleasant, but my family had a hard time not taking their own pictures of us (not permitted inside). The photos are very pricey, but they deffinitely look proffessional! We decided to buy the CD and they even gave us a discount to help us out with funds. The ceremony went very well, and we received details we asked for in the ceremony. We did have a surprise fee of $35 for them to mail our legal certificate, but in all we really enjoyed the services. Thank you !!
4;Went to eat at Daphnes last night with my girlfreind. The food was awesome and the employee's were very helpful. The manager recomended a dinner special. The special was a ton of food for cheap! Got eat!
1;I really wanted this to be great but it was just ok.  The kids are all $5 and my daughter got one slice if French toast and a drink that is not much food for my money.  I got the BLAT, it was good but it says its on Texas toast but mine was on wheat toast.  My husband ordered a hot dog and it was ok but the bun was dried out and covered in a huge pile if grilled onions.\nThe service was slow, but she was nice and friendly.  I don't think we will be going back anytime soon.
4;The best pan roast I have ever had.
1;I don't know why I continue to waste hundreds of dollars at SBE restaurants when I've never liked a single one. I keep hoping they're going to live up to the hype and they never do. The only reason I'm giving them two stars instead of one is that for once, the server didn't act like we were privileged to be dining there like they do all ALL the SBE restaurants in LA. She was actually friendly and nice, not snooty.\n\nFirst, I called for a reservation 10 days in advance after seeing nothing available on the day we wanted (Friday 9/5) on Open Table. The girl on the phone said nothing was available until Tuesday 9/9. A few days later, I looked on Open Table and 8pm on Friday was available so I booked it.\n\nWe get there on time and the place is 70% empty. I wonder if they just keep spaces open for walk-ins, yet they don't tell you that on the phone when you try to make a reservation. The place stayed empty until about 10pm when we left.\n\nWe ordered the foie gras cotton candy, chicken croquettes, beef Carpaccio with parmesan, peanut fed serrano ham, flat iron steak with blue cheese, baby corn,  and Anna potatoes.\n\nThe foie gras, croquettes, carpaccio, and ham were good, not amazing. The flat iron steak was bland, the anna potatoes were so saltly, they were inedible. I sent them back and they still came back covered in salt. They forgot the baby corn and the steak took so long, they sent out a free gazpacho, but that wasn't good either. I didn't realize that they forgot the baby corn until hours later, but at least they didn't charge us for it.\n\nBottom line, go to Animal or Bestia in LA. You'll save a hundred dollars and have much better, creative dishes.
2;"What it love about BWW is that it's open 24 hours, with the kitchen also open all night. I really like their sauces, I suggest the \""wild\"" and the \""parmesan garlic\"". You can play video poker at their bar also. Good staff, good late night food"
3;"Aha! Great place with awesome smoked meat!\n\nThe smoked meat sandwich was great, large portion with great rye bread and slaw. The pickle was too salty and inedible for me. The Reuben's Smoked Meat Pizza was delightful; crispy, thin crust with loads of smoked meat and cheese. Their appetizers are quite mediocre on the other hand, the honey and mustard chicken filets were really dry and crunchy; also the basket were mainly fries and not many chicken.\n\nThe service was average, food came out pretty fast. The ambience was great, especially at night. If possible, try to be seated near the window, the street view is amazing. The food is very pricey, however the portions are quite large.\n\nI have yet to try the legendary Carrot Cake and Smoked Meat Poutine, and I shall do that in the near future."
0;STOP! DO NOT COME HERE? This is the first salon that I actually left without leaving a tip and did NOT feel bad.  the lady that did my pedi did NOT even put a top coat on. She painted on my cuticle and skin.  The young girl that did the mani cut my nails UNEVEN! I now have 3 different legnths, left cuticle hanging on my fingers and when I asked her to put a top coat on my nails, she used an old bottle or something. it is tacky to the touch and uneven. All this for a whopping $42.  NOT to mention the place was filthy! that should have been my first clue.
0;DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!! I  am a landlord and unfortunatley currently out of town and this company totally tried taking advantage of the siutuation! My  AC unit was acting up in 110degree temp and they sent a tech out who totally misquted and later to find out mis diagnosed.  For what they needed to replace they qouted me $1700. I thought this was high so I called 2 other companies through Yelp and the 2 other companies qouted me $1010 and $990. Then when I declined to use them and I told them exactly why, she charged me $195 for 3hrs of examination when it probably took 1hr and that was to call around for parts.  I will never use this company agaion and totally advise anyone to stay away!
2;"Dined here a week before Xmas.  Food was good. We tried the ceviche, green corn enchiladas, and chicken enchiladas.  Ceviche was very flavorful as were the enchiladas.\n\nThe only issue was the initial service.  The restaurant wasn't busy at 6pm , and we were seated inside promptly with menus  Then we proceeded to wait for like 15 mins. Waiters passed by....no acknowledgement.  Finally we flagged someone and asked if we had a waiter.  A waiter or busboy said he'd get someone.  Another 5-6 minutes and our waiter appears.  We mentioned the wait and she apologized but was like \""Oh, I don't know anything about that.  They just told me to come over here.\""   It's true,  she hadn't been one of the many waiters who'd passed us by so I guess they did just pluck her out of the blue.  Plus, she was super nice and the service was very good after that,\n\nIt just made us wonder---is this usual Vegas service?  Cuz right after Chayo, we went to Serendipity for dessert and had the SAME problem.  Hmm.  Very strange."
3;Such a great time here nothing but laughs. Very sexual and sensual and allot\nOf talent. I sat in the middle I don't regenerate how much were the tickets but it was worth it even tho I left early due to personal reasons lol
1;"Not bad as convenience stores go, but I'm spoiled on the QT stores. So yeah...  Officially it s a, \""Meh. I've experienced better.\"""
4;"\""Extremely Cool Without Being Pretentious\""\n\nSecond time at the Vig Uptown.  Brunch.  Just really cool modern surroundings... but not just surface modern, but deep modern aesthetics that just feel comfortable and real.\n\nSat in the atrium type outside, which is really like an inside garage with big windows and air conditioning.  It's like being outside in the best temperature in Phoenix, even if it's over 100 degrees.\n\nFood was very good.  Relatively large portions for an upscale establishment.\n\nMy wife had the $15 salmon, recommended by the server as the best thing on the menu, and it did not disappoint.  Would easily cost 2x at other restaurants, and probably be worth it. \n\nI had the Hangover cure, and it was easily enough food to take home and have for breakfast the next day.  Very tasty for $10.  And I got the $3 spicy bloody mary that came with it, which was one of the best bloody mary's I've ever had.\n\nAt noon, on the Sunday we went, a really nice band came in and played some great acoustic rock, very nice.  \n\nIt was one of the best brunch experiences we've had in Phoenix.\n\nAdd to this the fact that all wine on the menu, if ordered by the bottle, is 50% off, and that's an outstanding deal.\n\nWe'll be back.  I kicked myself for not coming back sooner.  \n\nMy five star is a rating that is influenced by pricing.  I am a cheap bastard with expensive tastes, so I reward a restaurant that I not only feel I had great food, nice ambiance, and good service, but that I got my money's worth.\n\nAnd The Vig Uptown is all that and then some.  I strongly recommend it to all."
1;"This Wing Stop seems like it is trying to be a Buffalo Wild Wings and is failing. Dont get me wrong; I usually love the wings from Wing Stop and its a toss up on which I would like to eat at. I have eaten at several of the Wing Stop locations and have liked them all. Until this one... Service was o.k. They seemed a little slow but it is a lot bigger than their normal store fronts so I will give them that. But my gripe is the wings were nasty. We ordered three different flavors. Medium, hawaiian barbeque and atomic (which are our normal favorites) but they were all blah and seemed to have a ketchupy flavor to them. Hardly any seasoning at all. I really wanted to like this place as I knew my husband would love to continue coming here but neither of us liked the wings and will not be back. At least not to this location."
0;"Wow.  The only agent in non preferred was s-l-o-w, untrained and unable to handle the customer transaction before her.  As I stood in line waiting forever, three agents sat idly and smugly behind the preferred counter, chatting and doing no work whatsoever.  When I asked one of them to help me, all I got was attitude, \""we only handle preferred\"". I replied the sole individual behind the non preferred desk needed help as she clearly did not know what she was doing.  This fell upon deaf ears until I said loudly,  well since I'm not pre-paid nevermind I'll walk next door to Hertz. Only then did someone help me. (10/9, 4:30 pm, on the off chance management cares)."
3;A fine place to grab an expertly crafted sandwich for a reasonable price, a little pretentious but that's west coast living
3;$9 for 24 hours of free rides that's  a shit ton faster, cheaper, and/or more convenient than walking or taking the taxi/deuce.  That works for me. \n\nThe monorail trams run consistent, they are clean (enough), and those weird tv aquariums/race cars on the floors while you wait are entertaining for two reasons: 1) if they actually work and you can race cars or ripple water...or 2) they don't work and you can watch ppl try all day waving their foot over it trying to get it to work..so u can laugh at them (without telling em u just looked as stupid 2 minutes ago)\n\n  My only beef with the monorail is that it drops off and picks up at the back of the casinos..i understand why...but it's still a pain in the ass...and automated speaker..don't give me some bs excuse that u drop off in the back to help us explore the casinos secret areas. \n\n  Las Vegas Monorail you rock...too bad i was too stupid to use you when I did my dumb ass walk from Tropicana to Circus Circus.\n\n~G\n\np.s. To the dude who mooned us through your hotel window at Bally's Friday night, that was funny.
3;"Went here on a weeknight at 6:30PM for dinner. A good crowd but tables were available. There is a bar area and there is also outside seating.\nWaitstaff was friendly and did a good job. Menu has standard tavern fare: burgers, sandwiches, salads. Quality seems pretty good. The atmosphere is nice, too; sporty with lots of memorabilia adorning the walls and customer-written graffiti on the walls and chalkboards but not in a chain-restaurant-flair sort of way.\nI had a buffalo chicken wrap, which was good. Unfortunately, the side item that was included with my meal cost me an extra $1.75 because it was the fruit cup instead of other sides such as fries, tater tots, mac/cheese,or onion rings."
3;It's nice to go to a restaurant that's not part of a chain.\nThe location for this one is a little odd - as it is right behind a gas station. But the inside atmosphere was pleasant. They have a good variety of breakfast and lunch food- and so far, everything I've had there was tasty.
2;The W is a nice place the rooms are small, but both bar locations are a lot fun. it has a very trendy vibe. It's located near Old Town Scottsdale and a huge mall. I enjoyed my stay here, but my credit card information some how got stolen from this place right after I checked in and gave the front desk my credit card for incidentals. All the fraudulent charges were made at the W within hours of me checking in I received a call from my Bank asking about the charges. I did notify the supervisor on duty (he was really nice) and of course there is just no way any one could have my received credit card information from them.  But needless to say someone did get my information. so please if this happens to you let management know.
3;great food and drinks! almond horchata is delicious and good beer.
4;I love everything about this store.  Not only is the staff (I assume it's the owners?) wonderful and kind, but the products are excellent.  My husband and I go frequently to stock up on our olive oils, balsamics and spices.  Their teas are delicious as well.  I would recommend everyone checking this place out for some awesome rubs, teas, oil and vinegars as well as inexpensive kitchen tools!!!
0;"Worst pizza hut. We only go here occasionally because we keep praying it will get better.. It never does.. Worst staff and service... Freaking horrible!! First they \""dropped\"" our pizza and had to make another.. then they forgot to put mushrooms on the next one.. we left a tip and got the hell out of there. Management should be ashamed! Your staff is horrible and racists! We will NEVER return.. this time just was the last straw."
4;Best food, best service, best atmosphere - this place has it all.  My family and I go often and are never disappointed.\nThe only Mexican food place we go to  now to get our spice fix!
3;This is a good place to stick up on water and other essentials. It's pricier than the CVS at home, but they make up for it with a wide selection of the types of products a Vegas visit requires (water, sunscreen, water, meds, water...dang, I'm getting thirsty).\n\nI highly recommend the self-scan option during checkout.
0;"What a nightmare. I chose Executive Las Vegas because the hotel I stayed at (MGM Grand) recommended them. Their fares are super cheap ($6), and while I had no qualms with the ride from the airport to MGM, the return trip was abysmal. I called a day in advance to arrange my pick-up. I had a 6:50 am flight, and the lady making my reservation said I should take a 4 am shuttle. I thought that was a completely unnecessary amount of time (considering the airport is literally 4 minutes from MGM) and she reminded me that as a shared ride, we'd be picking up other passengers. She said total time should not exceed 45 minutes, so doing some quick math I conceded and said I'd take the 4:30 am shuttle. \n\nAt 4:25 am on a Monday, I began my wait outside the MGM. While I was not the only person waiting for a shuttle, I was the only person waiting for Executive. I saw person after person getting picked up - ON TIME - by their shuttle services. At 4:45 - now 15 minutes after my arranged pick-up time, I called Executive to see what was up. The gal dispatcher I spoke with (Amber?) notified me that they were running late and would be no more than 10 minutes away. I said ok, and continued to wait. More fellow MGM guests got in their shuttles and drove away. \n\nTime passed, and at 5:01 (now 30+ min late), I called back. Amber told me that, whoops, the van broke down (!??!?!) and they had to send a replacement. I was really feeling discouraged at this time because Executive HAD my cell # (needed it when the reservation was made) and I thought the decent thing they could do is call me and notify me themselves. She assured me that a new van would be there in 5 minutes and would take me and me only directly to the airport. She even told me the van would not be one of their usual ones - with checkerboard and a pin-up gal picture on the front - so that is what I started looking for. Time passed.....and finally, at 5:20 - fifty minutes after my confirmed reservation time - an Executive van showed up (not the \""different\"" one described by the dispatcher however). When I approached the driver, I told him how long I had been waiting and said I was assured there would be no further stops. He got uppity with me and proclaimed he had only just started his shift so nothing was his fault. Sigh. \n\nI did get to the airport on time, but if I ever have to be in Las Vegas again (hopefully not), I think I'll opt for a taxi."
4;Kailyn's Diner is the best. We went there for breakfast and it was amazing. I had the all American breakfast, the potatoes were roasted perfectly and seasoned to perfection. Eggs(over easy ) were tender and creamy with the crispy bacon. \nMy husband had the Pile Up. It was a mound of hash browns with bacon and sausage gravy and eggs piled high. The gravy is to die for. \nWe also had the expresso pancakes which were very unique and delicious.  Never had anything like this and we eat out a lot. \nTo finish it all off my son ordered the Kailyn's deep fried cookie dough with bacon. I could eat that all day. It's was the best.  This was such a wonderful experience. Definitely a place to eat and the prices were so reasonable. One of the most enjoyable meals.\n\nI would go back again.
1;Tip jar in the drive-thru window....real bad form! It's time the franchise management to make some changes.
1;Went for Restaurant week on 9/21, the food and presentation were good.  Most unhappy that they added a gratuity of 29% for a party of 4.  Absolutely ridiculous and will not go back.
1;Overpriced breakfast, especially for a cafe. Most of the breakfast items ranged from about $15-20 on average and the quality of the food wasn't as great. With that price, I can head out to a breakfast buffet and stuff myself until I get a food coma.
3;A friend saw a deal for Side Door on Groupon, so we figured that we'd check it out. The place was pretty empty, and we were seated right away. The inside was kind of generic looking, and the decor wasn't great. It's the kind of place you'd go with a group of friends to enjoy some beers and burgers.\n\nThe menu had typical pub food and a pretty extensive beer selection. I split the BBQ chicken flatbread and the Side Door burger with a friend and it was way too much food! I think we would have been fine sharing just one entree. The burger was delicious, and the fries were well seasoned and crispy. The BBQ chicken flatbread was good but had a lot going on. \n\nThe prices were fair, even without the Groupon. I'd come back again.
1;Great potential, but they need to make some changes.  The food and the service could definitely be improved (I guess that coversjust about everything...lol).  After you're seated, you need to keep an eye on your server in order to get additional coffee, utensils, condiments, and even the bill.  The table behind us had to get their own utensils and condiments.  \n\nNow, the food has potential but I'm not sure about the cook.  The home fires are too greasy, the toast is only toasted on one side, and the over medium eggs  were cooked the same as you would cook them for a fried egg sandwich.  And to top it off, the food was lukewarm.  Don't the cooks every taste their own food ?\n\nSo, as I said before, they have the potential to be rated 4/5 stars, but currently, I can only give them a 2.
2;"After all the hype and raves, I have to say that the Bellagio dinner buffet (our first meal in Vegas), was a big disappointment.  I felt that the food selection was a little weak and the flavors and quality on the low end of the scale.  The only thing that made up for the lack of good hot food was the amazing dessert bar, which featured some insanely good desserts.\n\nHonestly, I can't remember much of what I had, because most of it tended to be over-cooked.  The only thing that was really good was the fresh lamb/beef gyros, which were carved straight off the rotating, vertical spit.  Unfortunately, the meat was ready only every 10-15 minutes (an eternity at a buffet) and there wasn't much of it each time they carved it.  You had to be fast, or the meat would run out.  Extra points for having mini-pitas and a full bar of condiments, such as sliced tomatoes, lettuce, tzatziki, and crumbled feta cheese.  I also appreciated their sushi bar, which had tuna poke and tuna sashimi, which was fresh and very good.    \n\nBellagio's carving station offered a large variety of meats, from the standard prime rib and lamb to more \""exotic\"" fare, such as bison and beef wellington, which later turned into chicken wellington.  I tried the prime rib, the bison, and the beef wellington, all of which were lacking in flavor.  The prime rib was a tad overdone, even from the center, and the seasoning, which made for a good tasting crust, didn't penetrate to the center of the meat.  The bison and beef wellington were both tough and over-cooked.  It was my first time trying bison and while I think it had potential, it was just too tough for me to enjoy.  Likewise, the beef wellington, which had a good pastry crust, was too dry.\n\nAnd now for the desserts, which were all delicious.  The creme brulee, which I had 3 of (yes, I know, I'm a pig), came with a perfectly crisp, carmelized crust, which I delighted in cracking with my spoon.  Delicious.  Next up was a key lime pie - it was deliciously tart and smooth.  Likewise, the lemon meringue pie was amazing, with a nicely browned meringue on top.  There were other desserts as well, all of which were good, presumably because the man behind Jean Philippe Patisserie is overseeing all the desserts at the Bellagio.\n\nAll in all, an okay buffet.  The desserts were outstanding, but the other foods were a disappointment.  If you can eat $35+ worth of pastries and perhaps nibbles of sushi, gyro, cocktail shrimp, and pasta, then Bellagio is the place to go.  Otherwise, for a more complete, overall Vegas buffet experience, I would head out to the Wynn, Paris, or Mandalay Bay."
0;Not gun friendly!
3;I used to avoid this place like the plague.  KFC? That's unhealthy!  Long John Silvers? Forget about it!  \n\nNut not really if you do your research.  The Grilled Chicken Breast and the Green Beans are a great choice.  Always a good option when you want to change it up a bit.\n\nI've been here a few times in the past five years and wasn't impressed.  For my past two recent visits it wasn't too bad.  The place isn't crowded when I come for lunch and the employees are super friendly.  The place is clean, the food comes out hot.  \n\nThey have Pepsi Products: Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, Pepsi Max, Tropicana Pink Lemonade...\n\nI'll come here again.  It's going in my work lunch rotation for sure.
0;"Love the Tempe store, but not this one. Felt stupid walking up to the counter with bags of clothes, the lady at the consignment counter just stared at me and asked me \""how she can help\"" I'm obviously there to consign so I start explaining that and she states they only take appointments and hands me a piece of paper to read on how consigning works...very horrible customer experience at this store. It was my first time trying to consign and she made me feel very stupid about it..."
0;Mussels didn't live up to description. Food was plain even though I ordered my dishes spicy. Totally Americanized, which means it's more bland. Waitress was pleasant & the atmosphere was nice. But for flavor it totally failed.
0;I can back up Kendra's statement about the menus as well. We had to wait ten minutes for a menu because there were non available.
0;"I would give a ZERO stars if it was an option.  During my recent trip to Vegas with family my husband and I planned a trip to lucky strike.  We called about a week in advance to see if we could use a free bowling coupon that we had from another location.  The hostess said it was fine.  When we arrived the same hostess had to speak with the manager on how to put the coupon in the system.  It all seemed fine.  We were given shoes and a lane.  We got all ready and the same manager comes over and says \""Oh sorry you can't use the coupon here, but you can stay and bowl for the regular price\""  Please we walked out and took our money to a different casino.  I can see why the place was practically empty when we were in there.  I like the Chicago locations much better"
3;"Yayyy =) I'm a fan.\nNot only of the desserts (sugar) but, THE FOOD!!!\n\nThe menu is extensive and is, literally, a book. Kinda reminds me of the menu/book at Cheesecake Factory. YES; THAT much food!\nHad the crepes with chicken, feta, and spinach. And nooooOOoo, I wasn't on a diet kick, I just like those ingredients.\nFriend had the turkey club crepe; and another friend had the chicken and waffles.\n\nThe crepes were good but, after having tried the chicken and waffles; I wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiish, I had gotten something more substantial like their pastas or their bigger entrees.\n\nI know one of the chef's there so, he comped us our dessert(s). Plural =)\nHad the banana split sundae and the...get this: \""everything chocolate pizza,\"" which was dark choco syrup, chips, brownies....ughhhhh, it was delicious.\n\nThe service was spectacular. Our server was soooooo nice. And when he didn't bring my drink in a timely manner because he forgot; he bought my next drink. Amazing =)\n\nBLOWS SERENDIPITY AWAY!!!!!\n\n\np.s. It's open 24/7. Thank me later."
4;I've been here several times and their service is top notch!  I would recommend their chicken parm, and the Gorgonzola gnocchi.  Excellent place for a date with your significant other!
3;"The NC Music Factory is a great venue.  From the time you exit the highway...and see the inviting light sculptures along Seaboard, you get the impression you are headed to something good.  You pass the great restaurants and clubs...and can park within 1/2 block or less from the entrance.   The atmoshere for jazz concerts has been great.  You have choice of lawn seating, VIP and non VIP.  The sound quality from any location of the venue is great.  So my preference is defined by my \""5-Row\"" rule.  If I can be within 5 rows of the stage...I am good.  I enjoy attending this venue!"
1;Pro:\nLovely ambiance, and Service staff. Felt like and upper end restaurant, something which typical Vietnamese restaurants do not offer\n\nCons:\nWell the food was insipid and bland. The pho tasted like salted water with a touch of broth. The condiments like sweet basil etc were dry and flaccid. I would hope that Nam pla was a default accoutrement for most authentic Vietnamese restaurants. I counted 3 meatballs and a few slivers of the rare beef pieces. The quantity was smaller than most other ones I have tasted in the area. Ah well I don't feel too bad as I can trundle on down to Saigon Pho for the better deal and food
3;Typically, I am wary of establishments that put the words: best, tasty or even yummy in their name. However, Ingo you are quite the exception!\n\nHaving breakfast at their sister store, La Grande Orange, across the street before it was an absolute must to visit Ingo's if you love their food. Instead of fresh juice, pizzas and crepes Ingo's provides grass-fed beef burgers, healthy apps and a good variety of wine and beer (some coming from CA) to cause some CA nostalgia.\n\nSince I was dining with my roommate we decided to sit out on the patio and to share a meal with a couple of items so we could see what Ingo had to offer. We decided to start with the Hummus and Pumpkin Seed Guacamole served with crudites as our appetizer, the Paris, Texas burger to share and to drink the Black Market Hefeweizen and the Lyric By Etude Pinot Noir.\n\nHummus and Pumpkin Seed Guac- pretty large portion app for two people to share, good creamy hummus, with slight heat, thick consistency, the Pumpkin Seed Guac was not my fave, but it was all a personal preference. Comes with cauliflower, cucumbers, carrots, celery and golden beets.\n\nParis, Texas Burger- Really good burger, cooked well, juicy, love how the sharp cheddar cheese came through, crispy bacon, slight sweetness from the BBQ sauce and the pickles were awesome! They crisp the interior of the buns giving a good texturally crunch contrasting the soft, airiness of the outer bun.\n\nBlack Market Hefeweizen- Fruity, light, refreshing. I could drink this all night.\nLyric By Etude Pinot Noir- Apparently acidic, tangy, berry flavor, spicy and tannic.\n\nGreat service through out the night, lovely atmosphere inside and out and awesome food! Definitely will be back to try their other burgers, the rest of the drink list and hell, I just realized they carry dessert here. Hold that last thought, I'm on my way back already!
2;Ordered the grape leaves appetizer + lamb/beef shawarma plate with rice and vegetables (the other option was pita/hummus). The plate came with a side choice of soup or salad - we went with lentil soup. After tax the total was $16 something. A bit on the pricey side compared to places like this in the northern suburbs of Chicago but the food was tasty and the crowd was diverse. I would have preferred everything to be a little less salty. For 2 people that was enough food. We left very full, satisfied, and thirsty. I would come back to try their sandwiches.
3;Get the 24hr pass definitely worth it. Ribs not great, salmon dry, Mongolian good just not with beef if you are like me you like your beef well done. Gelatto yummm! Brunch they have these fully loaded mash potatoes absolutely delish. Eggs pretty good as well. Churros are decent but not great. Just get there with plenty enough time b/c the line can get pretty big.
3;I have been coming to this store for many ,many years now. \nIt is open 24 hours a day. I know that for sure, once I had to get my girlfriend pantyhose for work @3:30 am.\nIt has a Pharmacy,with a drive thru. Which I still find odd for Drive in drugs. \nBut,I guess it is good if you have sick children in the car.\nIt has a really good selection on everything, you can even buy food here.\nCleaning supplie, laundry products,etc.\n\nThey have a great little photo dept. as well you can get photos developed as well as reprints and movies, even copies of photos that are 30 years old.\nWhat more could you want?\nThey have great sales all the time, every week and the have a CVS reward card, let me tell you this card is well worth the time it takes to use it.\nLots of savings here for sure.\nThere are 2 ways to get into the parking lot here as well. One from Rural and the other from Southern. Nice big parking lot. \nWith a few Pan handlers of course.
3;Dr. Caroline Pierce is my primary physician at Mecklenburg Medical Group, and she's awesome. She makes you feel very comfortable and at ease, and you can tell she actually cares. Usually at the start of each appointment, she comes in to talk to me about why I'm there, etc., before examining me. One time I had a serious health problem and she helped get me into CMC quickly for some tests, so I didn't have to wait in the ER. Then she called me later that day with the results, which was impressive. The staff at her office isn't always the friendliest, but if I call with an urgent need for an appointment, they always figure out a way to get me in.
3;I absolutely love this place. I had Nick do a mani/pedi for me. I have tried a lot of different salons in Vegas, and this was potentially the best experience I've had. Nick took his time, and paid attention to detail. He also took the initiative to do extra. My only complaint is that I thought the prices were a little higher than most salons, by about 5-10 dollars. You could easily spend $100 on a service.
2;2 for 1 pints on Wednesdays is the only reason I frequent this place. It gets really crowded on this night especially when the students are in town, and it can be really fun. However, their prices have been creeping up over the years and their beers have gone downhill in terms of quality. The atmosphere is fun - large and open with bar seating - but the bathrooms are really disgusting and the bartenders, especially one I have in mind, are usually wasted. The bottom line: fun on Wednesdays for young 20-somethings where you can get 2 pints of gross to mediocre beer for $9.75.
3;Lovely, bright caf\u00e9 with a relaxed and friendly vibe. I stopped in for lunch and had an amazing sprouts salad, which was served with two slices of toasted homemade bread. I thought it tasted amazing, and 3/4 of the way through I saw the dressing hidden behind the bowl, added it, and the salad was even more amazing with the dressing. \n\nI branched out a bit and tried the lavender latt\u00e9 ... ce n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 mon go\u00fbt. Next time I'll stick with the standard kind. I was intrigued by the chocolate chai latt\u00e9 but it wasn't available dairy-free, so please try it for me and let me know how it is.\n\nTheir baked goods looked delish but I had used up my budget on lunch & coffee. Another time.
3;"9/18\n\nChecked out their happy hour- select apps $2.95 each!  However, no specials on the alcoholic beverages, with a quick glance at the wines-by-the-glass revealing prices of about $9 and up.  Thank goodness Total Wine and More was holding its grand opening (w/ a penny wine-tasting!) that day... Violeta and I decided to try a few apps here and then head straight to Total Wine for the liquid component :)\n\nI should make a correction to the last statement above- it was I that tried a few apps- the Sliced steak brushetta and the Brio brushetta quattro,\"" while Violeta H. tried the Margherita flatbread.  My apps were both outstanding!  I could probably be satisfied w/ two orders of the steak brushetta (loved that Tuscan Italian dressing!), while an order of the brushetta quattro would suffice (it's their burger, quartered, and a side of homemade potato chips).  While I had my hands full w/ the two apps AND their great sourdough table bread (there were also some great-looking seeded crackers/flatbread, too, but I couldn't try it due to food allergies), Violeta confided that she loved her Margherita flatbread.  \n\nBrio Tuscan Grille's happy hour, despite the lack of discounted beverages, provides impressive hors d'oeuvres at exceptional value.  I'll definitely visit again =)"
0;Buffet sucks. Its like a bunch of cafeteria food served in warming dishes. Definitely not going to repeat.
0;Very bad comunication...after a year of nothing from them i called to find out my ticket was never filed and was dissmised.....at that point i wasnt refunded any mony...thanks for taking my money and not doing a thing
1;"I really wasn't that impressed.  Plastic table cloth and the place smelled kind funky too.  I got the bone in ribeye - and it definetely wasn't the best steak in the area.  Wine selection is rather lacking.  I'd hit the many alternatives before this; Flemings, Capital, Ruth..."
0;This was an incredibly overrated restaurant. We chose it because of high marks on yelp. We started with mushroom soup which was salty brown water with a vague mushroom flavor. We sent it back and got a beet salad which was fine. To be fair my main course of trout was good. The cioppino my son and husband had was the worst we had ever ordered. It was supposedly a main course but was quite small. The shrimp were tiny with a few pieces of shell fish and a very small piece of fish in a watery, red broth without any character. My son went next door to order a pizza so that he would have something to eat. The bill was $120.00, and we felt incredibly ripped off.
3;That I have dined here twice in one year, is testimony to the fact that if you don't dine here while you are in Vegas, you are losing out on fine food & a good experience.\n\nBut you need to make sure you have enough money, lest you be eating Ramen for a while...\n\nWith regards to the food, what's not to like?!\nPaella - good.\nSangria - good.\nMushroom risotto - good.\n\nWait, tapas here in general, good :)
0;Every time I ate at Garcia's, I got sick.  The last time I ate there, my appendix burst. No joke. A few years after my near-fatal experience, a friend of mine ate there and the next day her appendix burst!\n\n Avoid this restaurant like the plague.   Unless you enjoy going septic, that is.
1;"hostess is nice, server was ehh... Managers way of greeting a table is in a rush and with no smile asking \""How is everything\"" as he is rushing past your table...."
3;Yummy food, reasonable prices....need I say more?
3;I can't complain about the food. Everything was pretty good... the hummus, yogurt with cucumber dip, falafel, steak kabobs. The kabob was a huge serving that my wife and  split and couldn't finish. The quality of the meat was good and correctly cooked to the requested temp. It didn't come with Basmati rice, but did have rice pilaf with a wonderful butteriness to it.\n\nTheir menu is ridiculously large with cuisines including Italian, Mediterranean, Persian, Greek, and Indian. In my opinion they'd be better off with a more focused menu, but I guess they have to do what they can to attract the most customers. They even have a kid's menu with all the typical kid stuff. \n\nService was decent and prices were ok. The interior looks a little dated but it was comfortable enough.
4;Finally, some great pizza in the south end area.  The pizza is awesome, New York thin crust and its a great atmosphere.  The beer prices are a little high in my opinion but its still a great place.  The people are really nice and we enjoy going back there all the time.
2;Chicken and pork were a bit dry. Margaritas and guacamole were overpriced. Food was still good borderline great. Authentic. Will go back....I think.
2;As a chocoholic, I was looking forward to try this place. But out of four lunch and dinner dishes and three desserts I tried so far, nothing seemed worth raving about. Perhaps brunch is better? Guess I'll have to give them another chance...
1;The only reason I'm giving this a 2 stars is because of their delicious salmon burger. \nOther than that, the service sucked, portions were extremely small, a 15$ salad only included lettuce, cucumbers and shredded carrots. The fries ordered were soggy and also small portion. \nOverall very disappointed.
2;Stopped by for lunch with a friend one weekday afternoon. I'd heard him talk about this place a few times as its' close to his office so I had high hopes. It's very latin themed when you walk in, bright and cheery colors. I would describe it as a closer to authentic Chipotle. They have burritos, tacos, enchiladas, etc. and you make your meat selection and choose your sides. I had the taco combo with fire grilled chicken, rice, and beans. My mouth started watering as I saw them hand making the tortillas. I paid for our meals, stopped by the drinks and got some horchata (they're selection of jugos looked great), grabbed a seat and dug in. I really liked the tacos. I've never had Chipotle's tacos but these were a mix between street tacos and your taco bell fare, and I thought they were great. The rice and beans were okay. I wish there was one closer to where I live but I'll definitely return.
4;Mob museum is very well thought out. You work your way down from the 3rd floor and it's very interactive. My girlfriend and I had a good time here. Very educational and cool at the same time. You may want to split the tour in half because it's said to take approx 3hrs and from what I remember you can go out n come back as long as you have your wristband on. Check on that prior! It shares history in a historical building! A must when your in Vegas to learn about old Vegas.
2;Atmosphere is hip. Service is very good. Music a little loud. We each had a crispy fish taco. Notice I said taco... not tacos. We expected a little more food based on the price. The tacos here are pretty small. The taco was good but too watery (don't know what that juice was dripping all over my plate). Chips are ok, salsa ok. When I compare what I get from the popular local fast food fish taco place and other Mexican restaurants I have to wonder if this business plan will work.\n\nQuality is ok. Too expensive for what you get. I don't mind spending the money if I feel I am getting my money's worth. Don't know if we will go back or not... probably not.
1;Drove by one Saturday night after 11 pm with the intent of stopping in to check it out but didn't go in because the doors were wide open and they were blaring hip hop.  I'm too old and deaf already for that scene...
3;"The Slider Truck has garnered some immediate successes upon their opening early this summer, and well worth it.  You can't help but notice their truck as they go sliding on through!  It's completely painted brightly with cartoon-like images.\n\nMy first experience with them was after the Las Vegas AIDS Walk where we had the Slider Truck pretty much to ourselves.  There was no wait really to put in our order, so that was definitely something we appreciated.  At the time, they were still experimenting with different burgers, so we only had a few to choose from.\n\nOne thing we did like from the start was the Pep Pep, which has sauteed onions, crisp bacon, fresh lettuce and tomato, melted cheese on top of a juicy patty along with their super sauce.\n\nThey also had the Pulled Porkie during that time, which has layers of pork on top of the toasted buns.  \n\nWe also tried the Barbie had cheese and bacon over the burger, along with plenty of barbecue sauce.\n\nFor the price you pay, there is definitely a lot of meat in between those two buns and it's a moist burger too.  We've paid more for a lot less - quantity and taste-wise, so this was a welcome addition to Vegas.\n\nOur next experience was on a Friday night and long lines were known to be found where the Slider Truck was.  In this case, there was indeed a line, but it was really the people gathering and waiting for their burgers.  It was a good 45 minutes before we got our burgers.  Ric came out from the truck to apologize for the long wait and some kid piped up, \""It's worth the wait!\""  That pretty much sums it up!\n\nOverall, we love the Slider Truck and the idea behind it.  Sure, waiting 45 minutes for a burger brings the wait for truck food to a whole new level.  We'll keep our eyes out for this truck, but we'll have to watch our clock too at the same time.  We definitely want to see Ric and his crew do well.  Owners who care about their customers and are genuinely excited about what they are doing is something we should all support!"
4;Best local Thai food hands down! I recommend Kung Pow with steamed tofu and additional pineapple.
1;2 words for you.. FIVE GUYS... Best burger ever.. Flame burger not good. The bun was soggy... The burger flavorless.  The waffle fries also soggy.. Maybe they should change their name to soggy burger! Not impressed. Five guys is the place to go for Amazing!
4;One of my favorite sushi restaurants.  Always fresh fish with great culinary skills.  Staff is friendly and attentive.
4;I've seen Mystere and Ka, but this show blows them both out of the water!\n\nTHE BEST SHOW I'VE EVER SEEN! And I'm into arts and entertainment, so I've seen quite a few amazing shows.\n\nWe purchased discounted seats (front row) at Tickets4Tonight - which I highly recommended if you are looking for last minute discounted shows and dinners. But there are no bad seats in this venue (theater of the round).\n \nI cried about 5 times (no, I wasn't drunk). It was just such a beautiful show.\n\nIn the end, Sgt. Pepper came out and handed me and another audience member a rose (I nearly died).\n\nIt really hits home if you're a Beatles fan, and if not... you will still absolutely love this show!
2;Who doesn't like grilled cheese? I think we all have fond memories eating this gooey goodness..\nI had so many expectations for this one of a kind restaurant. However, I was disappointed with the outcome. I ordered The Executive, which came with muenster cheese, avocado and grilled onions..\nI put some thought into what didn't work for me, and I can simply say there was no flavor to combine the ingredients. Also, the cheese wasn't gooey and melted, it HAD been melted and was just a coagulated clump by the time you bit into it.\nIt could be the type of cheese or combination they are using.\nThe curly fries on the flip side were abundant and nicely fried.\n\nI think I'll pass on this one though.. Too little time, too much to eat.
2;Could the location be any better? No. It's a gorgeous location & very convenient parking.  Everyone I purchased from had a cell phone credit card thingey, so I was able to use my card (VERY HANDY DANDY)!!\n\n86'd  Eats is gluten-free Amazingness, the Tzatziki was to die for!!!!!!!  Along with Sorelle Dressings, who offered  Vegetarian Gluten-Free dressings.\nI also enjoyed the dude selling humming bird feeders, they were so cute!!!!!\n\nThis location is mostly arts & crafts with a few food vendors throw in there and really no fresh produce.  There was one farm but it wasn't organic, so sad, too bad. \n\nI'll just go back for 86'd & Sorelle :)
4;First visit tonight.  Was reassured when I saw how packed the place was. A little tucked away place with the most awesome sushi ever!  My family has decided they didn't want to go to any other sushi restaurant but this one. Sushi was fabulous!  My ears perked up when I heard the sushi chefs speaking to each other in Japanese!  I haven't heard that since my childhood in Japan!  Explains why the sushi was so good- it is authentic. Going back tomorrow per family's request!
1;"Walking up to this place, you'd think there was no other place in town for breakfast.  We had very high hopes just based on the amount of people waiting to be seated.  Unfortunately, our hopes were dashed after eating.  \n\nFirst of all, as far as service is concerned, they rate high.  This place was C-ROW-DED! My husband and I and our toddler were seated outside on the patio about 20 minutes after we arrived.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive.\n\nAs far as the food is concerned?  Blah!!  I ordered the California Benedict.  The English muffin was toasted which was nice, but everything else was bland as can be.  I asked the waitress to request my eggs poached \""medium\"".  One thing having a kid will do to you is change some food habits.  I haven't been able to eat runny eggs since I was pregnant.  \""Sure\"" she said with a happy smile.  One egg was completely undercooked, the other was completely OVERcooked... no happy medium.  The hollandaise must have been from a packet.  It had no flavor whatsoever.  Same with the potatoes.  Bland.  Boring.  Yuck.  \n\nMy husband had the chicken friend steak.  Like the hollandaise, he was certain the gravy was straight out of a packet.  \n\nIt's so rare that we get out for breakfast, let alone a benedict or chicken fried steak sort of breakfast.  I misjudged the long lines outside and the relatively steep prices.  I don't mind paying $25 for breakfast for two if it's worth it.  But U.S. Egg was definately not worth it."
2;I'm a sucker for the boneless wings. Great variety of sauces (and now dry seasoning!) for wings, with and without bones. Tuesdays are 50 cent wing nights, I think. Thursdays are 60 cent boneless wing nights, for sure. The other foods are fine. I'm partial to the Southwest Chicken Wrap.\n\nThe service can be a bit slow, especially when there's a football game on. \n\nI would be remiss if I didn't warn you that your stomach will not be happy with you after your meal.
2;Tix 4 tonight is a great value for show tickets. They have several locations on the strip and downtown.
1;Happy new year to you too!!! Kid working there was sooo rude! It's probably my fault for interrupting whatever he was doing. Or maybe getting a smog check on Jan 2 when everyone should be asleep
1;I think I got the wrong thing..\nI got a chicken salad on french..the half...with a drink\ncame out to 8$ for about a 5in sandwich..\nhella weak in my book..\ni saw people with huge pastrami, and roast beef...mine was just tiny..\nill stick to corporate subway
1;Not the newest or greatest or cheapest. But if your in the mood for roller skating, it's there.
3;If you live in or by planet Hollywood, you must go to Earl of Sandwiches for a $6 sandwich!! It's awesome. I tried the club, full monague, and tuna melt. I must say my favorite was the tuna melt. It doesn't come with anything but the melted cheese and tuna goodness on a toasty bread bun, but you can ask them to add lettuce and tomato for free! \n\nI loved their soups too. Tomato bisque and broccoli cheddar were both delicious. I think over our weekend in Vegas, for every meal and late night snack, our group of 16 always had someone that went to Earl's. It's quick, cheap, and good! It's open 24 hours too. \n\nAlmost makes it ok that we stayed so far down the strip from grand lux :)
1;Only the fifth time I've visited this dog park. It's small with lots of shade trees, separate small and large dog areas, bench seating, dog watering fountains, plenty of entrances/exits, good parking and well-stocked poop bag dispensers. Dog owners  seem conscientious about picking up the poop. It is a little dark at night. My dogs and I have met several wonderful dogs during our visits. My biggest complaint is about the terrain. The ground is uneven and the roots from most of the trees are exposed and a tripping hazard for people and dogs. The City needs to add several inches of topsoil to level the ground and cover the tree roots.
3;Newly remodeled and it has been offering special rates for quite some time! Appearance looks much more modern and trendy than it used to...still on the small side compared to other hotels, but not bad! The dingy smoke smell is gone as well, and ventilation is much better!
4;This place is off the hook good!  We've visited many times and every single time, everything we order is awesome.  Their soups are great, the salads are awesome.  Pad Thai noodle is perfect, curries are great.  This is one excellent place to visit if you are craving good thai food in Vegas.
4;The mall was pretty big, it was indoor mall and cool inside. They have 2 food courts, and other snacks place like dunkin and pretzel. They have all the sport retail store that I most liked, and they have basic stores like other outlets mall
3;I love staying at the Wynn/Encore, but this one of the few places to eat at the Wynn that isn't grossly overated. Service was spotty but the food was well above average. We had a nice late dinnerl at a reasonable price that included several stiff drinks.  We sampled:\n\nSunny side duck egg w/Jamon and Serrano asparagus: Nothing special. It wasn't possible to determine if the ham was Jamon or procutto (big difference) because the egg dominated the flavor. Not well balanced. \n\nBacon wrapped dates: I try these at every Tapas joint. These don't disappoint and made a perfect desert to our meal. \n\nSalt roasted beets, whipped goat cheese and pistachios: nicely presented, with a balanced pallets of flavors. A nice rendition of a common tapas dish. \n\nSliced sirloin steak with a mushroom fondue and cippolini onions: easily the best dish we tried. The steak was cooked to perfection and the mushroom fondue had a rich smokey flavor.
2;"Meeeehhhhh...  Two coffees, one orange juice, might I add), a side order of toast, a side order of bacon, one chocolate croissant and a side order with 2 scrambled eggs.   How much, y'think?   Yeah, $36!!!   I don't f***ing think so.\n\nThe orange juice was ok, but certainly was not fresh squeezed.  I'm thinking it's coming straight out of the minute maid bottle.   The coffee tasted very light though was very efficient, so my wife were actually thinking that they served caffeine water with black coloring.   In other words, it got us all jittery and wiry, but it didn't taste like coffee.  The eggs were cooked rather poorly, the bacon didn't look all that appetizing (didn't try it though), and the chocolate croissant, for it being \""Le Cafe Ile Saint Louis\"", was really tragic.\n\nNow had all this been priced at the cost Denny's would have charged us, I'd probably give them 4.5 or 5 stars and wouldn't complain one bit.  Certainly the food I had did not outshine Denny's at all.   But $36 for this (ok ok... $30 + 20% tip, but still!!!)   No, some Parisian's seriously smoking crack on the Ile St Louis if he thinks that this is competitive pricing.\n\nI'll give 'em 3 stars because everything in Vegas has become overprice, but let's just say I'd more likely show a smile than shed a tear if I ever heard that this place went \""Au Revoir!\"""
4;"First timer & I must say what a find! When we got there the waitress was nice & even took the time to \""tour\"" the menu with us. I ordered 2 carne asada tacos, one pork & one shrimp. They were amazing. I also had a tres leches for dessert. It was more like a shortbread style. But still good. All in all can't wait to come back!! Oh yea try the guacamole, great way to start your meal off right."
4;"Went and checked out the new iPic Theatres at the Scottsdale Quarter tonight for their mock opening. This place is insane...it's like the W Scottsdale mixed with a movie theatre. \n\nFirst, the seats. Wow. They are unbelievably plush, and they recline. Each has a swiveling table to place your drink/food on which is served by one of many waiters. You get a blanket or pillow if you wish and a \""free\"" popcorn plus valet parking. I say \""free\"" because tickets are $25 once they open this Friday.\n\nThey are doing free movies and food (sliders, flatbreads, salads) and drinks (cocktails, beers, wine) Monday and Tuesday but you have to make reservations. Seriously check it out."
0;This place sucks!!!! It took 45 min to get a ford ranger cleaned! And there was only 6 cars in the entire place! Staff were all joking around and goofing off instead of cleaning the 6 cars on the line! Vacuum job sucked and the interior window was just a smear of dirt! I will never come back here!
1;Let me keep this short and simple, I have a buisness account there and I get treated poorly. Just crappy customer service. Its seriously pathetic. They have TONS of people walking around the store, but nobody can help and if you are in a rush, dont stop by there. Its the worst customer service. I guess I seemed lost, the guy that was delivering ink helped me and was the nicest person in there I met... Sad... I am in there TOO much for that, guess we need to switch accounts. However, the online part of Staples is GREAT!
1;"Not a fan of big casino hotels but I didn't have a choice on this one. The line for check-in was enormous, as was the line to store baggage. It took more than 30 minutes to drop off a bag (and 30 minutes more to pick it up) while waiting for my room.\n\nThe room is extremely dark. Good thing I don't wear makeup because you couldn't see anything in the bathroom. Could barely see the soap I showered with. The lights at the night stand were both out and the alarm was left on (check these things, people!) so I had a friendly 5:37 a.m. wakeup buzz.\n\nThe mandatory resort fee was $22 per night or so, and didn't include a seat by the pool, which requires that you spend wads of cash on food and drink for the privilege of sitting on a chair. I was shooed away at 10:30 a.m. when no one else was there because I wouldn't plunk down the cash.\n\nThe \""free\"" pool closes at 6 p.m. Stupid, like the hours for the gym, which is only open from like 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.\n\nThe big deal-breaker is that they don't have coffee makers in the room, like most casino hotels. I always thought that a hotel in Vegas with a coffee maker and bright lights in the rooms could make a fortune.\n\nP.S. Not impressed by the rock-and-roll memorabilia."
4;"I called Vladimir after finding him on Yelp for a washing machine issue. The clutch was going out on it. Vladimir called me back with the price of the part, $375. I told him to get it and come on out. He made an appointment with me, was on time, looked at my washer, prepared to install the new part, and then saw that my motor was leaking grease from the bearings onto the clutch housing. He told me that it was an expensive fix, and that if he installed the new part, it would only last a few months and then I would be back where I started. I had him put it back together without the new part, and while he was there, he also looked at my dishwasher, and told me how to fix it myself for cheap, and told me my under the counter wine cooler would be very expensive to fix, and that I would be better off buying a new wine cooler while I was buying the new washer. He was honest, could have installed the part and charged me $500, but instead he charged me the service call and a small fee for lubricating the clutch while he had it out. We were very impressed with Vladimir after some of the \""professionals\"" we have dealt with over the past several years. He's now on our speed-dial as our appliance repair guy."
3;Whenever I attend a convention at the World Trade Center (former convention center), I park at the Hilton and grab a cup of Joe at Fortuna.  Sometimes the lines are long, but it moves quickly so I'm not too worried about it.  Every once in a while I'll grab a Danish with my cup of Joe.\n\nYou can also buy glasses of Wine here and on certain days they have FREE Wine tastings.  Good stuff.\n\nWill I return?  There's no doubt about it.
3;Bellagio always has and probably always be my fav strip casino. \n\n The conservatory is a must see, which is to say if you havnt seen it, you must! Be ready though, cant take two steps in there in the evening on the weekends without ruining someone picture. So be creative (since youre going to be in them anyway) \n\nThe conservatory is changed for several seasons - chinese new year, spring summer/4th of July , autumn, Cmas.  \n\nThe water show is a great free attraction and is best seen from the dead center, in front of the hotel on the strip. (Although the bestest view is from any of the middle suites (the big round ones with the balconies on both sides of the living room).  Show is every 30 min (i think) at night. Go at night if you can - makes for better pics and its just not the same without the lighting.\n\nAlso, check out the lobby (front desk) and the upside down glass sculptures/umbrellas/chandelier thing by Dale Chihuly.\n\nIf youre down on the strip, walking , the last thing you want to do is go into a hotel and .... walk. But this hotel is worth checking out. Or grab a seat at the Petrossian Bar (right off the front desk/lobby area), order a drink and nurse it cuz its a great place to people watch.\n\nTo the left of the hotel, under the giant sign is the moving sidewalk. So you can take a break and ride in. Drops you off near the front entrance. Youll just be an escalator ride away from the front doors and the Petrossian Bar and that umbrella sculpture thing.\n\nThe pool area is very nice but its just a pool. That is to say its not a lazy river (MGM) or a giant wavepool (Mandalay Bay) just a pool. Kind of a disappointment  there.  \n\nThe typical rooms are.... typical. Not the greatest. Suites (even the small ones ) kick *ss. If youre going to get a small suite get one on the end and strip side so your view wraps around.
4;great food and the portions are large and in charge
1;"Overall, meh. Went out to grab what I was hoping would be an excellent burger to kick off a three-day convention slog in Vegas. The Paris burger with caramelized onion and Brie was well-prepared - but I can do better with ingredients from Safeway, and the raved-about waffle fries from other reviews were very obviously straight out of a frozen bag. Pickle was quite good, though. Living in San Francisco has spoiled me.\nBeers on tap were mostly your standard domestic fare; Bud, Miller Lite, etc. - at least they had Stella and Sam Adams... \nStaff was pretty on-the-ball and quite friendly, if I could give them four stars separately, I would. \nHowever, given the chance for a do-over - I'd go back to Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay. Much better beer selection, better ingredients."
2;I didn't find the staff over bearing, yes they obviously work on commission, but I didn't feel hounded. This store had really good selection.
1;Arrived and was seated swiftly. The wait person was quite nice and very attentive. The kitchen was very slow.\n\nNow, for the food. My medium hamburger was served raw in the centre and had to be sent back. After waiting an extremely long time to be served they obviously rushed the order and undercooked it. But that makes it all the more disappointing, because then I had to wait around again to get a properly cooked burger. (And let's be realistic, unless the meat is cut on the property, hamburger meat needs to be carefully cooked.) The fried pickles were excellent. The onion rings were obviously dropped into a fryer that was too cold since the batter was exceedingly oily and had little flavour and we only ordered them because so many people rave about them, only to find them almost a total disappointment that we didn't even want to eat.\n\nSo basically, good server, bad (slow) service caused by the kitchen. Disappointing onion rings and undercooked burger. What a disappointment... recommended by Thrillist, but maybe they haven't been here lately?
3;I'd only been there a couple of times before but they remembered my name and what I liked to drink. Pretty good in my book. I guess it's like a local bar, but downtown. I'll be back the next time I'm in Phoenix.
2;"I Yelped some Chinese food in Henderson near my job and Grand China popped up with some good reviews.  The lunch specials were mentioned a lot, so I ventured over to give it a whirl.  For a Monday at 11:30am, the place was empty except for myself and two gentlemen whom I recognized as employees of the city, too.  I quickly decided on the Cashew Shrimp lunch special for $6.95, which included a drink, soup, and the entree.  The egg drop soup that I chose was served quickly and piping hot.  Minutes later, my entree arrived and this is when the Yelper in me kicked in because I started counting how many shrimp I got: four.  They weren't tiny, but they weren't huge, either.  There were lots of vegetables to go with the shrimp and also a side of plain fried rice; I should have asked for white rice if I was thinking about it.  All in all, it was a decent meal for the price, plus the place is clean and service is fast."
3;The bar is close to everything.
4;Delicious kabobs and fresh bread...\n\nAnd Free Wifi...what else do i need:)?
3;Pink box is not for the faint of heart. Oh my goodness, they do not joke around with their donuts. Each donut was like a meal in itself. My brother and I went crazy and got one of each specialty (wouldn't recommend, way too much!), but my favorites were the apple fritter and the lemon meringue. It was ssssoo yummy, I died. I felt like crap after but had no regrets. They definitely know quality donuts here, but because the donuts are so rich and hearty I would only come here sparingly.
4;I just keep hearing all sorts of things about this great little place. \nNow that I have been here, I have to say it is all true.\nEverything here is wonderful!\nButtermilk Pie with Caramel poured on top......delish!\nWe also got some cookies. We took those home and some dog treats. Which of course she loved but, loved them last time someone gave them to her as well.\n\nGreat place, cool little place that used to be a house. Serch for parking on the street, not too hard to find. Or in the worst sit. there is a huge parking lot accross the street for free.
0;"Never coming back here again! We walked in and were told the wait was 10-15 minutes for a party of 5. 35 minutes later, we were still waiting. In that time, they seated 7 parties of 2 and 3 that came in after us. They kept assuring us that they simply needed a table large enough for us (and they couldn't possibly put two smaller tables together, for unknown reasons).\n\nAfter waiting for 45 minutes for a table, two tables opened up at the same time. One was a 6 top, one was a 4 top. They tried to seat the 5 of us at the 4 top. (Side note, their 4 tops are NOT large by any means). Now, at least 2 of the other parties that came in AFTER us and were seated BEFORE us were seated at other 4 tops. \n\nAt this point we politely said no, we wanted the 6 top so we could sit comfortably. They went the consult the owner (I'm assuming she was the owner, she was a female with short curly hair who wasn't wearing the standard black uniform). The owner then rolled her eyes and, said, \""Yeah, well I want a million dollars.\"" She didn't realize our party was standing directly behind her and to the left, so we were able to hear the conversation very clearly.\n\nIsn't that lovely? After making us wait 45 minutes, we are being unreasonable by asking for a table that will actually seat all of us, when there is one available right there. They did eventually, reluctantly, seat us at the 6 top.\n\nPity, several members of our party were actually big fans of this place, but you can't come back from such terrible customer service. The biggest problem, honestly, was the fact that they tried to seat us at the 4 top after a 45 minute wait with an open 6 top right next to us. Several of our party has worked in food service and we understand waits taking longer sometimes due to parties sitting around chatting. But treating us like we're being demanding for wanting space to sit AFTER such a wait is unacceptable. The owner's comment was the final nail in the coffin to assure we never return. Clearly this place has no appreciation for it's customers."
1;We decided to stop by this Yoforia after having dinner at Senor Tequila & doing a little shopping at Trader Joes. Our plan was to get some fro-yo to take home for later. \n\nCompared to the Yoforia at the Promenade on Providence, this one leaves a lot to be desired.  \n\nFor starters, they don't have the little tasting cups out in a convienant location... we had to wait in line to get a couple so that we could taste the new flavors before we made our decision. When we started looking at the flavors, we noticed that they were sold out of at least 3 of the selections. \n\nThey did had a couple of holiday yogurts - peppermint mocha & eggnog, but I didn't care for these flavors at all.  We decided we would just go with the pineapple because it is tasty. However, we were not able to even halfway fill up a small container, as they apparently ran out of the pineapple too.  :-(\n\nWe aren't big on toppings, especially when it is a self-serve scenario, so we skipped that. \n\nNext time we want to grab a bite of fro-yo, I'll hold out for Pinkberry or head to the other Yoforia location instead.
2;"Definitely not bad; not really good either. It's nice that the garlic knots are complementary and pretty good. Nice discounts offered. Will not be back."
4;About Me:\nA year-round flip flop aficiando whose nail painting skills are on par with a drunk pre-schooler's attempts at replicating a Van Gogh masterpiece.\n\nWhy I've been a Red Rock Nails customer for almost 3 years:\nI truly value the precision and expertise of the Red Rock Nails' staff's very steady hands and the public service they do by cleaning up the snaggle-toed masses of Summerlin.\n\nReasonable prices and impeccable cleanliness (no fear of funky foot fungi here) are just extra icing on my freshly frosted toes.
0;"Have you ever \""called\"" this location...??? I thought I had called an adult training school.... I really dont think they should let them answer the phone at all.... ugh....no good"
1;Lovely hotel, as you'd expect, but the service is shocking.\n\nWe were here initially, then in LA for a few days and back here again for two nights.  We had booked a room for four people but on the first check in they said the room wasn't suitable for four.  They didn't propose to do anything about it, even though they could see we had booked for four people.  In the end we managed to get them to put two foldaway beds in and we managed OK.\n\nWhen we came back just now for the second visit they tried to charge us extra for the two foldaway beds.  When we said 'No' they went away and then came back and said it would be OK - No apology for trying to charge us extra.\n\nAlso, trying to pull up to load/unload the car is a trauma.  Both times they waved me through to an area and then told me I couldn't park there.  After driving round the loop again they told me to pull up in the valet area where we then got abused by the valets.\n\nAs I said, very nice hotel, food is good and the baggage people were very friendly but I couldn't recommend staying here.
2;Best flavor chili chicken wings when not overcooked. Delicious with ranch. I keep going back just for these! Could do with providing finger tip bowls or wipes though, the sauce gets all over your face. Yummy!
4;"Just when I thought I had been to ALL the best \""Pho Joints\"" in Phoenix (I believe I have eaten in a total of 13!), up pops this one, which was listed (ranked) only as the #5 Best Vietnamese Restaurant by the Arizona Republic. The Arizona Republic got it wrong; the Pho was \""ambrosia.\"" Very aromatic, nice amount of meat and delicious! Not only am I ranking it #2 and only slightly behind Dragonfly, it is by far the best looking and best appointed Restaurant of any of the Pho Joints I have seen. Also, it is run by a gorgeous Vietnamese young lady who does ALL of the cooking and is usually there to greet you! GREAT, I mean GREAT Springrolls complete or start this trip to \""Pho Heaven!\"" - Best Springrolls in Phoenix! On my second trip I had the Chicken Wings, recommended in The Republic as \""delicious,\"" equally PHABULOUS and have had them often since!"
2;Long on my list of places to try, I finally got to this long time Pittsburgh breakfast spot. Friend of Joe's, Kevin was in town for some R&R and called me on a cold Thursday morning for breakfast, I offered Deluca's as a choice since I've never been there and neither has he. After he accepted, I got to thinking how bad parking was in the strip. Low and behold a spot opened about a half block away. We walked in and immediately were seated in the same booth Adam Richman sat in filming a spot for Man Vs Food some years back. Once seated, a waitress zoomed in with menus, coffee cups and a hot pot of coffee, almost reading my mind. The coffee was okay, nothing special, think the same coffee at Eat N Park or Kings, a little disappointing. Looking over the menu it was loaded with Pittsburgh favorites and gluttonous offerings. I choose the thin, crepe like pancakes served with loganberry preserves. Kevin on the other hand chose the Steel City breakfast, 2 hot cakes, sausage, bacon, eggs, and toast made from Macinie's bread. It was huge amount of food. My crepe like pancakes were lite, airy and delicious. The loganberry preserves with the perfect compliment for them, adding a touch of sweetness, a perfect foil for the savory crepes. The bill came to under 16 bucks which isn't too bad, about the same as Eat N Park or King's. the only trouble is parking, and would derail me from making this one of my go to places.
1;You can't go wrong with BWW food. The service in the bar area after 10pm is awful and slow. The bartenders pretend they don't see you and don't make eye contact. It took a solid five minutes before we were greeted and asked for our drink order. The bartender never checked on us after she have us our drinks. We had to get her attention to order food and get another round of drinks. Very disappointing since it's the BWW around, will definitely go to Millers Ale house across the street at night, because of the lack of service.
2;This is a good lunch spot in the Strip, Pittsburgh, PA.\n\nSmaller menu that includes some 4-5 Subs, 3-4 Salads, Pizza (Custom or by the slice) and 1-2 Pasta dishes.  Everything is easily under $10 per person.\n\nI've had the Italian Sausage sub, it was quite tasty and a lot of food on top of a serious Italian Roll.  Go for the wrap option if you are more interested in the meat.\n\nSalads are by far the highlight for me.  They really pile on the veggies for $5!  Add chicken or steak for another $3, (good, but pretty obvious they had been strips in the freezer earlier that day).\n\nDecor leaves something to be desired, service is friendly enough.  Overally, fairly solid but nothing that really gets me excited.
4;(4.5 stars, but that rates a full 5 for Pittsburgh - I'm still holding out for a mindblowingly incredible bakery here)\n\nCan't believe I hadn't reviewed them - used to live 3 blocks away.  I never picked up a bad loaf from them, and the selection was always good.  Their bread's the best in town.  (Sweets are good, too, but there's plenty of other places in town to get those.) \n\n...Now if I could only get them to open a location Lawrenceville so I could have good bread in walking distance.
1;Another groupon purchase. A few months back I saw this groupon and purchased it, and it wasn't until a few weeks ago that I had the chance to go. I have been really into vegetarian sushi lately so I was excited to try this place. And Meh... is appropriate for this place. \n\nI came with my mom and husband on a Thursday night. The place wasn't busy at all and it was around 7pm. I think there were two other parties. When we walked in, the servers all looked at us. It took a few seconds of them staring at us for one to tell us to sit where we want, and then another few moments before anyone brought us menus. I had looked over the menu online before hand so I knew there were a few choices for me. I decided on the avocado rolls, vegan roll, and the tofu tofu roll. As far as the taste of them goes, they were all kind of bland. Even after dipping them in soy and wasabi. There were no sesame seeds on them which helps give them extra flavor. And the wasabi was unusually bland as well. I hardly got any spice from it at all. The most disappointing roll was the tofu tofu roll. It was different, deep fried tofu with green beans rolled inside of the tofu. So there was no rice in this roll. It was just ok. Again, really bland. They could have jazzed up the tofu or something. Everyone knows tofu needs love to taste good. Just tofu cut into blocks and deep fried isn't going to be very tasty.\n\nMy mom and husband got the Atkins roll and another one with yellow fin. They were also less than impressed with their selections.  One thing I noticed about this sushi place versus others I have been to, is the portion sizes are way smaller here. I ordered three rolls for me, which at any other sushi places stuffs me to the point where I feel like I am going to explode. Three rolls here, and I was still hungry. It made me sad. The only good thing this place has got going for it is the vegetarian rolls are all really cheap. Which is nice. The price of the fish rolls are all really expensive though. We had a $30 groupon and we still ended up paying an extra $15 on top of that because of how expensive the rolls were. Service here left a lot to be desired as well. The servers all stood around and talked with each other the whole time we were here. And we had to call to them for them to come over to the table. We probably wont be coming back here just because there are so many other sushi places in town better than this one.
0;HORRIBLE!!!! HORRIBLE!!!! NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALL! \nI have had a business account with bank of nevada for over 11 years and they have no customer service at all atleast at the henderson branch. Cheryl is the worse!!! TONS AND TONS OF FEES\nMy advice don' t invest your time or money into this bank!!
1;Let me start by saying two things - I agree with the previous post about the rates and caring nature of the staff.  However, we had a less than ideal experience when using Commonwealth Animal Hospital near the end of the life of one of our kitties.\n\nAt the advice of our regular vet (a traveling vet), we took our limping kitty to get an xray done.  The xray showed an old and healed hip fracture that probably occurred when she was a feral cat (before we adopted her).  However, they didn't note the mass in her pelvis.  She did not get better...and we made a new appointment, called for results, had to call back again because the doctor did not call back.  After several rounds of phone tag and visits, we ended up at a specialist.  When it was apparent that she had cancer and was near the end of her life, CAH was very compassionate in helping us make the decision to put her to sleep.    We decided to get her cremated, and they said they would handle it and let us know when her ashes were ready to be picked up.  About 2 weeks later, we got a bill from the crematorium.  When we called them, they said the ashes had been delivered to CAH well before the bill was mailed...and they never called us.  \n\nIn sum, they were very kind and sympathetic, but disorganized.  We could have known what was going on with our kitty much sooner and settled into the notion that she was dying.  And getting the bill before the ashes was really poor form.  I doubt if we will go back.
4;After trying most of the bbq restaurants around town, including the chain bbq places, Rollin Smoke BBQ is the real deal! SIMPLY THE BEST BBQ IN TOWN, the sides and the seafood are great too!!! Do yourself a favor, and treat yourself!!! Bring your family, bring your friends, hell, bring everyone!!! I guarantee you will love it!!! (I posted some of my food pictures here, so check it out!)
4;"I absolutely love this place. I've been here cocktails, lunch, crawfish boils, dinner, special events... every experience has been just top notch.\n\nDon't believe me? Well, two days after Yelp's Summertime Soiree, a few of my friends wanted to go somewhere nice for dinner before a birthday party that night. One friend said, \""let's go to the place that had the bread pudding at your Yelper party.\"" So, we did. And they were completely blown away.\n\nIt's not just the food that is amazing here, but also the staff. Miki (the general manager) is one of the most charming and captivating people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. He loves what he does. He's damn good at what he does.\n\nThe only go-to item that I must order every time I come here is a cocktail: the grasshopper. Hendrick's gin, cucumber water , wheatgrass, lime juice, jalapeno simple syrup... it should just be called perfection. The entire cocktail menu is impressive.\n\nI've enjoyed everything I've gotten here. We usually order all the specials and share them. For my latest meal, I went with the lamb. I have never ordered lamb at a restaurant. I wanted to get something different than everyone else at my table, so Miki suggested it. He, of course, did not steer me wrong. It was delicious. My friend Paul got the shrimp and grits. He completely cleaned his plate. Seriously, it looked like he licked it clean.\n\nIf you can manage to save room for dessert, get it. Hell, even if you are completely full... you should probably still get something sweet. \n\nParking: they do have complimentary valet during dinner. e2 also validates for the Levine Center for the Arts Parking Garage. \n\nGPS can sometimes be tricky for this location because of the new-ish road name. If you are having problems, use 135 1st Street or 550 South Tryon instead."
4;We traveled to Phoenix from Albuquerque looking for something different than your ordinary Japanese restaurant. This little gem exceeded our expectations! The low key, casual post-donut shop vibe was just what we wanted for our Monday lunch. Yes, a Japanese restaurant open on a Monday at lunch!! The owners were really cute and nice and the chef (wife) peeked her head out of the kitchen and asked how our meal was. \n\nMy mom and I had the minced tuna with green onion donburis which came with soup, salad, a skewer of chicken, and gyoza. This was a BIG meal and very authentic all for about $12. My sister had the salmon and ikura donburi which was also excellent as well and ikura donburis are hard to find nowadays...My dad had their special ramen bowl, whose name escapes me and was very tasty.\n\nOverall, I am a huge fan of this place and was surprised at the authenticity and home style cooking. Don't expect anything fancy, just good honest home style Japanese food with no frills. This is definitely a local's joint and a great value.
2;10-15min wait, friendly, great nail service though. Yes I will be back when I return. Thanks for the foot spa referral Jimmy!
3;I really like the wings, specifically because of the sauce choice. My favorites are Mango Habenero (spicy), Wild (spicy) , Caribbean Jerk (medium) and Teriyaki (mild)\nSpicy Garlic (medium) is also pretty good. \nThe chips with cheese and cajun seasoning is delicious. \nI almost always sit at the bar and the bartenders are great. Dani and Michelle are my favorites, but the guys on weekend swing and grave are always great too.
4;Pizza is my favorite food and I could eat it everyday. That being said, naked city is the best pizza I have found in Vegas. I have lived here almost a year, tried 15 different places and naked city it the best. The Guinea pie is perfection and I have had the stinger and the naked city as well. All of them were delicious but the Guinea pie was the best.\n\nFor appetizers, the suicide fries are only for the brave of heart. I love them but my boyfriend would not even try them. They are hot! The garlic buns are like cinnamon rolls but with no cinnamon and add garlic and cheese...aka awesome.\n\nFinally the location, I personally love that this place in in a dive bar! It a not that scary like other reviews have said. I thought it was awesome. The service is ok. I have had great service and ok service but the food is worth any experience. \n\nSo if you have kids, don't come to this location but if you do not have children naked city pizza is the best pizza vegas has to offer.
3;I really enjoy this place for a Sunday breakfast. We usually go for the omelettes, but enjoy the pancakes and the banana bread is to die for. We started splitting an omelette lately, because they are huge.
1;In search of the perfect, cheap pizza we recently picked up a $6 large pepperoni from PM. Our expectations were low, so we were pleasantly surprised to find the pizza was a nice size and the ingredients appeared to be good quality. Although I thought the crust was a bit thin, overall the taste was pretty good.\n\nThis is not pizza to get excited about at all. Oh, and did I mention you have to cook it yourself? But it you were having a ton of people over and wanted to save some money, this would be a great cost saver and most people would think it was delivery. And it is way better than frozen pizza any day.
3;I love the simplicity of this small sandwich shop.  Expect to pay around $7.50 per meal, which isn't bad, but maybe a little too much for the simple sandwiches.  The sandwiches are great, don't get me wrong, but it's nothing I can't whip up on my own at home with some better-than-Walmart groceries.\n\nGood, fun, clean place in a nice location.  It's worth stopping by if you're in downtown Mesa.
0;Cockroaches in the salsa and serving the food. Every time I've been here I wish I had gone else where.
3;"We recently took our American Bulldog in to be spayed, and overall were pleased with the results.\n\nPro: Very Low Prices, Several Services Offered, One Day Service: For only $180, we were able to get our 68 pound dog spayed, all of her vaccinations up to date, her nails cut, and plenty of pain medication to last for several days. I simply dropped her off in the morning, and picked up early evening (5 pm). It's been a week and so far, so good! \n\nCon: Poor Customer Service, Up-Selling, Crowded: Because of the low prices, this place is packed! You can drop off your pet anytime between 6:30 (6?) and 8:00 am.  Make sure you get there as soon as they open!! It truly is \""first come, first serve\"", and you'll wait with your pet until they call you to the back room.  The guy working the desk was short, unsmiling and brisk.  However, there were animals everywhere, it was 6 am, constant barking, and he was the only person there to handle it all - no easy task! When you do meet with the Vet and the assistants, they will try to sell you other services.  Personally, I didn't mind because the prices were so much cheaper than at our vet (vaccinations, nail trimming, etc.)  If you don't need/want anything other than what you made the appointment for, simply decline.\n\nIt has since been a week, and our little girl is doing great! Her stitches are healing nicely (get your own \""cone\""/no lick collar - they don't provide one), and she is back to her normal self.  There is nowhere else, for the price, that we could have had all that work done.  They are certainly not warm and friendly, but in the end, they do their job, which is really all I wanted.  Chloe (our dog) gets plenty of loving at home, so it's all good!"
4;I came here last year and that's all it took to get 5 stars! \n\nThe best steak I have ever had in my lifetime and I've had eaten many all over the place, also was the cheapest in price! I don't know how this was only a 4/5? This place not only had the best steak but the best price for it plus 2 large sides that I couldnt even finish due to the LARGE STEAK for $10. Also had the best ROOT BEER in the world! It tasted like Dr. Pepper to me, but damn the best Root Beer/Dr Pepper ever. Made fresh as well. \n\nIf you want to come and save some $$$ with GREAT FOOD come to Ellis Island everyday on your visit and you wont be disappointed one bit and your poop will be larger than life! lol! I know when I turn 21 the first place Im going to is ELLIS ISLAND..with that being the last place as well!
0;This place is horrible!!! My daughter and I both went in to have a full set of acrylics put on and it was a nightmare!!! My nails have bubbles all over them, not the length I asked for, super glue all over my fingers and inconsistent white on all of the nails.\n\nHer technician was incredibly rude, didn't cut to the length she asked for, left polish (black) all over her fingers, and didn't polish the entire nail.\n\nI requested our money back so we could have them fixed elsewhere but of course he thought they looked fine.  I even asked the person who's nails he was doing at the time if she thought my nails looked bubbly and awful and she agreed as well.\n\nPlease don't waste your hard earned money!!! These people are the worst!!!
4;"I have to give HUMAN NATURE and their show five stars even though the show venue is one star.  Since that's not HN's fault, that's why I'll give them five stars.\n\nWhat needs to go is the Imperial Palace.  What a ducking fump this place is.   Yeah, I know, there's a wall along one side they're remodeling because of the looming Linq project.  Still, that's NO EXCUSE for the condition of the remainder of the casino.  Dumpy casinos on Freemont are better looking than this abandoned Home Depot warehouse with delusions of grandeur.\n\nAnd you'd think that if a show as solid as HUMAN NATURE was on a second story of this toilet there'd be a GIANT VEGAS SIZED SIGN by the CRITICAL escalator.  Nope.  Like everything at the IP they apparently don't give a damn.   This place is one of the few hotels on the strip that not only should be imploded... but I'd gladly contribute my resort fee to make it happen.\n\nSo, once you find the mysterious escalator path to the showroom, it's as pathetic as showroom spaces go.  The tables and chairs mostly look worn and rented.  You fear you've been screwed.  The lights finally dim (allowing you to imagine you're in a nice theater) and MOTOWN MUSIC starts.  \n\nNot live music, mind you.  A recording.  Hello.... that's STUPID.  Just start the show.  Nope.  Two entire songs this way.  Then a screen drops and Smokey Robinson starts talking to you.  About how amazing his Aussie boys HUMAN NATURE are.  Again, I'm like, look, just open with these 'amazing' men and I'm sure if they're at all impressive we'll be impressed as well and the freakin' show can begin before the Imperial Palace collapses under it's junk food weight.\n\nFinally the 'boys' hit the stage and WHAMMO you know in under one minute the ticket prices were a steal.  Even if you payed full price.  It doesn't matter.  They're AMAZING.  And you wonder what purpose the long intro served.  If HUMAN NATURE wants to pad the show to make it feel longer, replace this strange intro with the band warming us up with two Motown songs.  \n\nUnderstand:  I'm not the biggest Motown fan.  Seriously.  I was a baby during the critical years.  But that really doesn't matter once you hear these guys sing and watch them dance.  I'll be frank and admit that sometimes I wanted them to be four black dudes who could PERFECTLY mimic Motown.  That said, if you had to hire four white dudes to do Motown, this was the best 'Jersey Boys' group you'd find.\n\nAs much fun as this was for me and my parents, a few picky notes.  One, this group wants you to understand that they're as big as ABBA down under.  Since none of us in the US have ever heard of them -- we don't really care.  But all night long they keep trying to make you 'get' that these guys are really big somewhere else.  I'm not even sure if it's true but -- again -- WE DON'T CARE.    (If you're so frickin' big over there, how it is that they can spare you for years over here singing MOTOWN?  Doesn't add up, does it?)  So please shut up about this and just nail MOTOWN the powerful way you do the things you do.\n\nSecondly, the band name HUMAN NATURE might as well be DAISY PAPAYA.  It doesn't work.  It makes the show impossible to recommend to others.  I tried.  Y'all need some name like MOTOWN UNDER.  It explains what and where from in two words.  Or in Vegas you might take the band's weakest aspect and make it your strength;  FOUR WHITE GUYS SINGING MOTOWN.  Whatever.  Anything but HUMAN NATURE.\n\nThese three things (location, band name, prior band history) obscure an otherwise phenomenal group.  Their band is hot, their moves are perfect, their song choice and sequence solid, their energy limitless, their repartee kinda corny but kinda charming too.  This is the only band in a long time I've seen successfully manage to get the audience up and dancing.  We shaked the cardboard underpinnings of the Imperial Palace.  I was literally bouncing up and down on this second story showroom like a kid in an air castle.\n\nAt the end of the show there was a line to meet the boys.  I had to run so I snuck up to one and said, \""What the hell are you guys doing here?  You belong across the street in the Terry Fator theater at the Mirage.\""  He was so humble he appeared flattered.  Class act.\n\nSo as long as you're willing to see a reasonably priced show inside a NYC subway station restroom, you're going to have a really great time."
3;Been back a couple times since last review.  Margaritas were perfect both times.  Watermelon margaritas are unstoppable!  Chile relleno was a little bland and soupy, but the rest of the menu was terrific as usual.
0;My wife and I stayed here last year around July. We searched around to find a nice hotel for a few nights that would fit our budget. When we got to the hotel, we notice a lot of police in the area and it looked to be in a bad neighborhood. The room and bed was fine and the hotel did not look run down. We only stayed one night and went back home. Next we will find something better and in a better location.
4;Wife and I were glad they opened up here on this side of town. We immediately became members. \nThe facility is impeccable! The staff is extremely courteous and helpful!! We had a excellent time on the range and a great experience here! \nKeep up the good work!!!!
0;"WOW I am definitely surprised by the number of stars this place has been rated by people. This was probably THE MOST disappointing meal of my life. I ordered a pasta, described as with pecorino and pepper , and this was exactly what I got.  It was disgustingly plain looking,  as it was just narrow, long pasta noodles with pepper, cream,  EXTREME amounts of salt, and the cheese (pecorino) was melted and mixed in.  It was NOT even garnished with any parsley or any greens, it was just plain pasta--no veggies at all.  Presentation was horrible. It was just piled on a very plain plate, not even on an attractive plate.  It tasted like I just threw a box of spaghetti noodles in, mixed some cheese in and threw some pepper on. This place is in a PRIME location at Venetian, so I was definitely surprised at the quality of the food. Mario Batali, your name has forever been tarnished in my mind because your name is on this restaurant. My meal was the most dissatisfying meal I have ever had, and to top it off, I PAID someone to make me this horrible dish, I didn't even make myself the worst meal of my life!!!  It was $17, which I thought to myself (based on the location/looks/chef Mario Batali's name on the restaurant) seemed like a bargain, but I was let down almost instantaneously with one bite. The best part of this visit was probably the packaged breadsticks they give you in the beginning of the meal-- yes, individually packaged breadsticks, which were not even good. \n\nI went in a group of about 7 people, and I tried everyone's dish-- it all tasted the same--but theirs just looked better. I thought maybe I had just picked the bad menu item, but they were all bad!! I think though the worst dish was the \""salad\""--and we were all confused because the \""salad\"" included radicchio + mozzarella. It sounded good on the menu--although I am not a fan of radicchio because of the strong bitter taste, I decided to try it. To my surprise there existed a dish even WORSE than my own! It was not a bed of fresh, raw veggies + fresh mozzarella-- it was in fact cooked radicchio mixed with melted mozzarella. It was an epic mess. \n\nSo disappointed by Mario Batali's cuisine. I will NEVER be returning here NOR will I be going to any of his restaurants because clearly this restaurant is ruining his image, and nothing is being done about it. \n\nI will NEVER be returning to this restaurant,"
3;Good atmosphere and friendly service. I like the gluten free menu.
2;Not the best froyo I've had and too expensive. I like that they have chocolate sorbet but their original tastes weird.
4;Long wait YES, but worth it. Your gonna wait for quality. Price was great. Customer service was awesome. Even though I wasn't a regular and visiting from out of state was treated just like the next customer... EXCELLENT!\n\nI suggest this place for those living and visiting :)
0;Ordered the salmon it was extremely dry my fiance did not like his dish either. I will not return to this place ever again!
2;I love this place, but every time I go the service seems to get worse. I know the Chuckbox isn't known for its friendliness but  lately their servers seem to just be annoyed at their jobs. Twice I have clearly ordered BBQ chicken and I was given a buffalo sauce. It's fun to go once or twice but it's pretty expensive. Sometimes the condiments look ok, sometimes they look pretty gross.
4;"This is absolutely my favorite restaurant in Montreal. I have been twice now and both times were exceptional. For a fixed price, you get an appetizer, soup, unlimited bread, entree, dessert, and coffee. The prices are beyond reasonable for the amount of (amazing) food that you you get. Food is as good as or better than anything I've had in Boston/NYC without the rip-off factor.\n\nBoth times I had the flank steak, which comes with sauteed green beans and these hashbrown-like crispy potatoes that are to die for. I've also had their mushroom soup and regular dinner salad (which is loaded with figs and some fun cheeses) and both were awesome. The one thing not to miss, however, is the Raclette. Ask for extra peppercorns, you will not be disappointed. I know few things better than a slab of baked, melted cheese on a plate. It's served with a side of gherkin pickles, which sounds strange but the combination is really incredible. I have also had tried their creme brulee and chocolate torte, both fantastic. It's BYOB, which of course always helps keep our wallets happy! And they never judge for bringing a bottle per person :)  \n\nThe services is always over the top as well. Their menu is in French only, however, staff are always helpful with the translation. The ambiance is beautiful too; it's a small neighborhood joint that is near downtown but not in the middle of the hustle and bustle of everything. It's quiet and outdoor seating is available in summer (and its really cute!) Definitely check this place out; I will definitely be back next time I am in Montreal!"
2;Was in the area, so I decided to stop by and try this new place.  It was pretty busy at around 1:30PM.  \nThe red velvet pancake is good but the other local hawaiian food isn't that great.\nWorth a try if you're into fancy pancakes.\nOverall experience was ok.  Kind of a little pricey I think.
1;Latte wasn't very good. The milk was well made, not over heated, but the coffee it was made from was not robust or fresh tasting.
0;"I am rating the Service Center, and in general the process and quality of repairs done by this location over 5 years under the \""MaxCare\"" extended warranty. \n\nThe 1 star is for Kim at  the Sahara CarMax who was kind enough to refer me to Goodfellas Auto Repair (highly recommend!) just north on Rainbow from this CarMax when they were 2 weeks out on repairs and my alternator had gone out. I wish I could do it all over again I would only have EVER taken my car to the authorized repair shops, paid the $25 more deductible and had all repairs done quickly and easily for the actual deductible amount. Every repair done at CarMax was terrible and slow. I tried going to my preferred mechanic but he didn't understand or complete the authorization process and I would get charged more than my deductible. And I think Goodfellas Auto Repair only opened in 2012, I've had the car since 2008, but man - I would warn everyone to just avoid the Vegas repair centers CarMax provides all together and pay a little more to get the repairs done right by literally anyone else.\n\nEven the simplest of repairs done here (and the other Vegas/Henderson location) take 2-3 times as long as they should and are often not actually repairs at all (utilizing electrical tape instead of replacing broken cables) (oil leak was 'repaired' with a gasket and yet still leaked for a year until the next repairs attempt (at an outside shop) showed it required more parts than just the gasket). \n\nFrom diagnosis of the repair to carrying out the actual fix, it's all shoddily done and takes FOREVER. You think you'll save money even if you don't save time by leaving your car with CarMax (deductible is usually $50 at CarMax or $75 at a CarMax authorized repair center,  or $100 for your own non-authorized mechanic) but this was NEVER the case, not once in the 4-5 repairs they sort of or didn't actually do that the car needed over the 5 years. And more than once I came to pick up the car and the charge was more than the $50 deductible, from adding on diagnostics and labor fees on repairs covered under warranty (not maintenance)"
2;Although this airport is old, dated and lacking any nice amenities the airport is small and easy to navigate.  The taxi line can get super long but it moves fast so don't be discouraged. \n\nStay away from the slots. Some of the worst odds in the whole city.
1;I know Sonic isn't a typical fast food place - you never go inside - but still, the employees need to be a little more cognizant of the fact that we can still see what you are doing.\n\nStopped there for lunch today and was parked in a stall right outside the door. I watched (after I had received and eaten my food) one of the guys that works there bring a bag of trash outside and set it down by the door. Then I watched as he went and got another bag and did the same thing. Not a minute later, he came out the door with a tray of food in his hands to deliver to a car. Hmmmm... enough time to wash your hands or no?\n\nAlso, why put the trash right by the door instead of taking it to the dumpster? Which was a few feet away, and he's on roller skates! It's not like he even had to walk there.\n\nRight before I left, I watched a girl come out and walk right by the two bags of trash to go have a cigarette. Where she proceeded to stand right next to the dumpster. Hello? Take the trash with you maybe? \n\nThe food was good - no complaints there. But still - do something about the health and safety aspect of this place.
4;My favorite vet is no longer here, but I still connected with Dr. McDermitt.  He and his staff provide excellent care of my cats.  \n\nThey seem very busy however, and it pays to be patient, they have a huge amount of employees, but the number of pets coming in the door, it's overwhelming. \n\nThe appointment was on time, the care performed was excellent, and they called to update and arrange for pick up time.  Services are excellent, staff excellent, good place for veterinary care.
4;I've gone to manisha for about a year now and can trust she will always make me look great. I've gone to her before photoshoots, runways, and other modeling gigs. She is phenomenal and never makes my eyebrows too thin. She is a true artist and will not only thread your eyebrows but shape them in a perfect way that matches your face. Besides that the facility is always clean and staff is always friendly! Love this place.
4;Was in town for a recent sporting event and read good things about Ds. A bit off the beaten path, but an easy bus ride from my Oakland hotel (and bus originates from Downtown, so should be easy ride from there, too).\n\nDs did not disappoint: creative craft beer list of 25+ taps, plus hundreds of bottles in the Beer Cave that you can have onsite or take to-go, and some of the best dogs I've ever had. Was there on a Friday, so got the Scorpion (cheddar jalapeno kielbasi) & fries deal for $5.50--excellent. Also tried the very good Ds Brat (cheesy bratwurst) & fries (same price), and they do a terrific version of the Chicago Dog. There are also 20+ toppings options if you want to DIY. Nice, friendly service from the guys behind the bar/in the kitchen made this a fine time.\n\nNext time I'm in PGH, Ds will be at the top of my list to visit. Can't wait to try their other dogs and whatever they have on tap (or in the Cave).\n\nP.S. There is also sit-down service in a room between the bar and Cave that seemed more family-friendly. I noticed several tables had pizzas and burgers, so I assume those are decent, too.
0;One of the worst experience I have ever had with my nails. I walked in for a mani/pedi and they took me in immediately. They were so impatient and wanted me to hurry up picking up the nail paint. \nThe lady attending to me did an OK job on my feet, but she ruined my finger nails. I kept telling her that the tips are rough and not neat at all, but  she didn't listen to me nor did she reply back. She just kept uttering something in a language unknown to me.\nPlus in order to get that right she just kept adding more coats on my finger nails. The nail paint started coming off within an hour. I was so disappointed with the service, I usually go back to the salons if something goes wrong but I knew there was no fun here.
1;I would give them a 4 but this is why I can't , the food is very good, service very bad, food is inconsistent, and meals that have basil come without, u ask why, they say cuz we ran out.   I got a rubber band in my soup and they didn't apologize,  I ordered smoothie with boba, but didnt get boba, the waiter said I am such a dope its my fault over and over. i was like Im reading my book  it is fine, I thought that was cool of me LOL   the food can be a 5 but mostly it is  a 3,  the owner is weird and mean, Once she left and my daughter and I had to wait for over 1/2 an hou to pay cuz I didn't have cash to just leave it, nobody would have known, but I would have. I asked if hey had desert cuz my 7 year old was getting restless they said no,, then came back said coconut ice cream I said sure.  they charged 4.50 for it, so I didn't tip when I finally could pay the check she told me  you never tip! ha ha ha. I tip when there is a reason , this is the first time I  didn't tip, because they got there tip from  the ice cream I didn't want.  I will go back cuz the food is good. its close to home, but I don't let them deliever anymore, I don't want psycho owner showing up at my home again.  I got 2 groupons, now that will be fun to use.  12 for 24 . no worries. eat here if u don't mind  maybe getting the dish u order to come out the same as the last time.  I am glad I am light hearted about it. I do order from better places mostly due to different reciepes.
2;I have always just passed by this place but I decided to give it a try. I've had preconceived notions about this place. I pictured it dark with teak wood on the inside. The decor  was a pleasant surprise! They have these lovely Moroccan lanterns hanging from the ceiling. It has a light modern feel to it. \n\nI ordered the Seafood Medley (39.95) tiger shrimp,  scallops, and lobster. It comes with vegetables., salad and white rice. I upgraded to the fried rice. I was disappointed to find out fried rice wasn't automatic like most places. It was good but they would come in third with Geisha Steak house and Ohjah in the lead. The scallops were better at Ohjah.  They lacked in taste here. The guy putting on the show was cool though! \n\nThis would be a nice place to hang out during happy hour if you like a stylish atmosphere.
3;When I was about to leave Champaign for Chicago, my boss and I went on a culinary tour around Chambana and Silvercreek was on the top of our list. She was raving about the Sunday brunch and they were right, it was so so good. \n\nThere's an egg station if you want your eggs custom made. Then there's other fancy meats, fish like whole smoked salmon, pastries, and of course, desserts.  The price tag is expensive for the Chambana area but the food selection will all be worth it. This is a must do for anyone in town.
2;Not a bad club, but not on par with others in town.  It is dark and loud and crowded.  The walkways around the dance floor are narrow and tough to navigate.  The crowd was decent and music was as well.  Don't go out of your way for Moon, but pay a visit if you go to Playboy below it.
3;This pool is one of the largest ones in Vegas. Two different pool areas and then bungalows with private spa areas. The venue is huge and there is plenty room along the pools. Of course, getting a daybed with a large group is the best way to go. The staff will really take care of you and the chicken tenders on the menu are to die for! Or maybe I was just starving after 4 non-stop hours of frozen drinks... \n\nRegardless, the only downfall will be if you get stuck in line. It will take forever and they will go through everything you own and throw away your medicine, gum, tic tacs, etc. Just bring your ID, credit card, and phone!
4;Fantastic food. After reading the reviews I thought I would give this restaurant a try. What a gem! This has to be one of the best Indian food dining experiences I've  had.  All dishes ordered were delicious. \nWe missed the lunch buffe where we could have tasted more dishes but we did experience 5 different entrees.\n\nService was attentive and friendly.  \n\nMelque, the owner and entertainer (She has a lovely voice) made our dinner quite memorable.  We will go back.
3;A hidden gem just outside of Las Vegas - on the floor level of all things - a motel!  A little seedy from the outside, but that all dissipated when you walk through the door into a modern, chic diner.   They don't take reservations, but come early to avoid the wait.  We got there just before eleven on a Saturday and were able to be seated right away.  There was a bit of a wait (in 100+ heat!) by the time we left.\n\nOn to the food - in order of yumminess, BOLDs are HIGHLY recommended:\n\nGRILLED CHICKEN SANDWICH on ciabatta - This was the highlight of the meal.  Stuffed with tomato and arugula, - warm, tasty, and fresh.  I would definitely recommend this.\n\nBIEGNETS - SO yummy!!!  Probably best to share, since they really are just donuts, but so soft and warm, and perfect with the jam and cream.\n\nSHRIMP AND GRITS - This was really good.  I can't even explain it - it really just looks like a bowl of runny grits with shrimp, but the flavor was superb. \n\nHuevos montunlenos - I know these are a big hit on Yelp, but maybe I'm just not a Mexican breakfast type of person.  I recognize that these had a good, spicy flavor with the salsa and tortillas cooked in, but just not my cup of tea.  Now, if you LOVE your Mexican breakfast, go for it!\n\nTomato soup - I agree with the other reviews - really salty.  We initially had wanted the tomato salad, but were told they were out and only had the soup, which we settled for.  Oh well.\n\nAll in all, a great meal.  My dad still talks about it weeks later.  Street parking was not too difficult.  And it's just down the street from where they shoot Pawn Stars, so you can spend a little time walking off your food perusing there!  :)   (did I just embarrass myself by admitting we watch that show so much that we recognized the shop driving by?)
4;"I want to be crystal clear here - this review is for my meal under Taisho (chef) Hisa-san...the rest of the attitude, service, vibe and general faux-Japanese uselessness of this place would earn it an easy 1 star. In fact, I have eaten here accidentally in the past - invited by someone, and it was terrible.\n\nBut complete kudos to the owner who is sharp enough to have hired Hisa-san, the amazing chef from Toranoko, and before that Tamon and I believe Nobu in NYC? If I'm not mistaken. The sad part is that this man's ability is wasted on the mind numbing rolls upon rolls that are ordered every two seconds here. \n\nThis is of course a fake Japanese restaurant. And by \""fake\"", I mean run with a mish-mash, miss-match of Japanese style, and American expectations (which usually translates to what you're used to eating in Korean run Japanese places - which is sauce drenched 3rd grade fish). \n\nIn any event, someone here is at least trying to do things right by bringing in one of the most talented sushi chefs in North America. And no - he aint my cousin, or my roomate. I only know him from Toranoko in LA where he served me many a wonderful lunch and dinner. \n\nIn any event, I ordered a special Chirashizushi, which I have uploaded a pic of. It was mind blowingly good.\n\nThe hot sake was 22 bucks for a large, and was pretty nasty. Ozeki? lol Green tea martini was 14 bucks and not enough alcohol for a minor buzz. Younger asian waitress was very good. No oshibori unless requested. \n\nThis place is geared for pretentious social climbers and you'll see and hear them all around you if you sit at a table but the bar clientele was a bit better. \n\nStill, while I was eating - this complete douche walked over to me - on behalf of what looked like his Beverly Hills \""entourage\"", spending daddy's money on frivolity and had the bloody nerve to tell me to move the end of the bar because he and his friends needed my seats. Oh my. I wish I could have taken a snapshot of his face when I gave him that look that Tsuruta Koji usually wears right before someone's head (spicy hand) rolls off his shoulders. I mean - who are these fools? \n\nWhat's worse is that the host staff looked on as this happened and did nothing. I mean - there was food in my mouth, and this gangbanger-wanabee momo that probably has a VIP pass to Attari sandwich shop in Westwood, is bugging me - they acted like, \""hey cool, maybe they can get him to move\"". 1 star! \n\nIn any event, it was one of the best meals of my life...which is kind of evident when you look at the pics.\n\nI suggest that Ribbon does the following:\n\n1. Allow for a proper experience at the Sushi bar by having Hisa san, and anyone of his calibur in an area AWAY from the rolls and crap orders. Have them focused on Omakase sushi in a quieter, less intense environment where Japanese customers who drop big coin, will feel comfortable. As it was I didn't see one Japanese person eating here.\n\n2. Bring your prices to a normal level on nigiri and your sushi bar business will pick up. It was half empty or empty when I walked by a few times over the past couple of days. \n\n3. Get a print out of what Omotenashi is and teach a little bit to your hosts, waiters and waitresses. In fact - read it yourself! There is no excuse for a 3.5 star restaurant in this hotel - none. \n\nOsu!"
4;When we heard that Mundo had another more causal restaurant we were immediately interested. Great place to hangout before first Friday or before a night out in the town. \nThere's really nothing we haven't liked. Everything is delicious. Drinks are delicious as well.
4;I have driven past this past this place 100's of times. I never thought to stop in here until I read about it on yelp. I ordered the combo (beef and chix) although I'm usually not a fan of beef at these places cause its usually chewy. Well, the chix was delicious. For me, just below the too salty threshold, which is perfect. The same can be said for the beef. And I was impressed with the chew on the beef, it had a nice give too it and was delicious. And the grizzle, yum. Getting back to the salt factor, it winds up being perfectly balanced when you put it into the taco with the onions and salsa. Very impressed!
2;"I loved the atmosphere, the back patio was very nice.  Our waitress was very attentive, we ordered the warm brie and hummus... along with a bottle of Malbec, then we decided to order an entr\u00e9e to share...  We ordered the salmon and they brought it out on 2 plates, the presentation was nice, the salmon was encircled with grits and a green sauce and there were some julienned grilled veggies on top of the salmon but for $22, we basically got a \""taste\"" , the entire 2 pieces of salmon couldn't have weighed more than 3 oz and the little bit of grits and veggies could not be considered \""sides\"".  The salmon was tasty, I just wish there had been more of it.  I guess we paid for the nice atmosphere.  I would go back but probably just for wine and apps."
2;I used to say this was my favorite rest in Vegas. Now it is just ok.  The Spicy Chicken plate is great, but it seems like the portions have been cut in half. I used to be able to make 2 meals off one plate...Not any more.  They also nickel and dime you for extra sauce, rice or noodle substitutions. I would have given this rest a 5 back in 2008. Now only a 3...AVERAGE
0;Rude receptionist ..does not know about  co-pay..spent 10 mins double checking with Blue Cross ..as many others ..could not help me..wasted 50 bucks...And whats up with the Doctors dog in the lobby..Could not hear Doc explaining results with dog barking!!!
2;My opinion of the food and service has not changed. But they have gotten a bad habit of not opening on time. Sometimes up to 2 hours late!
0;"Probably the worst shop I have seen. Ever. Super unprofessional, I got a tattoo from Ed and my sister from Jason , both of them looked terrible and mine was so swolen from day one! The ink was oozing out immediately and I have had many tattoos from many ships, never like this. They were also very rude and smelled so strongly like smoke it was  just a terrible experience. I am having mine covered by a different shop next week. The guy at the other shop showed me a bunch of before and after photos of Jason's work he has fixed, how is there not some type of regulation in this industry! One of the photos had \""this too shall pass\"" on a girl,  with the p missing ... This too shall ass! Indeed it shall"
2;"This is one of the few times when I don't want to rate a place by using the star scale.  Truthfully, I would rate this store something different every time I visit.  \n\nHere's the deal, it is no doubt a cute, fun, trendy shop and it is a great alternative to the mall and some of the other mainstream locations...BUT I think you have to be a certain size and able to wear a certain style to really shop here for the most part.  That may be because I am 5'll so I always seem to have that issue but overall I think this boutique best fits a more \""petite\"" woman!\n\n I do love the dresses in their summer collection and I have a couple that I pretty much lived in this year but some of their items are a little on the tacky side.  They are a sister to the store \""Julies\"" and I don't know if any of you remember Julies but it used to be at Carolina Place Mall.  It was somewhat cool at first but then it turned into more of a dress barn type store...tacky and frumpy.  I see glimpses of Julies in Ivey and Leo from time to time.  It is as if Julie is their ugly stepsister that they try to keep hidden but she surfaces every now and again.  \n\n I also think it is slightly hit or miss, although, most boutiques are.  I was in there a couple times during Christmas break and there was a very limited selection...even with the jewelry.  There are times when I walk in and try on 20 things and other times that I walk out in 5 minutes because I find everything to be brutal.   \n\nEven though I have gone back and forth about this place, I do like it here and I will always make it a part of my shopping routine.  For the most part they have great accessories and at least one or two fun items to try on.  Another plus is that they are pretty affordable and the quality is good for the price!  \n\nIt is definitely worth stopping by...if you don't find anything you like, try back in a couple months because you may have a different experience!  :)"
0;Being ignored for 10 minutes in Las Vegas when you are two girls at a bar is highly unlikely. But the older, heavier bartender at the heart bar is doing a great job in just that - topping it off with a 'seen-it-all'- I've had enough - jaded attitude that's not the charming kind but the one that makes you walk away. Which is exactly what we did after he walked away while we were ordering. \nI was a bartender, cocktails mixer, waitress, hostess for a few years and know the game. \nThe game of the bartender of this bar (working in 09/11/14) was absolutely unacceptable.
2;Nothing fancy, no frills. Just needed a place to crash for 1 night while visiting. Room key was a bit hard to work. It seems to read easier if you pull slightly downward when sliding the card out. Staff was friendly. Place was reasonably clean. Helped to have free wifi, parking and continental breakfast included. About what I expected for under $50/night motel.
0;"I've eaten here several times over the years, and was never impressed. We ended up there again after a 4 year gap, and the food was a poor as I'd remembered. Service was OK, the mens toilets had red buckets under the urinals.\n\nMy friend summed it up as \""I suppose it might be OK if you were pissed\"", but I doubt it."
2;Went to The Penguin after hearing about it from coworkers.  I was expecting a dive so I wasn't surprised, but it really wasn't that bad.  The burgers weren't really what we like, we aren't fans of pimento cheese which seems to be in a lot of the burgers.  The burgers were good but not fantastic like we had heard.  The fried pickles were really good with (I believe) homemade ranch.  The fries were awesome, stayed hot for a long time, super crunch.  Everything came out PIPING hot....which sucks when your really hungry:)  I don't know if we will be back but it was worth a try.
1;"I ate at Umami on Wednesday, May 1, 2013. \n\nFOOD 3/5\nI ordered tea, a summer roll appetizer, and dumplings. Below are the menu items I ordered, with my opinion of each.\n\n\""Summer roll  $5 assorted vegetables, peanuts, sesame, herbs and tofu wrapped in rice paper with spicy peanut sauce\""\nThe summer roll was very pretty, but also very bland. I didn't detect any significant quantity of herbs or seasonings, and 90% of the filling was plain white cabbage. The peanut sauce was acceptable, but I've certainly had better.\n\n\""Dumplings (six for $6 / nine for $8) choice of one sauce per order: soy vinegar, sweet or spicy sauce -- pork and chives, the classic, with Taiwanese cabbage, Chinese chives, and ginger\""\nThe dumplings were very good. The balance of filling to wrap was just right, and they were browned on one side, providing both the taste of a fried dumpling along with the soft texture of steamed dough. I wanted to order a variety of dumplings (ideally three of each kind) but that is not allowed, so I only got one type.\n\n\""Tea\""\nIt was served in a pretty 4 oz cup, extremely hot. It wasn't anything to write home about, but it was a Japanese style green tea. (It's frustrating to eat at an Asian restaurant and have European tea, or Lipton, and they didn't do that.) I would have preferred a small pot with my tiny cup, or failing that a medium sized cup.\n\nSERVICE 1/5\nI found the service to be severely lacking. \n\nWhen I entered the establishment, it was early in the evening and there were only 2-3 customers. The first employee I saw simply looked at me and walked behind the bar. The second simply looked at me. After being stared at for a few seconds, I said, \""I'd like a table, please\"" and she said, \""OK.\"" After a few more seconds of standing there silently I said, \""For one\"" and she said, \""OK\"" and lead me to a table. During this conversation a number of other employees hung around behind the bar having a personal discussion. I certainly don't begrudge employees some personal talk while business is slow, but I mention it because the unenthusiastic hostess and preoccupied staff combined to give the impression that my visit was rather a burden. \n\nAfter I was seated a waitress asked my left shoulder what I would like to drink. (I may be exaggerating a bit when I say that she was speaking to my shoulder, but when sitting alone at a table with no other people or furniture in the way, I rather expect anyone speaking to me to stand somewhat in front of me, aim their body in my general direction, and look roughly toward me. I think the only time I saw her face was when she eventually brought me a bill.) I was driving and not planning to drink alcohol, so I asked if soft drinks were on the menu. The waitress said, \""Yes. No. We have coke products.\"" I asked for tea, which she agreed to, but later discovered that they carry specialty sodas and other nonalcoholic beverages.\n\nI would have liked some more tea, which I didn't get. I would have liked some more water, which I didn't get. I would have liked a bowl of ramen, which I didn't bother to order since I didn't really feel welcome.\n\n(Edit: I did receive what I ordered, and I did leave a 15% tip.)\n\nATMOSPHERE 3/5\nThe building, decor, lighting, etc. are pleasant and attractive. While my preference may be for Japanese music, the indie rock they played was unobtrusive, inoffensive, and commercial free. Most important, the volume was just right, audible, but not so loud that it would overpower conversation.\n\nPRICE 3/5\nPrices are exactly what I would expect for this type of restaurant in this location. Happy hour from 5:00-7:00 Monday-Thursday offers 2 for 1 beer, sake, and rails.\n\nOTHER\nThe menu includes clearly labeled vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free items in each category.\nParking is available on site (not the case for most businesses in this neighborhood) as is a bike rack.\n\nDespite my lackluster first impression, I'd like to try Umami again someday. I like their menu, and by all accounts their ramen is very good. It's possible that I simply visited at a bad time."
0;Don't go here at all even for an oil change. Went in for an oil change and they were trying to sell me a new water pump because mine was bad. Took my car down to the dealership and it checked out okay. Word of advice before getting anything done by Midas make sure you double check else where!!
0;"Fresh...not! Went here years ago when they first opened and was impressed. In the neighborhood and remembered them so decided to try again. Major disappointment. The dish I remember best no longer on menu. Order beef chimi. Yuck! Filled with unseasoned ground beef and covered with what looked like (and tasted worse than\"" Cheez-Wiz.."
4;I love their all you can eat sushi here... I wish they would put one in southern cali because this is THE restaurant to go to.  No matter what you order it is delicious and you can eat as much as you can of it!
0;Terrible service. Had an appointment for manicure/ pedi. the pedicure was nothing more than a feet wash!  the entire service (polish included) was done in under 10 minutes although I was the ONLY one in the shop and the attendant had no other hurry. the same with the manicure. it was fast and sloppy. would not go back to this place.
2;"I ate here twice this week while I was in Scottsdale on business. I always try to stop at White Chocolate Grill when in Scottsdale. Service is great. Sometimes too fast between courses and I have had to send food back so I could relax between courses. Not sure if they kept it warm or prepared fresh. They always appear to have sufficient staff and they are always busy. Watch the bill as they like to up charge for \""rocks\"" in your cocktail even if not ordered straight up. Not a big deal but annoying."
1;"More like 2.5 stars.  This place is ok.  Nothing special.  A bit pricey.  \n\nWent here with my cousin and a bunch of friends on one of many Vegas trips.  My cousin was super excited because she had seen it on Rachel Ray.  I've never watched Rachel Ray, but if this is the kind of place she recommends, then I cannot trust her opinion.\n\nThis was another one of those \""it's more about saying you've been there, rather than the food\"" type of places.  A lot of things on the menu sounded great.  \n got the Chicken Enchilada Omelet.  It was ok.\nI forgot what my girlfriend ordered, but it sounded fantastic on the menu.  It was ok.\nMy friend ordered pork chops and eggs.  Looked great.  He said it was ok.\nMy cousin and her hubby ordered whatever it was that Rachel Ray had ordered.  She was spouting off about how great it was, but honestly, it didn't even look that good.  Her enthusiasm seemed forced.\nThe other members of our party weren't very pleased with their breakfasts either.\n\nThis place is only open until 2 pm.  So you better get there early.  Don't worry about me holding up your table though, because I won't be back.  I'll be at Blueberry Hill, on Flamingo Rd., enjoying a very good breakfast for about half the price."
0;Kenny is extremely rude.  I order from here on a weekly basis and every time he asks me not to pay with my credit card because it takes too long.  I'm sorry Kenny this is the 21st century and I don't carry cash.  Tonight when I called and said hold on I need to grab my card (my fault I thought I knew where it was when I dialed) he responded with we are too busy.  You are two busy to take an order and get money??  Then I found it and started to read my card.  When I got to the third set of numbers he said hold on I need to go cook.  Excuse me?  Do not answer the phone if you need to be cooking.  You my friend lack in customer service.  The gentleman he handed the phone to was extremely kind, as all of the other employees are there.  If it had not been for him I would have hung up and taken my business elsewhere.  I think in the future I may do just that.  Kenny if you are going to own a restaurant learn how to treat your customers.  Especially ones that order frequently.
3;The Sweet Potato Curry with tofu (substituted for chicken) was a wonderful post-workout meal. The sauce was rich and flavorful (you decide the level of spice) with plenty of vegetables. I've eaten at the Fitchburg location several times, so I was overjoyed to see them open in my neighborhood. The space is quiet and comfortable with a mix of booths and tables. Place your order at the counter and they bring your meal to your table.
2;Ok so this was my first day club in Vegas so I decided 3 stars..i had a blast but accomodations weren't that great. I had no idea you had to be there super early to get a good spot. We stood in line for a bit, had no idea Nicole from PussyCat Dolls was celebrating her birthday that day. It was JAM PACKED. The pool is super tiny and the best way to go is cabana. We found a spot right by the palm tree and we couldn't all go in at once because someone would've stolen our shit. My friend and I jumped in the pool which is warm and definitely NOT clean. Don't go in there if you don't want to get your hair wet, there are many splash sessions.\nThen we saw someone puke in the pool and that's when we didn't go back in...that is overboard. \nThe drinks are super expensive...$$$. I definitly had a blast going to my first day club but its better to get a cabana and get there early.
4;$1 Mondays are most awesome!  Checked out with 8 pieces of clothing w/tax+10% off related to their new loyalty program=$7.78= 90 cents/piece!  :)  Fitting rooms available.  FYI just inspect each piece as you would any other store.  :)
4;Absolutely beautiful. Quiet, serene (that's the same as quiet, isn't it?), and green. Hard to believe there's a large area of grass/trees in the heart of Henderson, Nevada. \n\nThe country club is pretty, especially the main ball room where you have a beautiful view of the golf course and houses. You can also see the Las Vegas strip from there during the night which is gorgeous. \n\nThe architecture is modern, classy and comfortable. I'm not an expert of country clubs but this one, I rank it up there.
2;It really deserves a 3.5 but not quite sure it is a 4 out of 5. The salsas were not my favorite but the chips were really good. They have some good happy hour choices  in appetizers and drinks. However, the sangria was not very good. \n\nThe barbacoa tacos which used lamb were really tasty! This was not something I have had in the past (lamb barbacoa). It could have been shredded a bit more but it was good. And there was tons of it. You could definitely share a plate with someone if you have some chips and salsa ahead of time. The shrimp tacos al pastor were also  very good and provided tons of food! The salad/pico de gallo side which you can get instead of rice or beans is decent also. \n\nWould I come back? Maybe. It was decent for sure. It is just a bit dark in the restaurant and not in a fun, trendy or romantic sort of way. It just seems a bit depressing. \n\nThe service was also decent.
4;"This review was started years ago, and all I wrote was \""I loooove\""\n\nIts my go-to brunch spot, every time I stay at the Wynn tower suites.  And thats where I've stayed the past 4-5 Vegas trips!  I loooove Wynn tower suites, coming out of the elevator to Tableu, getting seated right away, cute striped cushions, fine dining service without the stiffness.. just the entire experience.  \n\nThen.. delish food:). Everything I had was immaculate, and simply so yumm.  Don't forget to get fries, they serve it with homemade ketchup.  Its a bit more tomatoey, some tartness, and absolutely divine.  I love my waffles there, French toast, the pancakes, crab cakes, the potatoes, homemade jam.. I can go on & on.  And freshly \""squeezed\"" Watermelon juice!  Trust, splurge on it!\n\nI usually sit indoors, but you'll find me outside when the weather is warm with a slight breeze.  Plus, its nice seeing the private pool area for those (me included!) with a tower suite key\n\nPs. I'm the 100th review for Tableu, yay!"
4;I am so glad that I read previous reviews and ordered what other people ordered. This was my Husbands and my first time trying Ethiopean food. We have been talking about it for at least 2yrs so needless to say I was very excited to try this place while we were in Las Vegas. We ordered the Vegetarian Combo and the Kitfo, as well as the puff pastry appetizer that was filled with lentils. EVERYTHING was amazing! The Injera made for an overall great dining experience.  All of the staff was very friendly and attentive. Don't let it's humble outward appearance fool you. If I had to change anything it would be to have cloth napkins and maybe some updated menus. Overall a great first time experience and we will be returning!!!
4;We have Yard House here in Denver and like to go there for a decent, sit down meal or a good happy hour. \n\nWe ate here on our last day and couldn't decide where to go, so we went here cause we knew it would be good. \n\nService was good. But seemed long time periods between checking on us. \n\nWe both had the 1/2 salad, 1/2 sandwich. He had the french dip and really enjoyed it. I had the Roasted Turkey Club. Thumbs up. \n\nWe love the Onion Ring Tower. When we do happy hour drinks and apps, we ALWAYS get that one. \n\nLots of TVs for sports. Large booths, high top tables, large menu, TONS of beers to choose from.
3;Kinda scary how they were able to cut and program me a new key that bypassed the built in 'immobilizer' security system in my car but for 40 bucks it was a better deal then taking it to the Acura dealer and paying an assload.\n\nAlso had them program me a remote that cost 40 bucks. This is seriously overpriced. would have been reasonable at 15-25 but 40?? and all he did was take an instruction sheet from a binder to do it...40 bucks...come on I BROUGHT IN THE REMOTE. other then that service was quick. was in and out in under half an hour
3;Perfect staff! Lovely food! Casual neighborhood atmosphere! Great place!
4;OMG!!!  Best pizza ever!!!  I am in pizza heaven.  A definite must if you are in Vegas
4;"By far best Italian food in the area. Perhaps best Italian food I have had in my life. The hospitality by Mr Franco makes the experience even more memorable. Veal and halibut were exceptional. Dessert screams \""yummy.\"""
0;This rental car agency in Charlotte is a joke.  We arrive in Charlotte and wait in the rental car island to be picked up for an hour and 45 minutes.  Then we find out we are supposed to wait in a different area and wait for a bus that says Pre-Flight.  Like we were suppose to know this.  Find a different rental car agency.
4;I had Lasik this afternoon. It's now 8:43 PM. I just woke up from my post-op nap and I'm the happiest dude in Tempe. I haven't been able to see this well since I was a little kid. There's nothing like standing in my backyard and staring up at the finite features of the moon through my own eyes.\n\nLasik itself is great but obviously I'm not reviewing a surgery. This place deserves five stars for four major reasons. 1.) They were overwhelmingly friendly from the minute I walked through the door. 2.) They did a fantastic job preparing me for what to expect. 3.) I arrived at their office at 2:15 pm today and was done w/ surgery by 3. I know some people might think that sounds a little cold and impersonal but it wasn't. The doctor was extremely friendly and as soon as I shook his hand I relaxed completely. 4.) This surgery cost me 700 DOLLARS TOTAL! I responded to a banner ad they were running on Google for 299 per eye. I assumed it was a bait and switch. For me, it wasn't. I understand that everybody's eyes are different but I qualified for that price.
1;This club definite played some of my favorite music while here in Vegas, so you would think that the rating would be higher.\n\nBeing around Vegas you can tell which clubs are the top tier and which ones are on the last legs.  This one is part of the latter.  The place is pretty small and uninspired.  We were here in town after NYEs and on a night with a UFC fight in town on a Saturday Night.  The service seemed inattentive, and for the most part was just standing on the level behind our table, so really no one would be there to pour our drinks, since we did order bottle service.  I thought this place would be more packed, but really it wasn't.  \n\nIf you want just an A-OK time come through.  If you want to experience Vegas like in the movies, go somewhere else.
0;"Visited on 10/11/14 and will never return. It took forever for our waitress to even acknowledge us and ask for drink orders. We told her we were ready to order which we did but she wrote nothing down and asked us immediately after for the order again. Use paper and pen next time girl. THEN while waiting FOREVER for our food we hear her cussing the cooks out regarding our order and she stated that her tip will now be fu*%ed because our food was late. LOL smh. We asked for more water twice and more bread. She brings the water pitcher and leaves it on our table??? No bread. After 30+mins we asked for a manager. The manager comes with our food but tells us \""I wanted to wait a few more mins for your order before coming over to you\"" Smh once again. The manager told us that our meal was comped and offered dessert to which we declined. We just wanted to get out of there. We should've paid attn when we walked in because the manager was walking a familiy out apologizing for the bad service. I wonder how many tables had comped meals that night. The food is less thatn mediocre and the staff sucks. The only person who seemed to care was the hostess."
0;"Easily the worst \""burrito\"" I have ever had.\nIt amazes my that anyone would choose to eat at this chain. I bet the rations they serve from the back of UN trucks to refugees is better."
0;Did not even get to a table, despite having called an hour before and asked for a table for 7 at 7! The female on the phone told me that they were not taking any more reservations but for us to come on in and they would seat us.\nUpon arrival there was no greeting from any of the staff. I walked up to the person who seemed in charge and had to get his attention as he was more involved with another (yawning) employee.\nI won't go into any further details but I see the common thread about poor service in all the reviews! I concur.
3;Liked it the first time so I made reservation to dine there 2nd time around.  Top notch qualify.  Steaks were great, seafoods were great, banana bread beer was awsome.  Chocolate dessert is to die for.
4;U want it fast... you want it now!!!!   come here!
0;Wow, What a really small place for a restaurant.. They should really think about a bigger place.. I felt like i was in a sardine can.\n\nOn to the food,.  If you love salt go here,. Every dish is loaded with tons of salt! With Heavy grease on the side.. The owner apparently is vietnamese so you can expect very subpar pinoy dishes. There are a lot better pinoy food places in las vegas. DT's is probabley the worst filipino food in las vegas. Fiesta Filipina on st Rose and Eastern is the closest to real pinoy dish i have found in las vegas.
3;"How could you not love a place known for strombolis? This place is a hidden gem outside of the strip that I've been wanting to go since they were on DDD.\n\nThey have a few different kinds of stromboli (and even a breakfast one!!!!). Between me and a few other people we tried a 3 of them and I have to say the meatball one is by far my favorite. We tried the beef and cheese one (or something like that) and the original one (or something like that) and the meatball was really just perfect. The small size is good for a normal person, but if you're like me, the large will do. Actually splitting a large stromboli between 2 people is the best deal. If I remember correctly, the small was around $8.95 and the large was $11.95. \n\nService was pretty decent here and the food was prompt. We got a couple appetizers including cajun fries, which were basically fries in buffalo sauce...I don't really recommend this. Just get the regular fries. We also got the fried mac and cheese or whatever it was. That was awesome. I would get those if I went again.\n\nAlso if you get a beer, it comes in this ice cold mug that makes it one of the most refreshing beers. Or if you're like my sexually confused friend and want a bloody mary, they have those too. It was actually my first time trying a bloody mary and it was pretty good...note to self: don't get \""buffalo-ed\"" when you're having one...it's not a fun drink to chug. If you don't know what \""buffalo game\"" is, look it up.\n\nIn conclusion:\nGet a large stromboli for 2 people.\nGet the fried mac and cheese or whatever it was\nGet a beer.\nGet the meatball stromboli"
4;"LOVE this food truck!!!!!!!!   It's not like ANY other food truck out there!!  So original!!!!  I mean PHO from a truck??  And not not just pho;  FRESH poke! Lobster balls! Brisket sliders???\n\nEVERYTHING my husband and I tried was delicious!! The Pho was amazing!!!  We ordered the wa da pho!  Best beef broth ever!  Tasty without msg!   My husband ordered another bowl when we finished with the first!\n\nDa lobsta ballz- soooooooo addictive with their dipping sauce.  \n\nWhen we were there they had a special dish, spicy poke!!!!!  So mouthwatering good!!  Some of the freshest poke I've ever had....and it came from a truck!\n\nI can't wait to go back and try the other items on their menus!  \n\nDefinitely a must try. If you see this food truck parked somewhere, do yourself a favor and stop by."
4;We rented a house in Summerlin for a month and my husband researched a good deli. He found a total WINNER! We went to The Bagel Caf\u00e9 atleast 2x a week. They have an awesome bagels and deli selection with fresh sturgeon, lox and turkey! We also enjoyed lunch there! We will miss this place when we go home!
2;I got the Prime Selection Ribeye steak medium rare for $36. The sweet spot was about the size of a silver dollar and the rest of the steak was fat and tough meat.  My sisters got the prime rib and filet.  Both were exceptionally good.  The service was good too.
1;Nothing is more frustrating than having to get up and ask for silverware so you can eat your food. The burger was nasty guess I should have just stuck with breakfast for lunch. Very disappointing! My son ate his whole plate so guess the pancakes were good. Don't like this location at all! I'll stick to the one one lake mead. Not to mention the restrooms are disgusting!
2;If you told me Matt Groening based at least some of Comic Book Guy and his Android's Dungeon on Other Realm, I would totally believe you. I have had many friends tell me I am brave that I would shop there and that they went in once and would never go back. I totally understand this. The owner is kinda scary (take Comic Book Guy, add 10 years, gray hair, biker mentality, and crazy stories), and if you don't join in his crazy conversations, he kinda acts like he doesn't want you there.\n\nI will explain my 3 stars though. Other Realm gets one star for convenience (so close to campus that you can just walk there after class), one star for a very well stocked quarter bin FULL of great reads, and one star for an awesome Free Comic Book Day policy (instead of giving away the books every one else does, he stockpiles books that didn't sell too great during the year and you can take one of each).\n\nOverall, go to Other Realm if convenience is your biggest factor. If you have a car, go to G-Mart.
2;I like Hooters. Maybe that's what jades my opinion of this place... but I just really don't like the girl's outfits.  And I'm a lesbian!!  I just think it's too much skin to be appropriate... the girls at Hooters at least leave something to the imagination. Two stars for the outfits.\n\nThe food is pretty good... four stars for the food.  Drinks... 4 stars as well... they have great happy hour specials.\n\nI had the pastrami sandwich and it was really good... huge sandwich... I took half of it home.\n\nOne thing that kinda weirded me out was when I went to the restroom... walk in and it smelled like it was a club night. The air was full of perfume... weird.  Then I finished up and there was a single woman's mary jane shoe... no doubt one of the server's shoes.  Just weird.
3;Went here two times in the same weekend we loved it so much!  Rafael (one of the managers) was very gracious and accomodating to our party. He brought us several appetizers to try-the walnut shrimp, bacon shrimp poppers and philly cheesesteak dumplings.  The dumplings were my favorite and everyone else really loved the walnut shrimp (I'm allergic to nuts to I couldn't try them).  I shared the french dippity doo with one of my friends and it comes on hot challah bread-divine.  The rest of our party loved their food as well.  \n\nI'd highly recommend the Cherry Popper Panty Dropper (drink) very yummy and refreshing and end your meal with their homemade donuts!  They are unlike any donut you've ever had!\n\nWe loved it at First and we will be back each time we visit Vegas!
3;My friends and I came here for a birthday lunch get together and the service was wonderful. I ordered the tamales which was overpriced but it is from a restaurant so understandable. It was mediocre but the salmon I ordered was delicious !!! My other friends who ordered the burgers were less impressed so I was very happy with my choice. Not to much to choose from the menu for lunch so I recommend coming here for dinner instead.
3;Typical bagel shop.  Great coffee!  Good variety.  Gets slammed just about everyday.  They offer egg substitute or egg whites as well, so you can take in those extra empty calories in the bagel and save on the egg.
2;Good ribs and big portions!!!  service is always good too.
2;This place is difficult to get a same day dinner reservation so I tried it for lunch.  It has a very unique menu. I went heavy on the Tuna dishes.  Right now I will give it a 3.5 and after I revisit and try some more items on the menu I will re-post. Definitely worth a visit if you find yourself in the neighborhood.
0;I've had my mail come here for three years.  I've received many packages and been in every week.  Last year they had me provide a fresh copy of my ID, etc. after having apparently lost it.  Today I forgot my keys and asked them to open my box and get me my packages.  They refused saying they couldn't verify I was the holder.\n\nI had them pull the paper file of the ID, etc.  They had lost everything I provided.  I wonder where this personally identifiable information went - twice.  They tried to make their refusal to provide the name of the box holder appear to be about them complying with federal law.  Sillyness.  \n\nCome on guys, pull yourselves together.
4;"OK so you;ve heard it over and over but the best bread pushing can be found here. Not to mention really nicely prepared seafood, both cooked and Crudo. Pasta- which is always hard to beat. I know it's a lot of gushing but this place is a go-to. Wanted to try a bunch f other places in Charlotte but it keeps calling me back."
1;Have been frequenting Nikki Lee's for many years. Always go for their pizza and strombolies. The food has always been wonderful. Recently, new ownership has taken over and the qualtify of food has really suffered. The pizzas come out with reduced toppings, over cooked and just not good. The service is usually very good, but, recently it has suffered too. Really sad we are going to have to find a different place.
4;This is the BEST date place and just going out with friends place!! Food is yummo and the employees ROCK! I go as often as I'm able to get there.
3;I went again for dinner. I enjoyed my local-fruit cocktail, veggie burger, and the deviled eggs. (However, why does somewhere like this -- that seems like an innovative place that loves it veggies, only have a veggie burger as an option? Oh wow, haven't seen THAT before) Waitress was nice. The atmosphere is still pretty spectacular.
2;Decided to try Bamboo club today - hadn't been there in years and we were looking for a close by place for a family birthday lunch.  Service was really really slow - we were seated and had all decided on what to eat before we were even asked about drinks.  Then once finished I finally had to flag down someone to get our bill and it took them a few tries to get us our bill and credit card back.  Not impressed with the service and it wasn't very busy.  Chicken lettuce wraps were great.  I ordered the lemon grass chicken which was good but a lot spicier than I thought.  My husband's mongolian chicken was over sauced and it tasted like a jar sauce.  Food was ok, but nothing special.
0;I've been to Jimmy's a few times and have given up on it.  The first experience was just really awful- like include salad with your order and wait twenty minutes for it to arrive awful.  (Nor were they really busy, so no excuse there.)\n\n  The second time I ordered a sausage dish.  The crack brain trust that runs the place basically put it on a dish/saucer that wasn't big enough to move the thing about easily, so eating it was not as simple as you'd expect, nor was it a particularly memorable sausage.  The third time was the best of the three but they simply didn't have it in them to recover the interest and good will that earlier visits had cost them.\n\n Avoid.
0;"Biggest let down since \""Yes We Can.\""  Not good when you leave depressed and with an empty wallet.  J.A. shouldn't get a pass for this. Low light: cheap tasting $12 margarita"
4;I'm writing this review based on training and shopping experience.  I've never had to groom, board, or use the vet facilities here though all look great.\n\nThe training here is the best in Charlotte. Mr willie is wonderful- he turned my rambunctious crazy pup into an off-leash walker in less than 6 months. We started in his beginner class, went through intermediate and advanced, and are now in therapy dog classes, looking forward to taking the therapy dog test soon. Willie can help you with any problem, from drooling to chewing to car sickness to aggression.  He's the Caesar Milan of Charlotte. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
0;entered a 1 star only because they provided a roof over our heads. looking for a place to get diarrhea fast? go here. walked into 3 employees playing hangman, ignored us when we needed to be seated until I pulled the old *ahem* move. Sat down to have watered down sweet tea, babies crying, and the grungiest of the grunge eating next to us. The food... BLEGCK!! Everything was over cooked, sticky white rice, the egg drop soup was cold, everything was horrible. So bad in fact, we left. There were little desert squares that looked like they could be lemon bars, AVOID THEM, they smelt like locker room feet. All in all, i would never recommend this place, no matter how hungry, hung over, or cheap you are! *see attached picture
0;Attention: if you pay cash***** watch out for heavy set Hispanic lady. I counted out the money and handed it to her, she said I didn't give her enough. I know i did, so I asked for the money back to recount it and she hesitated because she knew exactly what she was doing!!! Stealing!! I finally got my money back and counted it again and it was enough!! This lady is a thief and pocketing money! I told the manager on duty what she was doing but she didn't seem to care.  Are you kidding me?? I will never go in her line again!! I would rather leave the store, leaving my groceries behind!!!
0;"I didn't go to Toby Keith's expecting great food or ambiance, but I did hope that his selection of 'country cookin' would be better than average, what with his cowboy hat and all. We were seated quickly (I'll give 'em that), but the service was anemic at best.\n\nThe food arrived, and my girlfriend and I sat there munching stoically without comment for a few minutes. We were both hungry, and even though I had several comments, I kept them to myself for that initial interval. Finally, she broke down and said \""Any good?\""\n\nI replied: \""Well, it tastes like the boot, right after Toby Keith pulled it out of Al Qaeda's ass!\"" - and then I illustrated my point by taking a sharp bite with my canines and holding it down for ten seconds, and showing her that I hadn't made a dent in the meat!\n\nToby, a couple of suggestions for you:\n1. Leave the jingoistic songs to someone who does *not* own a restaurant, and concentrate on upgrading your food from \""horrible\"" to \""barely passable\"" - this will be a huge step forward.\n2. If you must involve yourself with patriotic activities, please wrap care packages of your food and drop it off between the Afghan/Pakistan border. After two days, I'm positive they'll surrender. Your menu selections will do more damage than the MOAB.\n\nThey do take plastic and the monorail will drop you off pretty close, but I'd recommend going elsewhere, even if you're on your last vestige of strength and absolutely must eat. This restaurant has probably lost Toby more fans than his singing ever will."
2;"Tsom is definitely aiming for fresh, vegetarian and many gluten-free options, and in that regard it really does hit its mark! Yet, after all is said and done, the flavors are just lacking a certain tasty finesse that nearby restaurants like Haji Baba and Pita Jungle have mastered. Today, the cold/plentiful buffet, which is pay-by-the-ounce, featured a curry pasta salad with raisins, quinoa with raisins, cabbage curry salad (no raisins;), a mediterranean salad, a couple of Indian-spiced hummuses, lentil salad, and potato salad. Out of these options, I'd say I truly only enjoyed the lentil and potato salads because they had more substance and were a bit creamier. The quinoa, a mild-flavored grain in the first place, had a fresh, light flavor, but I tend to like stronger-flavored items. The curry pasta salad, also light in flavor... perhaps could have just used some more spice, and I would say the same for the cabbage curry salad. The falafel my friend I ordered was good, however. Add a little tahini to it, and ZAP! Instant delicious falafel. $6.99 gets you a pita, drink and french fries, which are spiced and add some tasty pizzazz to the meal. Ultimately, I think I'll just try their hot menu items from now on, but thanks for the effort, Tsom!"
0;Have gone multiple times. Bad service. Should not cost that much for such quality.
2;Its right next to Denny's so Im Just sayin...if you want better diner food come here to.... Get a order of Chicken Nachos and a beer  to stop that hangover chief.
3;"Great atmosphere! Country music, decor and dance floor, although it all could use a good dusting. Waitress was so cute and helpful. My highlight... I am from WI, 16 years in Green Bay, so pulling up to Packer flags waving a huge \""Packer Fans Welcome\"" banner and fried cheese curds and brat bites on the menu! Heaven! I've had better barbeque, but it really didn't matter!  I'd love to be there this Sunday for the playoff game! Go Pack and go to Buffalo Chip Saloon!!"
1;"Great deck- okay food, TERRIBLE service. I was just there last night- perfect night to enjoy the outdoor deck! What could have been a great night turned into such a frustrating ordeal because of the service which made me remember why I stopped going last year. I don't know whether they are consistently understaffed or whether they intend to hire the slowest people on the planet. I didn't feel as though it was outrageously busy- I've certainly seen it a heck of a lot busier than it was. Getting a drink was a monumental task, getting our waitress's attention required little less than tap dancing on the table to show tunes- and when we were finally able to flag her down we usually got the \""just a minute\"" finger with a look warning us that clearly she's very busy and we should really be more appreciative of her time. I was starving so I order crab cake sliders. Why? Apparently I like throwing my money away- that's why. They arrived just as I was trying to flag the waitress down (again) to cancel my order. They were okay- the bread was pretty stale but the crab cakes themselves weren't bad. Silverware would have really made my dining experience better (as I wasn't eating the stale bread). I was done with most of them when the waitress finally appeared again I got my check and had her wait when she finally returned with it so we could give her our cards. Then we went to P Stone- which is where we should have gone in the first place. Excellent service- great patio, much better food- I won't be returning to Kennedy's again unless I have no choice."
1;"Just because you pay more at Caesars Palace, do  not expect better accommodations or a more upscale crowd.  The rooms are mediocre, but clean.  The pool area is like an episode of  \""Jersey Shore.\"" Next time, I'll stay somewhere else."
0;Did not even eat here because the hostess was so pushy and annoying.  But turned out for the best because we decided to go to another restaurant and while waiting for a table, my gf and I played a slot machine and won $100 right before we got our table at FIX.  Thanks
3;Nice, clean, quiet. Was in LV for business and appreciated that this hotel wasn't crazy at all hours--also, non-smoking. Staff were very pleasant. If I were forced to go back to Las Vegas I'd probably stay here again.
1;The service has really gone down. It's a convenient location but I'd much rather travel across town to 99th ave if the service is better. The waiters take forever and aren't attentive in the least bit. It's almost as if they feel you are taking up space. Not to mention the fact that the last time I went, my friends and myself sat in the bar and they refused to serve us our food bc one out of five of us did not have their id. The manager states id is required to sit at a booth on the bar side, yet the sign that states this is on the back of the door that is standing wide open. So how do you expect someone to see that? And if that's the case, someone should stand at the door and card people. Very poor business practices.
2;J'ai ador\u00e9 le brunch. J'ai ador\u00e9 le fait que c'est un restaurant 'kid-friendly'. Mais j'ai d\u00e9test\u00e9 le service: lent, l'attitude du serveur, les manquements (pas eu d'eau avant la fin de notre brunch, par exemple). Bref, \u00e0 r\u00e9essayer peut-\u00eatre avec un autre serveur moins pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 \u00e0 adopter le style Hipster!
1;"I have to say, I DO like their food and the service is always pretty good. The atmosphere is great. HOWEVER, making reservations there is a different story. \n\nI had 7 people.. tried Chelsea's, Postinos, LGO... read below:\n\nMy grandparents were in town, and can't really \""wait at the bar\"" until a table is ready. They are old and tired. Hence, I tried to make reservations here, called 24 hours in advance... they told me they couldnt do it, but  to come in anyway and 'wait at the bar' for a table. I told them I was going to be with some older people, and asked if there was anyway we could just call in 20 minutes beforehand and put our name on the list, so my grandparents wouldnt have to stand at the bar. They said they didnt do that. Seeing as it THE EXACT SAME THING as coming in to put my name on the list and wait twenty minutes there, I dont see the problem. I asked them politely if they could make an exception considering the situation... they said absolutely not. Where I come from, restaurants will try everything they are capable of to accommodate their guests. This IS NOT what Postino's or the LGO owners do at any of their restaurants. After talking to Postino's, I tried Chelsea's and LGO and got the same answer.\n\nI also tried Chelsea's, which takes reservations for less then 10 but got the same story, they were booked and we could wait. Also asked them about calling in when we were on our way b/c I was with two older people who could not stand long... they said no way.\n\nI own two restaurants, I can tell you-- this is not appropriate customer service. Its also not very moralistic. If a frequent customer explains a situation, seeking a little help, and its not ridiculous, the restaurant shoud be happy to do it. \n\nSeems as if the LGO owners have taken a cue from Houston's... which is the type of place that gives Scottsdale a bad reputation. The type of service that scares out-of-towners away from Arizona because we are too \""snooty.\"""
3;Awesome cult restaurant in an old semi-dive casino. The food here is seriously good. I will be back until I try everything on the menu.
2;This place was profiled in LV Weekly a few months back, and specifically mentioned the beef roll pie, 8 Treasure Noodle, and the frog dish. While I'm intrigued to try frog again, I'll save that $16 dish for a dine-in visit as it doesn't sound like it will travel well.\n\nOpted for the noodle dish and roll pie, ordered by phone to pick up, was ready when I got there a mere 15 minutes later- interior of restaurant is a bit nicer than I expect, having been to a few places in this plaza already. \n\nNoodle dish was packed well with the noodles separate from the sauce- assembled myself at home, and though I'm not entirely sure of the components, I was okay with the overall flavor. Lots of cut up meats, what appeared to be beans, and shrimp in a brown gravy sauce. Aroma of sauce didn't initially appeal to me but taste was decent. Not a bad dish but not one I can see myself coming back for.\n\nBeef roll pie was a surprise with fresh herb inside- good mix of flavors and textures, and a good portion size for something I assumed was an appetizer and not an actual dish. Tasting this dish makes me curious about dim sum options here, though I decided against getting the XLB (reviews are mixed and I was not dining in).\n\nPortion price and quality for price are fair ($20 total and enough for 2 meals), d\u00e9cor is nicer and more upscale than expected, paper menu is not in keeping with these other aspects of the restaurant- not cohesive, but not an issue that will prevent me from coming back to try other dishes.
1;I always give a place the benefit of the doubt when I read such mixed reviews.  If something is stellar, then it is worth paying for..  This was not stellar.  In fact, it was more miss than hit.  We had 4 appetizers - the habanero & pickle was interesting and I would recommend it.  The squid which was mediocre to poor.  The farm bird lollipops were just ok.  The tuna poke was the one dish that was stellar.  We each had a glass of wine and that came out to $70.  Definitely not worth it with so many other fabulous restaurants in town.
4;"I was so totally blown away with this show from the moment we walked into the show room and we had great seats. I didn't know what to expect and was so thrilled that it was not a show with a impersonator! The show room, music, sets and cast were incredible and grabbed my attention from the first beat of Michael Jackson's music! So many songs were played that I had not heard in a long time, I actually had tears flowing through some of the memories they brought. This show is a must see if you have the opportunity. My son & I loved it and I hope to see it again in the future! \""Fabulous\"""
0;"well, sometimes \""little hole in the wall\"" places are very good and tend to surprise you... but not this place... The service was good and friendly, but the food was horrible. The orange juice tasted very bad, the gravy on the biscuits tasted like flour and water (paper mache) the bacon and mushroon omlet had a bad after taste... skip this place and go to ihop."
0;Pushy salesmen ate totally clues of any product or even what they carry.  Prices are just plain retail.  Not consumer friendly or helpful
1;After a few successful projects, I was sooooo hopeful that I FINALLY found a printer that was fast, efficient and reasonably priced.  \n\nMy hopes were shattered.  \n\nNew project: after sending over my info, attachments and needs via email twice, I heard nothing.  Crickets.  After a phone call to them and confirming that they got my email, I heard nothing.  Crickets.  \n\nSo next new project: a banner.  Maybe my last experience was a fluke.  Sent over all the info, gave them a call and confirmed they recieved my email.  Again, nothing.  Crickets.  I obviously never had it made there, but I did get an email response 3 weeks later (I'm not exaggerating)  Boo.\n\nI have since found another printer....good help is hard to find and unfortunately, you won't find it here.
0;"First of all, Johnny Chu should be ashamed to call himself a chef. He is barely a line cook. As stated in previous reviews, he doesn't even taste his own food (which accounts for the wide margin of variety a single dish may have on two different visits).\n\nSo, I made reservations, thinking I may be able to sit at the bar because I arrived 10 minutes early. Wrong. I was ordered to wait outside. Nearly 45 minutes later, and a drink at the bar next door, I inquired about my table. The girl didn't even look up at me to acknowledge I had said anything. After a minute or so of staring at her while she continued to ignore me, she finally said my table was ready. Hmm.\n\nThe food is horrible. I fear those of you who enjoy it, rather enjoy the \""atmosphere\"" and come here to be seen. The food is either completely bland (e.g., my curry, which tasted of water with a slight hint of something I couldn't even recognize) or so hot as to mask any possible flavor. By calling themselves \""authentic Asian\"" cuisine is just silly. There are so many hole-in-the-wall Asian restaurants that could cook Chu under the table blindfolded.\n\nSo, the rude, nonexistent service, the insanely overpriced food, and to be seen is what you're paying for. If you enjoy being treated like shit and fed food that I wouldn't feed in a troth for pigs--you may enjoy this place and good for you!"
3;I would've given a five star, but I feel there's room for improvement on the breakfast menu. There's not enough variety. I love Panera, and usually go there for lunch. Their lunch menu is very diverse. The Breakfast menu should be the same, or at least half as diverse as the lunch menu. Just my opinion. Anyway, I purchased an Asiago bagel (toasted), with roasted vegetable medley cream cheese. Very good! I had a cup of delicious Panera coffee that I made at home with it! Oh, the cashier that took my order was very friendly, and want afraid to smile! I love that! Well that's my 2 cents! Have a wonderful day!
2;Went on a monday night.  Got on the guestlist - so we didn't have to pay cover!\n\nGo early.  Got way too packed about 1am.\n\nDrinks weren't as expensive as I thought...  $10 for a huge Patron shot!  \n\nAbout $10 for a beer.\n\nWould be nicer with the pool area open.
2;"I had never been to an Arizona Blimpie, so I dropped in here this morning a little after 11 to see wuzup.\n\nThis is a good-sized place, seating about 60.  There weren't any booths, but the table seating & the dining room overall were comfortable & pleasant, with the place getting rather busy by 11:20.\n\nI ordered a 12\"" Hot Pastrami on Whole Wheat ($8.09).  It came with slices of Swiss Cheese onboard & the open face may have been dipped just quickly, at least on one side.\n\nThis place is no Capriotti's, but my sub and the service were both \""A-OK\"".     :-)\n\nOpen Monday through Friday."
0;"Atrocious customer service. If you can't handle the pressure of \""Restaurant Week\"" then perhaps you should reconsider participating in it. The self-proclaimed \""maitre'd\"" harrassed customers, and whether Veronica is aware of it or not, she comes off as completely passive-aggressive and unprofessional. A restaurant of this supposed caliber should not have people at the helm who haven't the slightest clue when it comes to customer service. Harvest should seriously reconsider the employment of an individual who will only drive business into the ground by destroying it's reputation."
3;Since we didn't know what to expect from this place, we ordered feast for two.  The ribs and chicken turned out to be very yummy.  Brisket..well, it was ok.\n\n*pork ribs = very yummy.  we will order full slab next time for sure!\n*atmosphere = very interesting - casual.\n*service = very friendly and nice
1;"I won't spend too much time on this review because I don't particularly want to relive my evening again, but I can say this was my second and last trip to Iruna.  Tomato bread had no tomatoes, calamari was soggy and had no flavor (had to ask for salt and lemon), and HH specials were not offered (only available at the bar/patio--despite not saying that anywhere on the menu or website).\n\nI'll give them credit for a solid snapper dish (at $5 a bite), and the server did recommend a nice tempranillo (although 2nd on his list behind the $15/glass of course).  The place was pretty empty until 9:00 on a Friday, and the menu is fairly limited and pricey for what you get.\n\nSome may enjoy this place, and although there was nothing traumatic about my dining experience Iruna is just a \""miss\"" for me."
1;Yeah, Jimmy really? Really? You ran out of the good bread at 1230. That is bush league.  Step your game up before places like Capriottis and potbelly take you over and you are lumped into the likes of subway and dare I say Blimpie! Oh then you have the nerve to not tell me to wait 5 min and there would be more instead of trying to whisk me through the line and get wheat. I can't believe you charge extra for that by the way. Place has gone down hill since sideburns left. I will go back and it better be fixed...or else i will probably have to find another jimmy johns somewhere else.
2;"We had a great meal and our waitress was a hoot. I can see why people like this restaurant. But you gotta be in the mood for a good old fashioned prime rib dinner, and no more than that. I can't imagine coming very frequently. The salad is so-so, not \""as advertised\"" when people are raving about it. My husband , who I consider to be fairly traditional in certain ways, hated the traditional decor including the silly waitress uniforms.  All in all a nice evening but I'd probably rather go to a steakhouse."
0;"After a 4-star worthy dinner at a restaurant in the Bellagio hotel, my party of four was looking forward to a delicious dessert and some prime people watching across the street at the Sugar Factory, located in the Paris hotel. We asked the hostess how long we'd have to wait for a table on the large patio overlooking the Las Vegas Strip and musical fountains of the Bellagio. We were told 30 minutes, provided a cell phone number, and proceeded to explore Paris until our name was called. Within 10 minutes we were called, headed back to the restaurant, and taken to a great table with fantastic people-watching potential. When I asked if we could have dessert menus, we were told the patio was for dinner dining only. When we explained that we were not asked or told that when we submitted our name, the lead hostess was summoned and we were informed that, since it was their mistake for not informing us, we would be granted an exception and be allowed to stay at the table. We promised to order lots of dessert! \n\nUnfortunately, that was when it all went downhill. The staff handled our seating situation appropriately, but the dessert we ordered fell woefully short of our expectations for, what appeared to be, the best place in town for a late-night sugar fix. Indeed, the dessert was so bad, we each took a couple of bites and couldn't go further. \n\nTwo in our party ordered coffee/decaf, which  impressively arrived with warmed half-and-half on the side. This classy touch was not indicative of good things to come. The other two in our party ordered cocktails and they enjoyed them. Much of the cocktail menu was comprised of huge sugar-laden drinks, which, although not for our taste, seemed appropriately Vegas and well-suited for a restaurant claiming to showcase sugar. \n\nWe thought it would be fun to share one outrageous dessert rather than order four smaller ones and the dark chocolate fondue fit the bill. It came with brownie bites, cake pops, strawberries, bananas, rice crispy treats, two kinds of cookies, and (oddly), pretzel bread bites for dipping. The platter arrived in a most unappetizing display. The chocolate was not particularly high quality and was not served in a fondue pot or other warming bowl.  The fondue forks provided were actually short wooden skewers.  Whipped cream was not provided as one would expect with dessert fondue. Moreover, the rice crispy treats and pretzel bread was stale, the brownies and cookies were cloyingly sweet, but otherwise tasteless, and the cake bites looked horrible and tasted worse: like raw sugar dough balls covered in smashed sprinkles. The entire platter looked and tasted like leftovers or day-old scrapes that never sold (and clearly should have been discarded). We pondered whether we were being singled out for \""taking\"" a prime table with a dessert-only order, but the consistently bad taste of every item on the plate and the hideous way in which the food on the platter was displayed led us to conclude that the Sugar Factory likely (shockingly!) cannot deliver high-quality dessert items.  We got the impression this is one of the places in a great location with a super view that feels it can skimp on quality and charge a lot for inferior food just because it can. We paid nearly 30 dollars for a plate of dessert that left a bad taste in our mouthes.  \n\nFortunately the pink-faced street performers and endless Vegas tourists provided just enough distraction to sweeten an otherwise disappointing experience. There's absolutely no way to sugar coat it: The Sugar Factory is not the place to go for a high-quality dessert."
4;We love Asian food so when we saw the reviews, we were hopeful. Yonaka is in a nondescript strip mall and from the outside doesn't look like a great dining experience. Are first impressions often wrong?  In this case totally!\nTonaka is tastefully decorated, modern but not overly trendy. Our waitperson was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. However the real star here is the food.  Everything we tried was delicious. The Asian blossom roll was amazing. \nWe are ourselves into a stupor and the cost was very reasonable.  4 thumbs up!!
4;Best Mexican food I've had in a long time. Good atmosphere.
2;it's kind of a neat experience! i've had much, much better ice cream but i've never had the option to fully custom make it fresh right in from of my face in a matter of seconds! \n\noverall, the experience gets more stars than the actual dessert. i would go back to take my nieces because they would think it was fun and cool, but i wouldn't go back for ice cream for myself...if that makes sense.
2;This was my first Burlesque show and it wasn't so bad. Unfortunately I attended the show with a friend who made it a bit awkward for me. Overall I liked the show. Very sexy, and funny. Honestly, the only reason I saw this show was because the tickets were cheap and O wasn't available that night. The show is very erotic. For adults only.
3;Niiiiiice pie and good beer on tap --attentive and friendly staff. Place was a-buzz so I had to eat at the bar. The small pie is plenty for even a big appetite like mine --no need for medium or appetizers.\n\nWould def go back or try other locations.
4;I just can't say enough good things about Michael Mitchell at Desert Mountain Spinal Care Shea. If your looking for a Doctor in the North Scottsdale area who knows how to take care of athletes, your search is over!! Reliable, Experienced, Knowledgeable, Professional, Convenient and MOST importantly- A nice guy with GREAT staff!! Thanks Doc for all your help the last 2 years. Feels so good to be on the mend.
1;"2 stars only because the food was alright but everything else a failure.\n\nSince we were already at Planet Hollywood for a show...we figured we'd check Groupon to see if any of there restaurants had a deal before dining. And hey what do ya know...Ocean One popped up. \n\nWalked in and immediately got weird vibes. No greeting from workers...but at the same time...couldn't tell who was working or not being that they were all in their own sweaters. Odd for a place that looks classy..from the outside.\n\nGet to our table which was also strange because they had a piece of butcher paper over a white linen table cloth.   Saving on linen cleaning? \n\nThere are some beautiful looking light fixtures throughout the restaurant but....none of them were on.  Saving on electricity?\n\nBasically....looked like it WAS a beautiful classy steak and seafood restaurant that was taken over by someone that has no clue.\n\nServer greeted us with 2 waters and a blank stare...then asked what she could get for us. I ordered a Pinot Grigio. My husband asked what was on tap and got another blank stare and \""um...we have Pinot Grigio....and....Stella and Blelue Moon\"". He orders his beer, and we both look at eachother in awe. What on earth was that?!? Lol. Weird.\n\nWe then notice our water glasses were filthy so my husband asked for another. Then we get our beverages and my wine glass had some disgusting stuff on it. Geez. Really?!?\n\nI know it sounds like we're drama diners but we really aren't. Just letting you know what to expect.\n\nI ordered the Miso Salmon..$18.99 and husband ordered the Chicken Breast $15.99. All in all...pretty good. No major complaints.\n\nGot our check and noticed they automatically put gratuity on there. So make sure you check it!! We usually tip more than what was included on there but because our server never bothered to let us know, we did not leave extra. Their loss.\n\nTry it for yourself but you get what you pay for. \nIts just an odd environment, we'll just say that Groupon got us in but, we won't be returning. Should've dined at the Oyster Bar just a few steps away."
4;I recently took the Grand Canyon tour around the Christmas holidays.   The tour guide was excellent.  He was full of fun and interesting facts about AZ.\n\nPeople don't normally think of the desert and think of snow or cold, but North Arizona is quite different than the desert. \n\nWe first took a short stop in Sedona.  Later, we continued north to see snow all around.  We traveled through Navajo country.\n\nWhen I finally got to the Grand Canyon, I took the helicopter ride around the canyon.  The view was magnificent.  It was one of the most breathtaking sites I've seen.\n\nI truly enjoyed my tour!  I will definitely do it again - especially if family comes in from out of town.
4;My girlfriend and I had the joy of coming here for lunch one Sunday a few weeks ago and was blown away by this awesome place.\n\nYou walk in and the place is different from room to room. It feels straight out of Ireland!  I've never been, but it feels like it.. so yeah.\n\nWe sat outside because the weather was perfect.  I've been to a pub over in Tempe Marketplace (forgot the name) and was not impressed with their bland food.  This time I asked what was good just to make sure. \n\nAs we sat and looked at our menu, something caught my eye.  Black Pudding.  Being a fan of shows like Bizarre Foods and Anthony Bourdain.  I knew what that was and it was time to try it.  I told my girlfriend what it was and she said she'd try it.\n\nFor those who dont know what that is.. it's Blood Sausage.. yep. \n\nI LOVED IT!  ...she hated it. lol.  I finished it off with some crackers and some sauce.  Just tasty stuff!\n\nWe split a sandwich and a salad for our main course.\n\nThis place was just wonderful and I cant wait to go back!
3;I thought we were at the Palm's guess not. Too drunk to remember much but I know the potatoes augratain were amazing calamari was sent back.
3;It is a casino after all but away from the strip, SW of las vegas. If you do want to get away from the strip this is one of the place, a bit pricey but I usually go here to watch a movie or cash my check which you can get some cool prizes. It is a station casino so you can get the rewards card, for a first timer you can win slot plays so wish you win. Parking is great, South and North parking lots.
4;I must say I was quite impressed with David and his company.  He came out to my house in Cave Creek at 4:30 and stayed until 7:00.  He provided me with an abundance of information regarding various pests and their habits.   He sprayed my entire front yard, back yard, garage, fence and even the walls around my house to protect me from anything and everything.   I have had 2 other exterminating companies and no one has ever spent as much time on the outside of my home.  He was very mindful of my young son as well as our dogs.  The definitely seem to be all about customer service and doing what is right for the customer.  I will make sure to recommend David and his company to my coworkers, friends and family.   Thank you Arizona Pest Squad.  Look forward to a long happy relationship as well as a pest free home!
4;What a great business.   They are raking it in.  3 steps - get a cup, choose your frozen yogurt, add toppings (lots of fresh fruit and regular old candy).   the fourth step that they forgot is paying, but it is surprising cheap unless you are
4;Love this store. In over 6 years of ordering from this Domino's, they have never disappointed, never been late, never delivered a crap product - and that says something. The Drivers are always fast and polite.  \n\nPizza Pro Tip: Do yourself a favor when you find a good pizza joint - tip the driver WELL. They will remember you, and your pizza orders will start to take priority to them. This matters because they get the opportunity to inspect your order before taking it to you. Leave a crappy tip or no tip at all, all of a sudden your pizzas start to be delivered cold, or of lesser quality. This is probably because they were delivering to my house first, and to the other houses that tip well. =)\n\nThanks El MIrage Domino's. You guys rock!
4;Anyone from Chicago has to go!  its just like one of the little hole in the wall type places in Chicago that has all the classic food with a new flavor and taste.\n\nTheir Beefs are AMAZING!!  The service was Amazing.  Billie was the nice lady working and she is a gem!  So nice and caring and very concerned about the appearance and performance of their restaurant.\n\nI have been back 4 times since and the food seems to get better.  It is a little pricey, but worth it!! You are supporting a real small business that deserves your patronage!  You must try a Beef from there.  It is a different sandwich than Al's, so it is tough to compare, but if you love classic Chicago Beef this is the place for you!  if you have never been to Chicago this is a true taste of it!
0;"I don't normally go out of my way to write a bad review, but for the situation I came across I believe it merits one to WARN future customers who come to this location for customer service.\n\nI came on a Saturday with an intent to buy a new phone in which the agent, Saul, assisted us with. Now, we were difficult customers to begin with because we could not completely understand the breakdown of charges they were going to give us based on various options. Saul was very nice and was very patient with us. But of course some things may be too good to be true as we all know that all agents here not only are required to provide good customer service as top priority but they also get commission. So agents will have their own agenda in mind.\n\nNow we were given a good option to take the Edge program where we make monthly payments towards paying off a new phone. However, Saul pitched to us (of course in a very nice and charismatic way) that with the program we would pay an up front price of $140 towards some sort of \""insurance to keep the phone in good condition\"" when we would have to trade it back one day. So we bought into this BS with our undivided trust on Saul to be very honest. With this \""insurance\"" up front cost came \""a series of retail products that come for FREE!\"" we were ecstatic! We were thinking we were getting a good value here!\n\nI went through my receipt when I got home realizing that I was charged $140 on retail products I didn't even want! Phone car charger, screen protector, phone case, and a $60 blue tooth device. WOW! So..that's what my insurance was. I was upset and felt completely taken advantage of as no one explained to us this \""deal\"" or option. I'm not quite sure if this is a Verizon sales tactic that this company trains them on or its purely developed by these agents but this is absolutely NOT COOL.\n\nI came back to speak to the manager nicely about our predicament in which he was willing to refund everything, but no apology, and instead decided to correct me \""it's a bundle option that goes with the Edge program.\"" Yes, FOOL I KNOW IT'S AN OPTION NOW! However, NO ONE DECIDED TO TELL ME THAT WHEN I GOT IT THE FIRST TIME. They pitched to me AS IF IT WAS NECESSARY. Being two women who came off as incompetent because we could not understand his breakdown, I felt completely taken advantaged of. So I am livid and would NEVER GO BACK.\n\nSo, be prepared to come in with your guard up on this one...and DON'T TAKE the \""bs bundle\"" unless you really really want it."
4;'Tis the season and I'm trying to shop local as much as possible...\n\nIt's challenging, however, to shop local particularly when on the hunt to furnish a nursery, and especially when you can find big box stores that carry anything and everything you could ever imagine at pretty low prices.\n\nWe're planning for the arrival of baby #2 in March, so I've recently been doing a ton of research on nursery necessities.  It hit me over the last few weeks that I needed to get my act together and order a crib and dresser.  The problem was, I had my mind set on ordering something grey, and since the gender of the baby is going to be a surprise, it had to be universal - not too masculine or too feminine.\n\nI did find a couple of local stores that carried nice lines, and of course there were also some options at big box stores like Buy Buy Baby and Restoration Hardware.  However, when an out-of-state friend of mine suggested I look into a particular crib she'd found, I did some more research, and that led me to Crismon's Baby Boutique.  \n\nIt turns out that Crismon's not only carries all kinds of children's clothing and accessories and specializes in Christening outfits, but they also offer competitively priced furniture and gifts!  I was very happy to learn that they work with Franklin & Ben, a really unique nursery collection that I initially found online and through my friend in Chicago.  When I called to inquire and learn more, I spoke to Lisa, and she was extremely helpful.  My husband and I went in and met Lisa in person and several days later, we decided to place an order.\n\nSo at the moment, we're playing the waiting game, but I can't wait to furnish the nursery with an awesome convertible crib and double wide dresser in a gorgeous weathered grey color from Crismon's.\n\nCrismon's is a family-owned business serving the Phoenix area since 1979.  Check their hours before you head over to visit, as I believe they are only open Wednesday - Saturday.  I'll update this review once I receive our purchase, but so far, I've been extremely pleased with the service I've received.  Fingers crossed for a five star update (and a five star baby too!)
4;"I have been in Vegas for 30 years.  Have not been able to find a decent hair cutter/stylist/salon in all that time.  After trying to grow my part very curly, part just wavy hair long, I was ready to just shave my head.  In one last ditch attempt to try one more hair cut.  I somehow found yelp.  There were so many great reviews about James at Beauty 2 Beauty.  I called him and he managed to squeeze me in that same day.  That was great because my Hubby and I had a big anniversary date the next day.\n\nI took a few pics of hairstyles I liked in and showed them to James.  He went at it.  Not too much later I had the most amazing haircut I have ever had.  I loved my hair for the first time in I don't even remember.  My Hubby loved it too.  \n\nI need color badly but he did not have the time that day, so he styled my hair to disguise the grey until I could come back.  Two days later I was back in the chair for color.  James suggested a color which was lighter than I had been using.  I trusted him enough by then to say \""ok\"".  Once again he was right.  It was beautiful, again.  Then he fine tuned the cut and suggested some highlights.  I was hesitant but said \""ok\"" once again.\n\nI am one hot Mama now!  AND I have a new stylist to boot!  I am on a fixed income and I could afford him.  James was fun to talk to, he could cut a great style in his sleep, and he is affordable.  I am in beauty heaven.  Thanks for steering me to him fellow Yelpers!"
3;We went on a Friday about 1pm and had a 10 minute wait. I had Roasted Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto. The waiter asked if I wanted a half portion with a salad. I didn't know I could do that and was glad he suggested it. A full bowl of Risotto would have been too much for me. My friend had Crispy Eggplant Pomodoro, which she enjoyed. The eggplant was cut in thick slices and wasn't overly battered. We also had a bottle of Chianti Classico, San Fabiano (Tuscany, Italy). The total bill was just over $60. I would definitely go again.
4;I have been coming to this place regularly for over a year now and the quality remains outstanding with phenomenal customer service. They have a huge selection of bottled soda and offer discounts for checking in on facebook. Well worth your business and better by far than any of your franchise burger joints.
3;I visited the Public House in early May. We had a nice, relaxing dinner. My girlfriend was a little disappointed in her meatloaf, but I enjoyed my meal (although I've forgotten what I ordered). Service was good.
1;Arrived and an hour wait just to check-in.  Lobby is hot, uncomfortable temp wise.  Very poor customer service so far, especially for the price.
3;Wasnt sure what to eat, but after checking out the menu we decided to try this place. It's located in the GVR shopping plaza.\n\nFavorite thing is they offer breakfast all day...since its also my favorite meal of the day I knew we would workout.\n\nOne lame thing is the check in offer. The way it's worded is you get 50% off beer and wine. Turns out its only advertising for the deal they already have...aka happy hour m-f 4-6pm. \n\nI had the favorite. It's a scrabble with goat cheese and roasted tomatoes and avacado (my fav). Comes with a side of potatoes-9.75. Next time, I wanna try the acai bowl! -6.95\n\nMy husband got the meat lovers. It's cheesy with bits of bacon and chicken. He said he would get mine next time. \n\nWe will be back, and trying different things
0;Extremely disappointed!!!\nWe lived in Charlotte and LOVED Bad Daddy's but their airport location does NOT do them justice.\nWe had a flight that stopped in CLT and we were excited when we saw that they had a location in the airport... I wish I never had that experience.\nHORRIBLE and again, EXTREMELY disappointed at the quality of the food.\nI am hesitant of ever recommending Bad Daddy's in the airport to any co-worker.
0;I walked in and asked one question and the clerk was unwilling to help and was also rude. It's worth driving the extra few blocks to hinkleys. As a manager of a retail store myself, this is a horrible way of handling customers and I doubt this place will be in business much longer.
4;So I go in two weeks ago and had some New Mexico potato pancakes. Served with pulled pork and avocado. Man I tell ya, I was chair dancing, it was sooo good. It's only on the weekend brunch menu. It needs to be on the regular menu. So as promised by manager Francisco, he would make it for me any time I came in. So in I go this morning, found out Francisco was working, and yes, I ordered the New Mexico potato pancakes and again, absolutely fantastic! Thanks to Francisco and his excellent staff. Very friendly!! I'll be back!
4;Best place in the world to get your nerd on. \n\nGames, competitions, tons of geeks, and lots of booze. The social engineer in me loved being one of the only chicks here, but the practical Vanilla felt a little eye-balled, especially since there was a reporter who was thrown out of the conference who resembled me (because she was a girl, and I'm a girl, and at the conference girls are few and far between). \n\nIf you go to this conference, you'll not only walk away feeling smarter, but more superior to everyone you meet for about a week. Plus, you can learn a lot of neat-o computer tricks.
2;"I have been to Turf twice now.. \n\nOnce for breakfast .. I got your typical English breakfast, cant say it was the best ive ever had, or memorable for that matter, but it was alright. My bloody Mary was good, but I swear the second one only had half a shot of vodka in it.. and if im wrong I am sorry, but I could only taste Mary mix. As my friend put it, the bartender was a \""charisma vacuum\"".. and yes, I didn't catch his name, but he wasn't cool at all. They had various sports teams playing on all the TV's, which is great if youre into that. \n\nSecond time I came I was with a group of extremely inebriated people.. and I FELL ASLEEP at the bar. I did not get kicked out, so 2 cool points for that.. I still cannot believe myself and how I got away with that I do not know. Either way, I remember a lot of weird shit going on, and everyone I saw, for the most part, was laughing. \n\nI have nothing bad to say about Turf, but I also have nothing to rave about. If you're hungry or want a drink and are in this neighborhood, try it out for yourself, and try to stay awake. Its a little embarrassing when you don't."
1;"Note: This is a review of the people and service at the door...it was so horrible my friends and I decided to not even go in.\n\nFirst of all, if you enjoy wearing ridiculous bling, sunglasses indoors and knock off Fendi, this is the place for you.  Yuck, not my sort of scene.  This place was trying waaaayyy too hard.  The area to get into this club was a mess of people with no clear crowd control.  We were given bracelets to get in...I didn't know they did that in Vegas?  Anyway, we didn't have to wait long, thankfully, but the guy at the front door was a douche.  We were a bachelorette party, all dressed impeccably (hey, it's Vegas, after all) and lookin' very cute if I do say so myself.  The only thing is the bride had a little veil attached to her hair.  It was her friggin' bachelorette weekend, for Christ's sake!  It wasn't an obnoxious looking thing, either.  Very cute, very tasteful.  We were told she would have to remove it or we wouldn't be able to go in.  Um, you just let in a P Diddy wannabe wearing a velour track suit and his entourage of video girl rejects and you won't let us in with a damn veil?  It's Vegas, asshole.  People go there to celebrate cheesy things like bachelorette parties.  I hate places that try too hard to be the \""it\"" place.  You're located in Planet Hollywood hotel...how cool can you possibly be?"
2;Good coffee & tea. A little loud on the radio and blenders constantly whirring... But good wifi and now that I know how to get there will use often...
0;I use to eat at the Village Seafood Buffet when I lived here in Vegas. I am in town on business and thought I would go there for dinner on Friday night. I was shocked I got there about 615 PM and there was no line. But the line did show up right after I got in so this was the only plus. \nI was so set back on how poor the taste of the food was. The crab legs were dried out in side, like that the reheated the legs that went used the night before. The deep fried fish was cold and slimy inside. I took one bite of the lobster and almost lost my cookies, I was worried that I was going to get hit with food poison but it did not hit. \nThen to top it off I grab some stone crab claws, I grab one cracked it open and it was all moldy inside. I saw that I was totally scared to eat anything, stayed away sushi, the rolls. \nThe only think that was ok was the claim chowder\nI will not be back after paying 48.00 for old dried up food. I should have went to the Bellagio Buffet, had split king crab leg and peeled shrimp for 10.00 less. \nI will not be back\nService was a 4 star and I wish I could give 0 stars for the food.
1;We were the only ones inside,  and had to get up twice to get someone to wait on us.  The food was good,  but with service like that...  monroeville location treated us much better.
1;We got a cold pizza!  We told our waiter who wasn't very personable and he said okay I'll take it back and reheat it. When he brought it back to us the edges were piping hot but the center was still lukewarm . So if you want lukewarm microwaved pizza then this is your place. They had maybe 15 other people in there besides us so they were not busy at all.
2;"This is the only Popeyes location I've ever been to, and I've only gone through drive thru. The strips are SO yummy - nice and crispy! The mashed potatoes are better than KFC I think, but they are super small. The biscuits are where it's at though. My husband loves their fried chicken, but neither of us can handle the \""hot\"" pieces."
0;Poor service and was not impressed by the food. Wait staff didn't seem interested when taking our order. I had breakfast, the eggs were burnt and rubbery and the pancakes has sat under the warmer too long and did not taste fresh. Definitely won't be back here
0;I'm surprised to see the amount of people who are pleased with this gym. Personally, I only gave it one star because it's not possible to give fewer.\nFirst, Randy the instructor, is a total ass. He is rude and arrogant. HOWEVER, I know I'm not going to like everyone I come across in this world, so I overlooked that.\nWe let them know on several occasions that there was equipment that was not working...which never got fixed.\nTo top it off, the first day my kids were in the child care, my son ended up having to get stitches because another child was swinging a scooter around in the air and hit him in the face with it. I'm sorry, but where the hell were the people who were supposed to be watching the kids???\nWhen we brought issues up to the Member Service people, they told us that they had had numerous complaints about all of these areas, but no one ever puts them in writing so nothing is ever done. Well, now it's in writing.\nIf I'm paying $150 a month, I expect better than this.
1;This review is for San Diego.  I was a member since two years ago.  Two years ago, that year was REALLY GOOD.  I went to about 4 San Diego symphony performances (good seats too), some dances  / ballet shows,  some random La Jolla music shows, it was REALLY GREAT.  Totally worth it.  \n\nThis year, not so good.  I am near the end of my 2nd year membership, there were only maybe 2,3 shows in the past year that were not too bad.  I ended up didn't go to any show in my 2nd year.\n\nDefinitely will not extend my membership.
1;I hate to say it but from what i tasted I would rather have Olive Garden. This is coming from someone who doesn't even like Olive Garden. \n\nThe live music was great, the older gentlemen playing were exactly who I expected to be in a place like this. \n\nThe bar is beautiful, I did not have any drinks but it didn't appear to be lacking a good selection. \n\nOnto the food. \nGarlic bread: the standard greasy garlic bread. It would have benefitted from a little salt but the shaker at the table was empty. \n Chicken Marsala: 4 oddly shaped pieces of chicken, which almost seemed like leftover scraps. Overly sweet and thick sauce that tasted like they buy it in. I found it strange that they served it with a side of spaghetti and red sauce but went with it anyways. That was a mistake, the noodles were al dente but the sauce was sad. No true tomato flavor, no depth, just bland. And the worst is when there's a pool of watery liquid underneath a nest of sauced pasta. \nMy friend had linguine and clams: according to them it was too much garlic and no real flavor. \n\nThe service was good, our waiter was professional and kept a very clean appearance. As for the hostess, she could use a little more personality. When a customer walks in it's best to say hello not stand and stare at them Until they say something. So really the only major thing lacking here is the food. Which is kind of a very important part of a restaurant. Unless that changes I won't be back.
2;Maybe i'm just not that artsy, but i thought this show was just okay. Granted my girlfriends & i had been drinking all day at the pool, so this was definitely a change of pace. I didn't follow any type of story, but some of the acro was cool. We were planning on going out to a club afterward to celebrate my friend's bachelorette party, but we were so tired from the serene music and dark room that we just went to bed.
2;I came here during a business trip after reading all the rave reviews.  Sadly, I was very disappointed...\n\nThe biggest disappointment is lack of selections.  The food is good, not great, for a buffet (which was expected).  For $5 less, I would definitely go to the Bellagio Buffet.  They have much better selections and tastier food!
4;For years I have been searching for a hairdresser who can give me a hair color I wanted. One would think that I could find one among hundreds of hairdressers. But that was not the case until David Todd came here from California over 10 years ago. I was one of his first clients and can attest that he is, by far, the best hair colorist you can find.  Not only does he understand hair and color, he uses the best products that do not fade. If you try him once, you would never go anywhere else! \n\nDave coloring and Frank cutting is an unbeatable combination.\n\nAnd, if that is not enough, they have the best personalities and make you feel welcome and at home!
3;Excellent food for such a small place.  Fresh tortillas made here daily.  Outstanding
2;"What happened? \n\nOn a much delayed return visit, I found Barioja to be sorely wanting in comparison to my last visit. We came in with a Groupon. My mother had been dying to try the gambas once more, the last time was a delicious memory of giant grilled prawns - this time, very much shrunken versions of the same dish. Patatas aioli - blatantly reheated and somewhat tasteless. I felt the menu had shrunk as well, and the options on offer much more limited than before. \n\nFinally, service was seriously lacklustre. The voucher we had was for 5 dishes and 2 glasses of wine - when we got the bill, turned out we were charged for two glasses out of the 6 we were due as part of the offer. It took a long time to resolve, and a lot of patience to explain that 4+2 really did equal six. It will take me some time to be persuaded to return - disappointing food that grew more and more disappointing as we ate; and even more disappointing service. Perhaps touched with a bit of the groupons; but it's sign enough that I can put money in other restaurants, elsewhere."
4;Legitimate Szechuan and Cantonese recipes executed with excellence in generous portions, all at a fair price.\n\nI have been here twice since my check-in and I will say this place epitomizes the old saying: Don't Judge a book by it's cover. The location, exterior and even interior to some extent are less then impressive, though the quality of food that comes out of the kitchen is exquisite. This place has been burned into my mind as a personal favorite.\n\nThings I have tried so far (as close as I can remember):\n1. 'War Wonton' soup\n2. Beef tripe/Pork noodle soup\n3. Mushroom and bacon plate\n\nAll incredible.
1;After 9 on a Monday night, even during The Festival, is probably not the time to see this place at its best but then on the otherhand its hardly likely to be high class dining at the best of times, as I've yet to experience one of its kind that's more than functional.\n\n\n A good and wide selection of starters, main courses & desserts seem to be available although at the time of night I visited they're understandably not all replenished continuously. A small selection of sushi was also evident although neither myself or my companion sampled this.\n\n\n All in all then on a par with Jimmy Chung's & the others of its ilk - a means to an end.
1;The chicken coconut soup was okay .. it was really smooth but I felt like it tasted kind of weird . I liked the thing that it came in though .. it looks really nice and fancy . The pad see ew was below average . It wasn't all that tasty and the beef was hard to chew . The thai iced tea wasn't that great either .
2;The hibachi was pretty good. The sushi was pretty good too. Not anything amazing, but it's fun for a group of people. The wait staff was very friendly.
1;I don't know why so many people are raving about the food at Dos Reales. My roommate are crazy about this place! I think the food is just ordinary. For some reason, their food tastes the same to me, whether it's chimichanga, burritos, or tacos. I had their temales and they were overly cheesy to a point where it felt gross eating it. Yuck!
2;"OK so I did go back. So sue me. My friend wanted to go and we live close. This time however they had a young man at the counter. The owners should never, ever be at the counter again. This young man was a pleasure and a professional. He was attentive and friendly. They should pay him for all the lost customers they themselves have lost and he brings back. This time the cupcakes were great. My only problem is I have never gotten one cupcake home that's not totally decapitated by the terrible boxes. The cupcakes can not go 1 mile without falling over and that is disappointing when you get home. Also, a place to sit would be nice. Note to the owners: we don\""t want to sit for an hour, but it would be nice to enjoy the cupcake for 10-15 minutes.  This is a reason I never go to sprinkles. Just one or two seats would be nice."
0;Breaking News, : When you book through Expedia you DON'T get points w/ JW.  This is just dumb,  how forward thinking of this company.  This is not professional and I will never stay at a Marriott again,  and I am an elite level Marriott Rewards cloent.  Hmm.  All this so they can save the 5 bucks they have to pay Expedia for their service.
2;We went around lunch time on a Saturday, but I didn't think this buffet was all that great.  There was nothing wrong with the food, but there was also nothing spectacular.  I far prefer the Rio which has multiple international stations and a ton of desserts.  I'm not sure this buffet would be worth the long line
4;This place is great! Looking forward to watching d games here. Just tried d wings n thought I was in Buffalo. Good job guys. I'll definitely b back!
2;My girlfriend and I came here ate breakfast here four times (guests at the hotel) and a late lunch one time.\n\nThe breakfast was standard, nothing special. Mozen serves traditional breakfast items and nothing was that unique or creative besides a Japanese breakfast bento box, which was the best thing I ordered over four days. Everything else was just okay. \n\nLunch was also okay. \n\nThe prices are very expensive for the quality of food. This place certainly beats going to a buffet though.
3;A regular stop when I am hosting a big dinner or want to offer a variety of cheese to my guests. Very interesting selection, friendly service, and great cheese. It's a small shop so it can get crowded.
3;Saigon Siagon, so good they named it twice.\n\nThis place know how to make chinese food, you actually come away feeling that they put some effort into the food instead of the usual China Buffets that we're used too.\n\nIt doesn't tase greasy, it's not overcooked and you can actually taste flavour, whats the catch?\n\nThe waitress kept approaching me while I was eating offering to refill my drinks, I don't know if she was being overcurtious but I felt really rushed to finish what was a great Veg Chow mein. I'm gonna give her the benifit of the doubt though.
3;"Friday night we two arrived without reservation.  Hostess showed us to table in back of restaurant.  Noticed empty booth and asked if we could sit there.  Walked back to hostess at front and advised yes we could, then shown to booth.  Weak start to a good meal.  Restaurant noisy though not full.  Once seated water promptly brought but without requested lemon.  Lemon brought in wedges on plate at second request.  OK bread with two spreads.  Server and assistant introduced themselves, though runners brought food.  All friendly but never certain who was serving us.\n\nStarted with excellent wedge salad.  Asked to shared and brought on two plates.  Good blue cheese dressing and crisp lettuce.  My entree was a huge, delicious pork chop, cooked perfect medium.  Great flavor and taste.  Companions petite 6 oz filet cooked to requested rare plus but a tad over seasoned.  Served with small amount of good potatoes with cheese.  Separate order of outstanding onion rings; ample serving.  Asparagus were grilled and would have preferred steam as flavor lacking.  Table well manicured and servers attentive.  Service fine but flawed.  Steaks and chops are what one goes to Flemings for and they are great."
4;Consistently the best Mexican food in Vegas in a gorgeous restaurant!  The beef enchiladas with red sauce are my favorite and a must try.  Great prices, fun atmosphere and good service.......consistently!
0;Horrible drive thru! I waited 10 mins after i paid before they told me the fryer was not on and they were unable to service me.
4;"This place is dangerous... in a good way lol  Bad for your waistline and wallet, but so so yummy.  I stayed in an Aria suite and stopped at Jean Philippe each night I was there (4) and once in the morning for a chocolate crepe before I left for the airport.  Each dessert is around $6.50, which sounds reasonable except for the fact that you'll want to try all of them!!  My favorite turned out to be the cheesecake with the raspberry on top- It's described as \""cream cheese, graham cracker, and raspberry compote.\""  I just call it nummy goodness.  It's bascially a small moist graham cracker disc topped with a sweet cream cheese which is then topped with this sweet raspberry mixture and encased in what I remember was flexible white chocolate.  I mean, it's so smooth and delicious you're bound to get addicted.  Don't miss it!  Expect to spend at least $40 over the course of your Vegas trips due to repeat visits =)  Also, there's one in Aria and also one in Bellagio.  The one in Bellagio has the cool chocolate fountain.  Aria has the bigger Jean Philippe, yet Bellagio has the chocolate fountain... So, I'd say visit both! lol"
0;Somewhere between the movie Beetlejuice and the crap flung around a crack whore's apartment lies Curiouser and Curiouser - the retail incarnation of schizophrenia. \n\nAvoid this dump and its insane owner like the plague.
1;I stopped in Mattie's on a Sunday morning in search of a cure for my hangover.  I've always been intrigued by this little place, and do I mean little.  I walked in and was surprised how small and quaint it was.  Apparently they brought this diner all the way down here from New Jersey, pretty cool.  It was a fun atmospere, but I cannot even imagine the craziness on a Fri/Sat or after a show.\n\nThe food was pretty mediocre in my opinion.  I got the 'Junkyard' which is essentially a big breakfast bowl with chili.  The chili was soupy and mild, but I like mine to be thick and spicy.  The cheese wasn't melted on top either.  I can't stand when I get something covered in cheese and it's not melted (the food wasn't exactly piping hot...).  I expected ground sausage to be mixed in, but it was just 2 sausage patties thrown on top.  I can make a breakfast bowl 10x better at my house.\n\nI'll probably try it again late night after a show.  I'm betting I'll enjoy it more.
0;Stopped in to pick up 2 blizzards which were served to us like soupy ice cream. The customer service was terrible and they had about 5 employees working in the front all of which were focused on the drive thru. Terrible service... If you really want DQ go to a different location.
1;"There's something about Biblos that was telling me \""do not come here. You won't really like it\"". I should really listen to my intuition.\n\nNow, it's not awful per se. It's big, there's lots of seats, there are drinks and \""cocktails\"" (really not worth it though), the staff are friendly, the crowd is alright.\n\nBut it's just so soulless. You know that cut scene in Chicago where Catherine Zeta Jones' character sings a song about Class, and how no one has it any more. It's all sell-outs and cheap frocks and cheaper drinks. That's what Biblos is lacking. Class. Call me a snob, or a fussy drinker. I am. I like my margartia to have proper salt on the rim of a proper glass, and not to be watered down with too much tap-water ice. I like my caipirinha to have plenty of lime, properly battered at the bottom of the glass, with just the right amount of brown sugar and nice cachaca. Not a mixture of what tasted like off-rum and more tap water.\n\nOk so I drink cocktails and the cocktails here aren't good. If you were looking for a beer, a g&t and a place to sit it's ok. But I've also tried the food here and it was quite uninspiring. Not awful, hence not 1 star. But very bland and standard pub fare. Basically, for the price you're paying (\u00a38 - \u00a310 for a main) you'd be better going to a million other bars or restaurants or caf\u00e9s that do food at exactly the same price, or cheaper, at far better quality. If it was \u00a33 for the chicken breast I had, then it's evidently at least good value. But I was paying the same I would pay at one of my favourite bars for a hand-made burger, thick sweet potato wedges on a soft sourdough bun. It doesn't add up.\n\nIt's really central, and was right round the corner from our NYE venue so it made do. And I wasn't disappointed. I just didn't feel anything for it at all really."
0;I was so disappointed in the service I received / didn't receive that I have taken the time to add this business to the Yelp directory.  \nI was suckered into the 'for just $10 more' deal (hand wash - top of the line cleaning inside and out)  and was completely disappointed.  I could have done a better job washing my car myself.  The worst part - I told them I only had a 1/2 hour to be there - at 45 minutes I just said 'screw it' - I'll miss yoga - things could be worse.  Finally after an hour and a half - I have to track down my car.  When I finally do get to my car - it needs to be re-vacuumed - the inside was not wiped down and overall I did not get very much return on my investment.  I spoke to the manager and expressed that if my expectations were too high to please let me know - I really didn't want to be a b*tch - but after 90 minutes and $30 - I figured I deserve a clean car.  So the long and the short of it is - if you want a half a** job - this is the place to go.
1;This was our third time dining at the Eiffel Tower Restaurant, and the food was wonderful as always.  The view is spectacular, especially if you have a window seat as we have all three times. Our waiter was very nice and quite helpful with menu suggestions.  The evening would have been wonderful once again except that as the server was clearing our dinner plates he unfortunately spilled what was left of my wife's glass of wine on her dress.  He was very nice helping clean things up and explained to our waiter what had happened, but did nothing more than fill her glass with what was left in the bottle. When you pay $400 for a dinner, you would expect at least a replacement pour or a complimentary dessert, but we were offered nothing.
3;Overall, I recommend. The pulled chicken and it was a little dry so I use extra BBQ sauce to bring freshness to it. BBQ food tends to be greasy so keep that in mind.
1;"I can' t figure this place out...It's authentic Mexican but with Eminem playing in the background, and a gas station decor. Nothing meshes with one another.\n\nMy sister and I came in last week for our first visit and they were pretty slow at around 1:30 not typical for this area during the week we had anticipated a wait... we were wrong! Sat right away but when walking in you can hear the servers \""arguing\"" over who was going to take our table because they wanted to go home...Not an all that welcome feel and not a great impression of how our meal was going to go.\n\nWe ordered the Guacamole to start along with the chips and salsa they already give you (which were really good) the Guacamole wasn't my favorite (not made to order) i kept adding salt to mine because my sister liked it the way it was I found it extremely weird that we were never given plates to share these things so i kept making a mess everywhere Oopsy! I had the Shrimp Taco's grilled not fried and I liked everything inside but could've done without the Corn Tortillas they had a very rubbery feel and taste to them. the rice and Re-fried beans were tasty also. My sister had the Salad with some white fish on it I was thinking Mahi not sure though she said it was ok. \n\nOur server wasn't one for the small details like the lack of plates and the lack of refills of our water and tea. He did however knock out a bunch of his side work so he could get out of there! While eating our lunch the 2 servers working insisted on having a conversation about they're dislike for someone they work with and were even dropping the F-Bomb right behind our table and next to us at one point. I did see a gentleman at the bar eating that I do believe was the manager so obviously with that type of leadership the rest of staff will do what they want. I get it you all want to go home/eat your lunch but when you still have customers aren't you suppose to put all of that on hold or even just do it out of plain sight so we don't feel rushed..."
0;"If you are disabled--Flemings is NOT the place for you!!!  My friend who is battling cancer of the mouth --made a terrible choice to dine there at happy hour last night.  After waiting for almost 2 hours for a table--No complaint there--we ordered our food and another glass of wine.  We were informed I could have another glass of wine--but my friend could no longer be served.  We ask to speak to the manager. When I questioned if it was due to how she spoke--she sounds like a deaf person--as she has a HUGE hole in the roof of her mouth--and she is battling Cancer of the mouth  --The manager became defensive and wouldn't even listen. This was the first night my friend had gone out since the beginning of Dec, as she is sensitive to the way she sounds.  It was the most horrific and embarrassing events I have been involved with.  She did valet her car--and they had no issue having her drive away:)---and she got an email this am--Thanking her for her business last night and they can't wait to  raise there glass to her again soon!!  REALLY--Flemings....you should be ashamed of yourselves!!!!  You need to do some ADA training, Customer Service Training, Listening skills training and Diversity Training.  I will NEVER EVER step foot in any of your restaurants again--and I pray that  no one else with  a Speech issues, or any type of challenge outside of the \""normal\"" chooses to dine with you--as you clearly don't know how to treat people with Special needs."
4;Love this place. Classy yet sports everywhere!
2;"Have eaten here probably 4 5x now and it is really one of my fave restaurants for a night out on the Strip... \n\nSo... why 3 stars only this time???  I'm gonna throw the reservation peeps under the bus here... Early last week I called the direct restaurant line (not the general MGM dining reservation line) to speak with someone at the restaurant to reserve a special table (one of the cool \""penninsula\"" tables right by the kitchen) for a special birthday celebration on the subsequent Friday. \n\nI called at an off hours to ensure that I could explain to the person that I really wanted this particular table blah blah.  To make a long story short, I explained everything and was assured that that table was booked for me at 7:30 that Friday, and received my confirmation code and was so excited for the special birthday meal to come... \n\nWell, Io and behold we arrived at the designated time that Friday all ready to celebrate and they had screwed up the reservation (had booked us instead at 6pm) so of course, no available kitchen-view table for us :(\n\nSigh... So our special evening was celebrated at at tiny table w/ no view of anything at the way back of the restaurant.  The saving grace was absolutely *excellent* service by our super-friendly waitperson (Ernest) and the always amazing food ~ esp. the anchovies on toast, the white ceviche and and a drop-dead delicious mushroom risotto.\n\nMoral of the story: CONFIRM your reservation the day before to ensure that it has not been screwed up, especially if it is a special occasion evening."
2;"Two words you must remember. Pistachio baklava. This dessert is done well here! There is also walnut, but only tried the pistachio one.\n\nThe combo appetizer plate was adorned with hummus, baba ghanouj (blended eggplant with spices, garlic, and olive oil), falafel, and dolmas (rice parsley, dill, and more all wrapped in grape leaves). I am already a fan of baba ghanouj and hummus, but dolmas are interesting to me because of the unique textures and contrasting flavors all wrapped in grape leaves. I keep ordering dolmas to see which one I like best, and so far I'm a fan of the dolmas here too.\n\nThe beef souvlaki and chicken souvlaki are full of flavor. However, the beef souvlaki was cooked \""well done\"" even though we ordered it \""medium rare.\"" The souvlaki was a bit drier than I'd like but I enjoyed it here better than some other Greek places I've had on the west side. \n\nThe restaurant itself is bright inside. The menu is very clear and easy to read when you order at the counter. Once you order, you can seat yourself anywhere and kick back and watch tv (like the BCS championship game for instance, which was playing when I walked in tonight to pick up food to go). \n\nCall me biased based on convenience, but I am just so happy to have Greek food this close to me, so I'd give this place 3.5 stars if I could for that alone! (Even if my sole purpose was to get baklava only to go)."
1;Waaaay over rated.Getting 2 stars ONLY cause I have friends that work there & local support...somewhat.\n It used to be sooo good in the 90's..I guess everything was though. lol \nBartenders think their shit don't stink. (and I'm a Bartender, so I have extra patience) SERVICE STINKS!\n At least the Security Guards are NOT DICKS! (which is usually the opposite). I gave this place several chances because of the bands that play there deserve support. IF Advising visitors to pass! TOO many other REAL LOCAL HANG OUTS, within walking distance too.
4;Best Hawaiian restaurant in Las Vegas. Hands down.
2;Pricey for the quality of food. Steak was decent... But not $60 quality. Fancy atmosphere is strange combo of sports bar and high end steakhouse. Service was good. Hostess was snooty.
0;Worthless.  Everyone in the television department sits around talking to each other.  You basically have to tape $20 bills to your forehead in order to get any attention.  Based on how empty sections of the store are, they must be going out of business.  The furniture department is stocked with things to look at, but rarely is it in stock.  Big profits in furniture....I wouldn't be surprised if they turn into a furniture store.
3;Stopped by for dinner before seeing Penn & Teller at the Rio last week. It was my first visit to this location, so I was surprised to see such a small one in a food court. Great sandwiches as usual, though. Can't go wrong with their Ham & Swiss.
4;What a night at Hakkasan Bachelor, Bachelorette, and dirty 30 BDay all in one.We got one of the best table service so far here at Hakkasan. They really improved on that.  I mean that our drinks was never empty. Our server Megan did an amazing job of filling everybody drinks, and always refilling our drink mixes also mixing drinks. This was one of the craziest night ever. Tiesto threw down an amazing set over 2 hours. Everybody in our party had a really great time, and that's all I can remember.
2;Dinner was Good but wasn't as great as expected. However breakfast/lunch is a lot better! Free drinks ( soft drinks, juices, coffee and tea) and $12 unlimited alcohol package available. Staff is very rude and unorganised however waiters are friendly but very few, so do mind then running around past you a lot trying to do a 5 man job on their own.
2;I'm not a big golf fan, but all my friends are. Tried to play for like the 5th or 6th time. Still don't like it. But with that said. The course is nice. We went after 4pm so for a round it was only $16. That's great in my book since I didn't want to spend alot for a sport I can't really get into. But be prepared there is a 4pm rush so it might be pretty busy. The course is in between houses and apartments so watch out if you aren't very good. Nice course, very well maintained, and cheap prices after 4pm. As for my golfing days....they are prob over.
2;The people are very helpful prices are very high Maricopa needs a Home Depot or a second choice for a store
4;I'm all about different experiences! Halloween all year long. I would for sure bring my kids here, they'll have a good time with the ambiance. Coming back for sure for Halloween for the haunted house. Theres also a bar and good food with cool names like child of the corn. I loved the child of the corn which was battered corn balls fried, yum! The salad was amazing along with the burger!! yummy will be back oct or for their themed parties over the weekend.
3;Best American inspired cakes in Phoenix. High quality. Good Deserts. Had a very good red velvet cake from here.\n\nSome of the sweets are too sweet. For example, the macaroon is way sweeter than what I consider good.\n\nIf you need something that's good and unique in Phx, I'd recommend this place.
2;I really enjoyed this place! I know that my 3 stars seem meager for that statement but hear me out....\n\nI loved the food, I got the Chicken Sandwich (GREAT pesto) with a side of fries. Everything was delicious :) I would have liked to see better pricing though. It was a little expensive for lunch. We didnt even have drinks and we wracked up a $30 lunch bill with two entrees. \n\nI will DEFINITELY be going back, and I recommend the food! However, I would like to be wow'd a little more (for the price I paid) before I dole out any extra stars. \n\nGreat atmosphere, yummy food....just missing a little SOMETHING to justify the extra pennies :)
3;I like this place! They pour pretty strong drinks, and they always have a delicious variety on their menu. It gets a little too loud on nights when they have a DJ, but it's still fun. It's a nice place to go for a drink date or something.
3;Bring a jacket if you intend on studying here. This place is an icebox even during the summer.
1;"It was a fair \""regular\"" burger for $12, ordered it medium-rare, came out rare.  Value just not there, $50 for 2 burgers, 1 salad, and 1 pint of beer... you're playing for location in a somewhat loud, minor-league hip, over-hyped sportsbar.  I should have just gone to the buffet... I miss the old school Vegas coffee shop."
3;Diesel has the best music on Southside. DJ's that can tear it up and shows on certain weeks.  My favorite dance club in Pittsburgh. Word. that being said, the covers are expensive, the drinks are ridiculously over priced and the crowd has a tendency to be 1. creepy business men trying to get theirs or 2. wasted college girls who get in for free because they look bangin'.  If you go with some friends, it's a great time.  We usually bitch about the cover and (when I'm with some pretty ladies) can get in without the cover, but you may want to start a cheaper bar to avoid the $5 Yuengling bottles.
3;I really liked this place, and haven't had anything quite like it. \n\nWhen my colleague first suggested it - a place that combined Chinese & Mexican - I was intrigued. Then he mentioned it was featured on the Food network. Sure, I was in. \n\nSince I had no expectations going in (how could I possibly expect anything? I had no idea how you could combine these two cuisines), I was quite pleased with the result. I got the Jade Red chicken and the Pollo Diablo, and loved both!
3;"Every crave something you just cannot get it out of your head?   It's pop corn for me, the kind you get at the movies with all that butter and added flavors like white Cheddar cheese.\n\nWe decided to give Popped a try and walked in to to a small, quaint place with two bubbly ladies working behind the counter.  One was busy talking with a few Asian fellows, perhaps tourists, and she was demonstrating the frozen popcorn to them.\n\nMy husband and I tried the sample they offered, which was the raspberry chocolate.  It was good, but didn't have intense flavor I thought it would. \n\nWe ended up getting a savory \""chock you jalapeno\"".  The portion size was just right and the flavor wasn't too  spicy hot.  I would like to go back for sure."
4;I love Summer Massoud! She is so warm and welcoming. She made sure I knew all I could about taking care of my skin and gave great advice. She loves to share her wealth of knowledge about skin care so everyone can look beautiful! My skin was AMAZING after my facial and looked even better this morning! Such a great experience, I can't wait for my next one!
4;These guys are great! I've been taking all my vehicles here for years. Numerous times I've gone in there expecting the worse, only to find out the repair was not as bad as I had feared. \n\nMonti, Bob, Cory, Frank and everyone else at the shop are guys you can trust. They won't try to sell you repairs you don't need and even better will refer you to a different shop if it's outside their scope which is soooooo much better than trying to charge you for a fix that doesn't work.\n\nIn the rare case issues arise with the repair they always stand by their warranty and make things right no questions asked. \n\nHighly recommend!
4;We just had the best Saturday morning breakfast prepared by Donna.  Our expectations were exceeded from beginning to end.  Food was wonderful and the service was amazing.  We even received a text later in the day asking how our experience was.  What a great start to our Saturday.  Curt Henderson
2;"I have been to Suite on quite a few occasions and on different nights of the week to get a feel of the crowds, the service, and the atmosphere.\n\nService - Most of them are pretty courteous.  The pace behind the bar is very fast since there are so many people crowding the bar at once, so make sure you know what you want before the Bartender gets to you.  You may only have a few seconds to decide before you're skipped over.  To get the best service, get yourself some cash and go to the Red Bull kiosks on the outdoor patio (cash only).\n\nPrice - The $9 cover is steep and an odd number to charge, IMO.  This place is about on par with Forum and HOM as far as price is concerned.  Do not ask about specials, the only specials they have are \""Full Price Drinks All Night.\""\n\nAtmosphere - Everyone dresses up to come to this place, so come dressed to impress every night.  The lights are low, the DJs are usually pretty good, and the sound system is just right.  The outdoor area is the most laid back.  Come out here if you don't want to dance and if you want to mingle amongst the crowd and hold a conversation.  The crowd can be a little pretentious on some nights.\n\nOverall - I'd say that Suite is a place you will either love or you will hate.  I think it's a good place to start the night, but not necessarily a good place to end the night.  The lines get ridiculously long as the night progresses so get there early if you want to get in before 1:30 AM."
0;Worst Theater ever - avoid at all costs. \nWell, if you can tolerate the smell, sticky floors, etc., it's actually 50 cents cheaper for students.
2;Where is a girl suppose to buy alcohol around here? \n\nMe and some friends wanted to pre-game in our suite before clubbin, so we wanted to buy a bottle of Belvedere. But we didn't want to walk far so we found this place downstairs of our hotel. Now the prices here are of course jacked up because it is on the strip and in a nice hotel. Most places that sell alcohol on the strip, sell if for more than it's usual retail price. Unfortunately they didn't have Belvedere so we settled for the next best thing, grey goose. Anyways, a bottle of goose was almost $85, you can get it at a grocery market for like 40 something. Six bottles small bottles of cranberry juice and one bag of chips came out to be almost $30. \n\nBut, hey it was all so we could have fun, so it didn't matter! Thank god for this place being right downstairs because if you ordered a bottle from room service, that bad boy would cost you $150!
4;We recently moved and had Jeff re-key the whole house. He not only did an excellent job with that. but also adivsed us on some changes to the lock setup that made a lot of sense and will add to the home's security. We really appreciate his professionalism and high quality service. I highly recommend Jeff to anyone needing quality locksmith work.
3;We came to Lagasse Stadium since we were staying at the Palazzo and it was obviously very convenient.  We had some time to kill before we caught a cab to the airport so we stopped in for lunch.  My boyfriend and I both ordered the burgers which we loaded with cheese and bacon.  The French fries were super good and the burgers were really big and tasted amazing.  The place is really cool especially if you're there to watch a game and/or place some bets.  There are a ton of TV's and cool places to sit and relax.  I would definitely come back here for a game, some good bar food and a time-out from the casino.
4;My all-time favorite.  Superb!
0;Terrible... Tasted like bad frozen food and only made my stomach toss and turn the rest of the night. Will never order here again.
4;Delicious food, friendly staff and is a nice clean environment. Oh and the waiters cute. Will definitely be coming back.
4;Hands down, the best date place in central Phoenix. \n\nSadly, I was apparently not on a date and ended up having to pay for our bill BUT in retrospect I was still so damn impressed by this place.\n\nRumor has it that this place is owned by several male flight attendants and when they're not attending flights they are running this restaurant. Leave it to world travelers to produce a classy but quaint but sosticated but understated establishment that can truly please everyone. In true Phoenix fashion, Coronado Cafe was once a house and now stands as a Bistro Cafe. The front porch is now patio seating with cute little tables and bench style sitting all under canopy drapes and string lights. On the inside is the cutest little bar area, very small, but the older gentlemen running the place is so cute and you can tell he really know is cocktails and puts passion into crafting each one. There's also a secluded side patio that's ADORABLE.\n\nWe ate inside the dining room because the rain (rain, I know... in Phoenix?) started coming down and the wait staff was so attentive and helped us relocate. We were sat in the corner by a window that had its own little garden bed outside. Could not get over this palces cute factor. Tables were small but candle lit and had the presh checker print table clothes, real napkins and honestly one of the best waitresses I've ever had. \n\nWe order 2 Tequilatinis on Happy Hour and the artichoke dip. This artichoke dip opened the gates of heaven and brought to us the most delightful, out of the ordinary, festive taste I have ever had. It was spicy, but cheesy. It was melty but had good size chunks of artichoke. Simply, cannot go on enough about how good it was.\n\nI cannot wait to go back here and have brunch or enjoy the sunset with drinks on the patio. If you're looking for somewhere small and intimate that you'd like to take a significant other or truly impress someone you care about, pelase go here. Everything is perfect for the perfect date.
4;"I have eaten at BBQ King for over 10 years. They are the best! My Favorite is the BBQ Plate. I substitute Onion Rings for the French Fries that normally come on the plate. The rings are always good and crispy, the bbq \""melt in your mouth\"" tender and the hush puppies AND the coleslaw are the best around, hands down. I have made a lunch of JUST the coleslaw and a half dozen pups before!\nTheir tea is great and the Cherry Lemon Sundrop is made the old fashion way with syrup and a cherry!\nI like the the hamburger steak, the ribeye sandwich and the PO Boy. \nYou can't beat the people that work at the BBQ King. It's a family business and you get the feeling you are part of the family!\nIf you get a plate, come hungry!"
2;Food was pretty good, not fantastic.  Music was so loud that a normal conversational tone was not sufficient. Not sure if I'd recommend it, not bad...not great. Go next door and get a pizza.
0;Stopped here for a cheap takeout lunch thinking it'd be just as good as their cheap breakfast. I ordered the hot hamburger with mashed potatoes for $5.95. They ended up running out of mashed potatoes and replaced it with a measly salad (they failed to tell me this was extra while leaving me thinking it was complementary). \n\nThe burger patty came without a bun, and sat on a single slice of bread drenched in gravy while the measly salad sat in a corner of the styrofoam takeout box. \n\nI expected more for $8. I'll be avoiding Slices in the future...
4;I come by here every weekend day when I walk my dog. Friendly faces and baristas that know what they are doing. In the summer, the iced coffees are great, but I am a sucker for a great latt\u00e9 and I have never left here disappointed. Am more than happy to help out a local, hole in the wall place versus the Goliath Starbucks down the street.
4;I had sworn off Red Robin because of the horrible service that we received twice in Centennial Hills, Las Vegas. I like the food, but I refuse to eat somewhere with bad service. When the new one in Downtown Summerlin opened, I figured we'd give it a shot. The service was incredible and the staff was extremely pleasant, friendly and fast. When a part of my order was accidentally missed, it was corrected immediately and with many apologies. I would highly recommend this location.
0;"On September 10th, I went to Bank of America at 6900 Westcliff Dr. The line was very, very long with only 2 bank tellers. I asked for the signature card to my Safe Deposit Box to add a name to it. It turns out the bank couldn't find it. After 20 minutes of looking they ask me to come back tomorrow with an appointment.\n\nOn September 11th, I went back to the bank at 3:00 for my appointment with Ms. Susan Mowatt. She was very nice in helping me. But unfortunately she still couldn't find my signature card. She found my son's safe Deposit signature card, but couldn't find mine. I explained that this was the SECOND TIME they lost my signature card. It's like losing my passport. I was very concerned. Then, from another desk came the manager, Ms Carina Mettlin, who was there the first day, held a grudge against me because the previous day I came in \""too late.\"" But if I came in when they were closing, why wouldn't they just tell me it's too late? I got there at 4:45pm. Didn't think it was a problem.\n\nShe was telling me that they were NOT supposed to help anyone after 4:30 (Like they were doing me a favor!) I said I am concerned that this bank lost my signature card for the second time. Ms Carina Mettlin started raising her voice to me, which I thought was very unprofessional. She said \""We didn't lose your signature card, we 'misplaced it,' and it will take 48 hours for us to try to find it.\"" Doesn't 'misplacing' something mean that they lost it? She then accused me of raising my voice and said \""I'm DONE WITH YOU,\"" like she was dismissing me. Like a school teacher. As I was walking out, I decided to ask for a manager. She refused, and just gave me information to email higher management. I found this infuriating and am very disappointed in this whole situation. Last thing she said to me in a condescending way, was \""HAVE A NICE DAY.\""\n\nDon't go to this bank if you need good, reliable service. And try to avoid Ms. Carina Mettlin."
0;Hmmm....got to front door walked in nobody waiting. Handed a beeper...yes doesn't everyone hand you a beeper when its empty? Sat down and another couple comes in....another beeper handed out. Smartly after a few minutes they returned the beeper and left. Another 3 minutes I walk up lay the beeper down and announce were leaving. As were leaving the two girls chit chatting while we waited to be seated in the empty restaurant giggled with a customer as we left. Called manager 20 minutes later fuming at being treated so poorly...guess what...they were unavailable. ...not there on a Saturday night at 5 pm? Sad part is we've been there before and its been good. We will NEVER return. I will however contact the owner. Sad folks don't care when money walks out the door...
3;"Love this place, so much fun! This is mostly an outside bar, but there is an inside if you don't want to sit in \""AZ Cold\"" weather lol! They have the heating vents placed all around the outside, lights hanging, music playing, chairs, tables, couches and of course, it is decorated for Christmas...... lots of fun! The Perch has its own brewery in the back, so if you like different beers, this place is a good place to try! Their food selection is OK, not fantastic, but decent. I like to go more for the atmosphere, enjoy the nice weather, listen to live music and catch up with friends! This place is very random and different, one of the main reasons I like it so much! Its also right in down town chandler, so if you like Christmas light looking, you can check that out down town after you're done enjoying this place! Have fun!!!"
4;One of the best Thai restaurants I've been. We were seated right away on a Saturday evening, and the service was fast, accurate, and very friendly. \nWe ordered pad kee mow - amazing! And also the country curry. I would recommend the pad kee mow because the portion is quite big. Mild spicy doesn't taste spicy at all. The country curry wasn't that impressive, unfortunately. It is water based, so it doesn't taste like the traditional coconut based curry. \nThe dessert was fantastic. We ordered coconut ice cream with sticky rice. Wow! It was so big and delicious! Definitely do it if you like coconut. \nWill come again next time we are in Vegas!
2;Oakland has some good restaurants/places to eat, but I never knew about Pizza Sola until we went there after the semi-formal last Friday.  I watched them eat that night (lol a dieting monster cannot eat at night, sadly), but the Sheep and I went to eat it the next day.  It was last meal of him being a sheep.\n\nAnyway, I think the allure of this place is that its NY-style pizza.  I've heard that NY pizza is really really good, and we did try it once during my freshman year Thanksgiving break, but I was so starved by then I probably would have thought OE was amazing food.  In general, I'm not a big fan of pizza (mostly because its crazy fattening) but we went anyway.\n\nI wanted mushroom pizza (because I saw Julie order it the night before) but they didn't have any, so they gave me a cheese pizza with mushrooms added.  The Sheep ordered pepperoni, of course.\n\nSo large that it doesn't fit on one plate!\n\nThe pizzas were so big that they were bigger than my face.  I swear to god they were.  I guess I liked it.  Actually, I'm not sure what the difference between good pizza and bad pizza.  I would have preferred the cheese to be meltier, but the crust as thin and light, not chewy as a rubber band.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing.  I probably wouldn't go again, but that's just me not liking pizza.
1;"Good: moderate price. Great modern rooms and decorations. Great restaurants.\n\nBad: service, service, service, even months after grand opening.\n1.Had to stand for 45 minutes in line to register and get the key. They obviously have never heard of the \""queuing theory\"" for a problem that is so easily solvable .\n2. They rudely told me that I cannot checkout at 12 instead of 11. Every other hotel I have stayed in, allow that.\n3. Their tv-based checkout did not allow checkout. Error message.  \n4. Called to checkout and was on hold for so long, I left the room in frustration \n5. Checkout counter had no sign. Stayed in the wrong line to checkout and after 25 min they told me to go the last line. I asked them why no sign this line is for checkout and they just said they r sorry but no explanation!\n6. Another damn 30 minutes in right line to checkout....\n7. Staff at regular area like robots! They can only recite what they were taught and could not for a second be creative.\n8. $28 mandatory resort fee but the pool was closed due to whatever reason. I gave up!\nReally? To go through all these just to checkout! I mean u spent hundreds of millions to renovate this place but can't have a simple system in place!\n\nBut if they solve their service issues, a very nice hotel! Feels like the best of them in terms of that Hollywood  feel..."
4;I bought a boxed tuna salad from this place. When I got to my terminal and tasted it, I was stunned. This was the best airport food I've ever experienced, so good that I wish I had also bought coffee there when I had the chance. Also so good that I have visited their yelp page a few times just to read reviews and reminisce, even though this place is in Phoenix, and I live in L.A.  I even created a yelp account so I could share the love.
1;This place in my opinion is nothing special. My wife and I live right around the corner from here, so we though we would give it a try and really hoped we would like it. We got chicken curry and chicken pad Thai. Both were pretty bland. Neither my wife and I were too pumped about our food. I probably won't come back here.
0;I tried and I tried and I tried to order pizza from these guys.  We had agreed on an order and at that moment I had a call come in THAT I HAD TO take.  I asked the lady to hold for 30 seconds and she hung up immediately.  I called back to complete the order the the guy asked me for my credit card number 8 times and still said he did not get it.  He went on about their computer system this and the computer system that.\n\nAfter I give my credit card number 8 times I give up.
2;It doesn't pretend to be actual mexican food, but it is good for what it is. Big meals, cheap, served fast. I enjoyed the huge number of vegetarian options - practically everything on the menu can be made meatless if that's how you're rolling. I had tofu in my burrito, which turned out too mild compared to the loud flavors it was paired with. But filled me up, and I love any place the serves chick peas. (I know, I know. I just love them.) I tried some of the corn bread, and will say if you've never had real cornbread you'll like it. It tastes good, because its actually cake.
3;Located at the west end of the Town Square shopping complex, the Rave Motion Pictures Town Square 18 (what a mouthful!) is easily the best multiplex in the city, with state-of-the-art projection & sound and comfortable stadium-style tiered seating.\n\nMy only minor quibble would be the difficulty of its entrance. The Town Square shopping complex is an open-air mall, so you have to enter it from ground-level, but the Rave Motion Pictures Town Square 18 is on the second floor, necessitating a long climb up some steep stairs. There are escalators and an elevator nearby, though. I've just had some problems with companions who are not comfortable scaling all those steps, especially when they're wet.\n\nBut the theater itself is top-notch, especially compared to others in Las Vegas. I love the fact you can purchase tickets from a kiosk without having to wait in line to transact with a live cashier, and I also like the fact that the main exits deposit you right next to the entrance. Other local theaters either force you to use the same doors as entering patrons, or they lead you to some disorienting new place that's not close to where you entered.\n\nConcessions are about what you'd expect, and I'm always surprised how easy it is to upsize your beverage to a truly unwieldy amount that will send you to the restrooms mid-movie.\n\nIn all, the Rave Motion Pictures Town Square 18 is the best place to view movies in all of Las Vegas.
1;Serves up some pretty typical pub food. Bland is as good a description for the food as it gets. The onion rings are bland, the burgers are bland, the bbq is bland, the fries are bland.... you get the idea. Nice patio, drink prices are ok. Service is so so.
1;Ordered soup and shrimp spring rolls. Told them two separate times no pig blood in my soup. I get home to find it's full of pork blood. I ended up throwing the soup out because they were closed by the time I got to the soup, waste of money. If you look at the shrimp in the spring rolls it looks impressive but when you take a bite you discover the shrimp is sliced so thin that you can barely taste it. You pay almost $6 for two rolled up lettuce and noodle rolls.
1;This place is way overrated. It is a decent pub place with good Wisconsin grub, but nothing I would wait over 15 minutes to get. Their beers are good as they brew all of the beer themselves which is cool. Yet, the Great Dane is more a big name in Madison that under delivers on quality of food.
1;Crazy show i was not sure what's to expect walking in threw the door all I seen was mascot suits and cocktail servers giving away free Jell-O shots upon entry that was nice going forward into the club was crazy there were mascots everywhere celebrity look a likes and midget Kanye west it was funny different  type of party but can only be a good time if you have a table no point in standing around there's no room for that it's a small venue and they only have two small bars. Fun industry party Wensday.
0;There are not enough words to explain how much I do not like this dental office. I used to go here when it was Colosimo Dental, and I was fine with Dr. Colosimo. Not wowed, not disappointed, just an average dental experience. Then, I met the new dentist, and apparently new front desk staff. I have NEVER been to a business that was like this. Not one person working the front desk seemed to know what they were doing. That makes me very uneasy going into the actual procedure I went there for. Then, the dental assistant I had talks like a hoodlum kid, which of course doesn't make me feel good either. In comes the dentist. Did. Not. Like. Him. At. All. He too does not talk professionally. I have talked to Walmart clerks who sound more professional then him, and I am not exaggerating. I told him that I did not like getting my teeth cleaned and didnt want them cleaned, I just wanted to find out what I needed to do to get the crown I needed put on. He kept pressuring me and making me feel terrible about not wanting to get my teeth cleaned and started SCRAPING MY TEETH ANYWAY. If a patient says she doesn't want something, you leave it at that. After this visit, I switched dentists (Premier Dental Care, amazing). I have been to many dentists offices over the years and this was absolutely the worst experience I have had.
3;Place is pretty awesome. It's a very unique way to sell pizza. Everything is well priced, and the service is fast. Service is average, nice girls but not all that friendly or welcoming. Food quality definitely makes up for it though! The decor is pretty cool as well.
1;After our drive to Vegas, I was starving! Since we were staying at the Palazzo, we decided to try it. I had the crab stuffed salmon and the other girls had mac n cheese and sandwiches. My food was just alright...not worth the price. I kept hearing about their so called famous mac n cheese with Doritos. Meh nothing special. Just regular old pasta, with runny sauce, sprinkled with some sad Doritos. The sandwiches everyone else got looked pretty good though..but way to rich and heavy. The service was alright but considering we were one of only 5 tables there at the time, we could have received some more attention and faster service. Overall, not a big fan.
2;This is an alright little spot. It's a wide open lounge area and definitely on the small side. But the cover bands / singers aren't too shabby and the waitresses are quick to take your order and bring your drinks. All in all, not a bad spot to hang out for a bit.
4;Delux burger medium rare (how they recommend it)...mmmmm!!! Such a good burger and get mixed fries so you can try their sweet potato ones as well. They come with great dipping sauces and in a little shopping cart which is cute and funny. I like the atmosphere inside, and they have a little patio too if it's not too hot. It's also open really late. I've never gone late....but I like knowing I have the option.
2;Great place for elementary school age kids.  Water park doesn't appeal much to middle school and high school crowd.   Rooms were clean, but nothing spectacular.   Overall grounds were well kept.   Not much in the surrounding area - although Arizona Mills Malls is nearby
2;This store reminds how poor I am. I mean, as I walked around I caught myself looking at my shoes, making sure they were clean enough if I had the urge or curiosity to enter a store. \n\nI did visit Bauman's Rare Books, and despite collections costing up to $400k I did not feel intimidated. The books did not judge my aesthetics.
2;My husband I just left the Firehaus and we were very pleased with the service of our bartender. She was very helpful, friendly and had great customer service. \n\nIn our time at the Firehaus, we observed an incompetent management team. While the bartenders became busy trying to fill orders for their servers you could see patrons at the bar with empty glasses including ourselves.  Management was sitting at the end of the bar sipping on their sodas and barking orders at employees. At no time did the manager  attempt to help the bartenders and clear their backlog. \n\nAs we were getting ready to leave we observed a member of the management team chewing out a member of the waitstaff to where she was in tears. This was done in front of a very crowded bar for all patrons to observe. Personally, I think this is a horrible time (middle of a shift) and place (in front of a crowded bar) for a reprimand to occur.   \n\nI think their management team is extremely unprofessional and feel for the employees under their leadership.
0;I dined here for the first time last week.  I was in town visiting some friends and family and went to this place with a large group.  i read the reviews here and thought this would be a great place to try. Especially with the $21 all-you-can-eat sushi for lunch.\n\nThe servers were prompt with taking our orders.  Our table was the second to place orders so I thought we would get great service...NOT!  I ordered a cucumber salad for an appetizer and three sushi rolls (rattlesnake roll, crunchy scallop and yellowtail trio).  Well,  it took OVER 30 minutes for my cucumber salad to arrive.  And I had to say something TWICE to the server before it came out.  By the time I got my appetizer just about everyone else in our group had already received and eaten their sushi rolls.  Why did my little cucumber salad take so long to arrive? Did they have to plant the seed and grow the cucumber?  My brother-in-law sitting next to me even got his sushi roll before I got my appetizer.  That was strike one!\n\nNow for strike two - I had to remind the server that I hadn't received my sushi rolls.  This was after everyone else was pretty much finished their rolls.  So even after I reminded him it still took another 25 minutes to get my rolls to me (Yes I was timing everything).\n\nStrike three - I get my sushi rolls. Luckily I wasn't dying of starvation because some others in our group were able to share their rolls so I was able to eat a few pieces while waiting for mine. One thing I noticed was that most of these specialty rolls had this stupid sweet chef's sauce drizzled all over. I don't mind this sauce as its great on dragon rolls.  But this caused everything to taste the EXACT same.  And this sauce was TOO SWEET.  It really killed the individual flavors of the fresh ingredients inside each roll.  My brother couldn't stomach it.  And when I finally got my rolls two of the rolls (crunchy scallop and rattlesnake) were DRENCHED with the sweet sauce.  And the yellowtail trio roll was nasty. It tasted sour like they marinated the fish in vinegar or something!\n\nIf you like sweet sushi rolls then this is the place for you.  However I will never set foot in this place again!
0;Dont now now is a new owner but i try to order sonething happend i dint like the old guy was very umprofetional i never went back
0;I think the large amount of turnover at the Monte Carlo -- hotel guests changing each and every day -- is what keeps this place alive, because I would be very surprised if their cupcakes actually generated enough repeat business to sustain itself.\n\nThe cupcakes themselves are a sight to behold. They are pretty and elegant, and quite beautifully made, and they will pull you into this store. So should you ever need a cupcake as a prop for a photograph, or as a piece of modern decor, this is the place to go.\n\nBut taste, and value for the money, are a different story. At between $3 and $4 a cupcake, you kind of expect to be blown away. You want something that is moist and fresh, and that tastes at least a bit like homemade, and not something that smacks of artificial flavors and that could have very well popped out of an Easy-Bake Oven.
0;Took my boyfriend here for an appointment during our lunch hour. On the phone we told them we had limited time because it would be during lunch, and we were assured the appointment would take no more than 20 minutes. They double-booked and his appointment took more than an hour, with the optometrist running back and forth between exam rooms.  Most of our time was spent sitting and waiting, and consequently we had no time to even eat lunch.  \n\nTheir selection of frames is very limited, with no name brands except a few Gucci hidden in a corner. And they have no contact lenses in stock, so you have to wait for them to be ordered.\n\nWe will be taking our generous eye care plans to another provider in the future.
1;I was so excited to come here.  I heard so much about this place.  It took 2 hrs to get our food.  I got the trio.  Not impressed.  Only liked one of them.  The only reason they get one star is because of our waitress.  I would love to give it a second shot, but let's just say that after tonight, Roy's left a bad taste in my mouth.  Ok, giving one more star because the head chef came by and apologized. Appreciate the gesture but still does not make it right.
4;Absolutely amazing! The cost is extremely low especially for the quality!
3;Yum. Love Schlotzskys.  This location was good.  Clean, quiet, and prompt service.  No complaints.
0;I should have read the reviews before preordering wings before the Super Bowl. Don't waste your time at this place. Those who preordered had to stand in line to pay for wing orders that had been sitting on a counter for a long time. I could see my order for 10 minutes before they would allow me to pay for it. I asked if I could pay at the bar or at the normal take out window. Nope, I was only able to pay at the cash register with 30 people waiting. This did not happen to me last year at a BWW in Houston. I asked to speak to the manager before posting this review. She did not appear so I left. Do not waste your time with these yahoos.
4;"I've been coming here since 2006. No better place to get a haircut and relax in the west valley.\n\nSnip is a no frills \""man\"" destination. Get a great cut by a great barber in a great place talking about anything from politics to UFC. He may be a steelers fan but he's so good I don't count that against him."
3;The crepes here are the best, the coffee is damn good, it's right on 5th downtown, artsy, conveniently open late at night, what is there not to like? Walking into JoBot is like walking into an art gallery on First Friday, plus you can get wired on caffeine and and carb overload on heaven. :)
2;Burgers are excellent but fries are too salty.
2;I love the lounging options scattered throughout the mall, the live music was a nice touch, and the mister fans are dreamy, but the store selections were less than impressive. I enjoyed my time there, but I think it had more to do with the fact that it was opening weekend and I had gift cards and other goodies handed to me more than anything else. \n\nThat said, I'm not a big time brand junkie and upscale shops don't tend to wow me. I'm sure there are many who will really appreciate this place. Like the countless people who waited in a humongous line for who knows how long just to get into the Coach store. I bet they loved it.  Me? I might go back for Wetzels Pretzels and a nice misty outdoor stroll, but that's about it.
3;It's the Boylan's soda fountain that keeps me coming back for more! I mean, I love the concept of this place with made to order salads. But man, do I love me some Boylan's Cream Soda! Only thing that woulda made this experience perfect is if they had diet cream soda. It only comes in black cherry, which is a strong second in my book. But let's get serious. There's more to this place than Boylan's (I guess:).\n\nI may have said this in my Oakland Hello Bistro review, but it still blows my mind that Pittsburgh doesn't have more, if any, made to order salad places. It seems that in NYC there's one on every block. So you'd think that would trickle down to Pittsburgh at some point. Finally it has, with Eat n' Parks version.\n\nWhich means the best of Eat n' Park! That includes their superburger and grilled cheese. If only they had grilled stickies it would complete the trifecta! But coming here I try to stick to MOSTLY (see: Boylan's obsession) salads, since they do them right.\n\nI love the fact that they toss in what you want, how much dressing you need and mix it. Those are always the main problems when you get a salad to go. I opted for their choice of the Caribbean Shrimp Salad. I thought it was good, but not quite what I had remembered it to be. THEN, I tried my friends salad dressing, the citrus chipotle BBQ, and went, danggit, I should have switched things up! It was gooood! My bad. Next time I'm doing things differently. But somehow I still think its going to be tasty. And as long as they have friendly service (which they did) and Boylan's soda, I'm sold!\n\nI'm glad there's now one in South Side too because I didn't think there were a lot of healthy, fast local options. I'll be stopping for my soda and salad again soon!
1;Just a dumb concept to have to stand in line to get food.  We wanted drinks first (unwinding after work) and then decided on food. The server can't get us food. So then we have to stand in line for an hour!   Not doing that. So we should just keep drinking and then drive.  Makes no sense!
0;This place SUCKS! You pay so much money for a detailed car wash and you get shit! The employees don't care. You always have to tell them to clean spots. They always leave the dashboard dusty. I also saw the manager yelling at a customer. How low is that? Very professional, right? My Overall experience....  Will never go back and will NEVER recommend anyone there.
4;My new go-to restaurant in Vegas for cheap Chinese eats. My friends and I were on a mission to find some good Chinese food and were so impressed with Wendy's Noodle Cafe that we ended up coming twice in a row. \n\nFirst things first, hands down, the best youtiao I ever had. Each piece was fried just right, brimming with crispy, oily perfection. And it costs only $1.95 and was definitely  a favorite among my friends and I. \n\nThe wonton noodle soup was delicious as well. I was looking for something brothy and warm, since I needed to recuperate from the night before. The wontons were crafted perfectly, with a generous helping of meat in the interior and slippery, soft wonton skin on the outside. Even though the dish is advertised with thin egg noodle, you can just inform the waitress of your choice of noodle. The broth is light but flavorful and was perfect for warming up my stomach. \n\nCurry fish balls were delicious too! Small, yellow fish balls served with a sweet  thai-curry inspired sauce made for a wonderful appetizer. \n\nChinatown in Las Vegas boasts an array of Asian cuisine. But Wendy's Noodle Cafe is one of those restaurants that shines just a little brighter than your typical cheap, Chinese restaurant.
2;"I am not a huge fan of furniture shopping. However, I recently moved and needed to get a new bed. My parents bought a nice bed set and mattress from Slumberland years ago and it is still holding up quite well for them today. I went to Slumberland on the west side of Madison 30 minutes before closing. Immediately my boyfriend and I was greeted and welcomed to browse. Originally, we came into the store to look for two side tables for our living room since we were redecorating. I walked out without two side tables but a bed, box spring and bed set for $800. I am sure I made our sales person happy. It is not every day you get such a large sale at closing. The bed was on an unbelievable sale as well as the mattress. To this day, I am pleased with my purchase. Our sales person was nice (obviously since he just had an $800 sale) and didn't bombard us. Whenever we had questions, he was quick to answer them. \n\nThat being said, I must give them a 3 stars because of the delivery cost. $100 is quite a bit of money. I guess I am not sure what I believe is a \""deal\"" or a \""steal\"" when it comes to such prices but considering I didn't have the means to pick up and set up the bed myself, I had to pay the extra cost. \n\nAlso, their selection isn't that large but once you find something you like, you run into a problem. As with most furniture stores, if you like one item, you just can't buy THAT one item but rather, you must buy the set. It is just unfortunate furniture shopping is done this way. \n\nWhile I do believe Slumberland is one of the best options for shopping for large pieces of furniture, there are some issues. Wasn't impressed with their designs and hardly anything that was on clearance was an actually clearance price. \n\nLast night, this Slumberland in particular is a lot more \""customer friendly\"" than the east side location. At that location, we were never greeted... not once. It was as if we were intentionally being ignored. That typically isn't the case for commission based stores..."
2;"I think I actually want to give China Palace four stars, but I am not sure yet... \n\nI avoided this place for awhile because of its generic sounding name. Once I saw the extensive menu, with vast vegetarian selections, I realized that there is hope for a vegetarian in need of a quick fix. And I have found the food to be well above average American-Chinese takeout . \n\nI really like the chewy consistency of their soy protein. I am a fan of chewy...I know it's not for everybody. \n\nThey do have brown rice! At least, they do now, and it's mighty good. A little chewy, too. \n\nLast night, I tried the \""Sizzling Sensation\"" wheat gluten (mock beef). The sauce was not as spicy or peppery as I would have liked, but it was flavorful and the texture of the gluten was pleasantly soft and chewy (not as hard as the soy protein, though my dining companion who is not a fan of the chewy likened it to gristle). I also had the broccoli with garlic sauce, which is the dish I usually count on in Chinese fare, and it was a delicious compliment to the other dish. Unlike the broccoli and garlic sauce of most places, the broccoli was not swimming in goop and it actually tasted garlicky and even tangy. The broccoli was crisp and fresh. The meal was entirely satisfying and I will order both of these dishes again. \n\nSpeaking of dishes, one entree that I can warn against is the \""Taro Bowl A-La-King.\"" Looks and tastes as if cooked in dish water... \n\nIf you do not like greasy food, order from the selection of steamed dishes, or \""weight watchers\"" items. That goes for just about anywhere! \n\nDelivery from China Palace has been quick in my experience, almost unbelievably so! In-house service is also quick and notably friendly."
1;"$5 cover on mill is never fun.  This place isn't all that great and I'm surprised they are still around.  Staff isn't always that friendly and drinks aren't usually that great.  For some reason I do have a tendency to meet \""interesting\"" people here so I guess it deserves at least 2 stars."
3;Chicken burrito! That's all I ever get from any Chiptole anymore. This one is kinda sorta hidden over by what was long ago a  Best Buy.
2;"I was sent here because we wanted sushi and it was late at night.  VERY CLEAN AND IT LOOKS NEW. Its like a big buffet of food, but like separate little businesses so its like a village, well sort of.  I am giving it three stars because we are a big group and seating was difficult, its a weird system of paying and the line was long,  Some of us were finished eating while others had not gotten their food,\n\nfood is excellent though.  and its so easy and you can take it to go for some reason the room service sucks this trip so we have been bringing stuff to the room.\n\nThere is a mickey D;s (mcdonalds) next store and everything is more expensive on the strip so a value meal there super sized is about 10 bucks...about the same for a meal here so its better healthy food than all the other fast food places around."
0;If you want to go to a Sports Bar and be ignored and treated poorly then this is the bar for you.\nWent there to watch the second game of the world series. We were seated right away.  We go the happy hour special.  All you can drink from 3-6pm for $20.Waitress brought us over our first 12oz draft in a plastic cup and left.  15 minutes later she came back and threw 2 wrist bands on the table and said that we needed to wear them for happy hour.  This was the last we saw of her.  The place was not busy at all. We saw her and 4 other waitresses stand up at the frt of the bar  I had to go to the bartender and get more beers.  The bartender was going to charge me for the beers because she said I should have ordered them thru our waitress.  I told her I would have but she never came back to the table.  We got one more beer and left this place.    DO NOT GO HERE!  There are MANY other sports bars in Vegas.  Go there!
0;A few minutes after our family's food was ready, we realized our toddler's chicken nuggets order was not served. Turns out they hadn't even started to make it. When we finally received it, it was raw in the center! I showed the cashier the raw chicken and she gave me a refund (she gave no apology and seemed not to care). Also, one of the salsas at the salsa bar was spoiled.
1;I had a terrible craving for Mexican food the other night, and found myself in this complex doing miscellaneous shopping. So my son and I wandered over to this restaurant, having not been before, just recognizing the name. Walking in, it felt large and clean. It took a while to be seated, and when we did we were put in a corner booth. The waitress was nice, but short with her words. I ordered the chicken chimi with red sauce, and got my son the bean burrito kids meal. Food was just okay. I find myself only coming on here to write so so reviews, and maybe that's not fair as im picky! Probably due to being stuck in a corner booth, the waitress didn't check on us once, and I had to flag her down to get my bill. I suppose if you live in the neighborhood it would be okay to check out, but I wont be back. There are too many other authentic places in town to come here.
4;We love this hospital! My son has Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis and is, therefore, a regular patient to the rheumatologist. Dr. Ede and his staff are wonderful. We would never go anywhere else!!
1;"Service is extremely kind here.  This was my first time trying NC bbq; I do live in KC, but don't have a marked preference for a certain kind of American BBQ.\n\nI ordered the small plate of burnt ends + a side of pulled pork (I know, I know... a side of meat, but it's only 3 oz., and I really wanted to try it since pulled pork is one of my faves.  Good thing I ordered it because the burnt ends were not where it was at; burnt ends came out cold and chewy -- not fork tender and delicious.  Apparently the burnt ends were a weekly special (or something like that), and they were so popular they became a permanent staple on the menu.  They came with a fat tire bbq sauce that I didn't really care for.  The pulled pork, on the other hand was much, much better, and I also enjoyed the sharp vinegar-y flavors of the sauce.  I also tried the bacon-wrapped jalapenos (nice heat, and the bacon adds so much incredible flavor) which were the best things I ate at this spot.  The hush puppies were alright; they did come out hot, but not being from the south -- maybe I don't get hush puppies / don't know how they're supposed to taste; these particular ones were dense and chewy.  Not my favorite. \n\nIt feels kind of dirty in here... not the kind of dirty you'd notice immediately, but there are a lot of flies here and the place feels a little grimy... but this is a bar, after all.  \n\nAll that being said, I want to circle back to how great the service was.  My server asked how the food was tasting, and when it comes to how tasty the food is, I don't mess around :), and I (gently) let her know that the burnt ends weren't up to par.  She offered to replace it with another type of meat, but I wasn't too eager to try anything else, so she actually just comped part of my meal, and I ended up paying for my iced tea and a couple of bucks for my pulled pork side.  After all of that, I'm just ambivalent about this place... if you do go, don't get the burnt ends, though."
1;"I really wanted to like this place. I've held off on reviewing it, since I wanted to make sure that I really let the experience sink in, and not give them short shrift if I could help it. Alas, in the end, I did not find it to be good value. Now, to be fair, I did not try the golf; I only tried the laser tag. But, when having a party with your kids and their friends,  breaking them up into two groups to play laser tag doesn't make any sense. If the area is too small or you don't have enough weapons to cover them, don't offer packages for that many kids. Also, five minutes is NOT long enough to play; the other places we've been run 15 per game. The vests are chintzy and lacking the number of targets we've grown to expect at other places. The maze is too small. \n\nThey don't make their own pizzas onsite. There's no soft drink fountain, so you have to pay per can. There's no chance of adding another pizza if the parents get hungrier than you expected; if you didn't order enough to start, you're SOL. \n\nThe staff, however, is so earnestly nice, and they try SO hard to please, that you just really, really want to like the place. Sadly, in the end, the value is not there. They'd do better to tear out the laser tag portion, really focus on the mini golf until they have enough scratch to take over the place next door, and use that area to focus on laser tag, with better equipment."
4;Awesome fast amazing service! Mike came to my office to fix my 5s and it works perfectly!!! I will definitely call mike for all my iPhone screen needs.
4;"A GOOD HONEST BURGER!!!  Thick, juicy and cooked to your specs.\n\n However-know what this place is.  This place AIN'T a franchise.   It is, as they would say on the TV show, a real \""dive\"".  It's old.  It's not polished.  They have old TVs with only a few stations.   They're cash only.  They sell fishing bait up front.    The menu is VERY limited (they don't have fries or draft beer).  The patrons range from snowbirds (local vernacular for North Eastern weather refugees), to bikers, to rednecks, to young families coming in from recreation at Lake Pleasant and the local off road racing tracks.      \n\nThat being said, I love this place.  It's a little bit of the old Arizona that existed before everything was homogenized and sanitized into uniformity.  The staff treats you like family.  The place is informal-just be yourself.  And they serve what is in my opinion (and many others) the best burgers in the greater Phoenix area.      \n\nRemember, we're talking hamburgers here, not Lobster Thermadore.  If you're expecting 5 stars or an Applebee's, you shouldn't come here.  If you come here, know what to expect: cold beer, good mixed drinks, a friendly, unprentious staff and the best burgers in town."
1;I was hoping for a great meal after seeing the great reviews, but not what i got. The place is dark like other people have said, and the prices are high. The steaks are big, but there was a funny smell about them. I had the new york strip, and some scallops. The scallops were big but the sauce seemed weird with them.  MY steak was hard to cut even as medium rare. The meal took almost an hour to get there. The waitresses are very nice, but the food was lacking. Never again for that price. I spent 90 for two people(steak, scallops, pork roast, and tip).
1;Great food but the service is so bad it's almost funny. ALMOST. I don't know of it's worth waiting for my food and having to ask constantly for refills. I would try it once but I don't recommend coming back for seconds.
1;"We came here after driving by tons of times and saying \""We should go there.\"" We got there around 8 on a Friday night, and it was busy. We waited for a table at the bar (where it was very loud), and I was satisfied with their draft list, and they had Jack's cider on tap which is awesome.\n\nOur seats ended up being at a very long table between two other groups. It was very 'get to know your neighbor' which is always meh.\n\nWe got our order forms and filled them out. I got a sandwich which was apparently a mistake not many other people on Yelp make. I accidentally chose cold, put an x through it and filled in the hot circle. My sandwich came out cold. Bummer. Would it kill them to give you a pencil with an eraser?? The small golf pencils sucked. Bummer #2: I also selected ranch, and the sandwich was bone dry. There was a small amount in the middle but it was very dry which I didn't intend. Apparently I should have paid the extra $.50 for mayonnaise and ranch. Bummer #3: I picked pepper jack cheese, and it was a VERY thick slice, which dominated half of the sandwich. It was way too much. On the other half, there was another thick slice of cheese but it only covered half of the sandwich, so 3/4 of my sandwich was too cheesy, 1/4 had no cheese. Bummer #4: I chose white bread, and it crumbled, (which having it toasted like I'd asked for would have fixed). Bummer #5: They only offer chips with sandwiches, but they serve french fries as part of an appetizer. They were very salty Ruffle chips. Meh.\n\nThe other half of my party ordered two slices of pizza, and picked chicken on his order form but didn't get any chicken. You think cutting out the waitress writing down your order would eliminate your order coming out wrong, but apparently it isn't that simple.\n\nIn summary: this place is LOUD, our food came out wrong, and their sandwiches leave something to be desired. I've had better sandwiches at Sheetz... Next time I'm looking for a good drink and sandwich, I'll head over to Carson Street Deli."
3;awesome portions of beef, i ordered the french dip and literally was sick of Arby's, this place rocks, i'll have to try the Chicago style dog next!
4;Another one that is beyond me on how it's rated so poorly. \n\nQuality fresh pasta, seafood, wine, good beers, pretty and clean restaurant with good service - yet people feel the need to rate it poorly? I wonder where they eat...\nA lot of people that seem to complain have coupons - not that I have anything against coupons, but they also complain about the prices. I cannot say this enough - you will pay higher prices for higher quality of food. Just because it's pricey, don't complain. You have other cheap options with more affordable prices. Don't walk into somewhere complaining about prices when you had the option to walk in. \n\nI will tell you this - the Penne with vodka sauce...probably the best I've had in town. It was perfect. The pasta was perfectly cooked and soft. The sauce was amazing. It was creamy, cheesy and you taste the vodka in it. Everything and more you could ask for in this dish. It tickled my fancy.\n\nWe also had the meat lasagna. The marinara sauce with the cheese - positively delightful. Appetizer, we had calamari. It was served with peperoncini's and cooked perfectly. There homemade marinara sauce really is very good. Nice thick chunks of tomatoes and a really good strong basil flavor.\n\nThe service was good and the server was super friendly and attentive.\n\nMy problem with this place is the location. I don't think it'll reach it's full potential because it's hidden. Also, the crowd that would be more attracted to this place may be more in the Centennial area. \nI hope it does succeed though. I love to see anything that isn't a chain do very well and make it to where the other chains can't compete.
1;I was so excited to see a new restaurant near my house, however this place was a huge regret. We were expecting healthy home made foods, what we got was a grilled cheese that was microwaved on ciabatta bread, onion rings and fries that are exactly like store bought frozen brands, an overpriced smoothie and a bland turkey sandwich that tasted like one you cold buy at a supermarket deli or gas station. The restaurant itself is small, uncomfortable with glass mosaic top tables that should be outdoors only!
4;I purchased a Groupon for two 80-minute massages, having never gone to Elements before, and all said, it was a wonderful purchase. Scheduling was super easy as I just emailed the preferred date and time I wished to use the massages (I was able to split and use one for me and one for my boyfriend - a wonderful surprise!!) and scheduled only three days in advance. I emailed my preference at around 2pm, had a response by 5:30 pm, emailed back around 9pm thinking I'd finish it tomorrow but then had a response within 10 minutes. Quick and easy for someone like me, who's in and out of meetings during the week!\nWe came in for our massages early (just because we were in the area) and while the room wasn't ready yet, the receptionist was very friendly and apologetic that the room wasn't ready (we were early - our bad, not theirs!) They still had availability the day off, as well, as I heard several folks call in to schedule same day. \nWe had massages with John and Cody, and they were both wonderful. Professional, very open to feedback and very talented. I had John for a Swedish, low-medium pressure (fantastic) and my boyfriend had Cody for a high-pressure Deep Tissue - also fantastic!\nGreat place for a reasonably priced/high quality massage!
1;Quick, decent nothing amazing. the fried rice was good and egg drop soup decent. if you're looking just to crave a Chinese craving it works.
2;Perfect place for a romantic night out or to listen to live music on a Friday or Saturday night or if you enjoy an extensive wine list.  A lot of people really like Arooji's.  As far as the food, I think it's mediocre for the price.
0;This place has issues.  I'm not going to visit here anymore.  I ordered the hummus  n grilled chicken with double chicken to go since their service is horrible and the staff really looks ungroomed.  It was $15 bucks n the food was ice cold so I warmed it up when I got home.  I believe in 2ns chances but its always something so I will make my own.  Sorry honest review
0;"OMG never shop or buy a car from camelback Mazda! They are The WORST. I love my car but I HATE this place!!! I had an awful experience with our sales person, it was great at first but after we were near the end it started getting real shady. I now bring my car in for what I was told was \""free oil changes, tire rotations, car washes, details every 6 months for my loan term\"" and it's all been added into my monthly payment - However, I come to find out that in addition to what i pay every month I have to always pay extra when i come in for these \""free services\""! I always leave unhappy and extremely frustrated! These people are low class idiots. Never ever buy a car here. There are so many car dealerships in Arizona- whatever you do avoid this one like the plague if you know what's good for you!"
2;"I recently stayed at the Trump Tower in a One-Bedroom City View Suite. Check in was a breeze; the girl was very nice and provided a lot of information about the hotel services. The room was located on the 49th floor and had a great view of the city. I loved that the room had two bathrooms; a television in the mirror; and a high-end kitchenette. The bed was amazing and the hotel air was so fresh!\n\nAnd now the not so nice: \n\nThe sofa was awful; I preferred sitting on a dining room chair. The walls had a few scuff marks and chips from past guests. The valet would take a long time and is mandatory. One of the \""new\"" bottles of water was half consumed by a previous guest. I could hear the train but only once or twice."
3;Black Coffee is really good here. I think prices seem a little expensive. I just had a cookie and called it a day.
3;Switch Steak. \nA steak house located inside Encore, right next to Surrender. \n\nNow this ain't your ordinary steakhouse. Afterall this is Vegas, and nothing in Vegas is ordinary. At Switch Steak, you get ever so timely environment changes (every 20 minutes) and fantastic food. \n\nI personally loved the decor, over the top vegas style! And every 20 minutes the lights will dim and dramatic music will play and the restaurant will literally change in front of your eyes. The ceiling changes or a new wall will come up....it's very impressive. \n\nThe food here was excellent!! I ordered a 14 oz steak...medium rare and it was cooked perfectly: \nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=h4o8e_Xbca2kXQO_vzOqgg&select=iU01tRSIP2nvA_rr008YuQ\nSteak was about $56 and sides were 10 bucks a pop. But definitely worth every penny! \n\nMy only complaint was the smell. It was subtle but lingered throughout the whole meal. At the end we figured out it was the leather placemats that were wiped with dirty rags...because it smelled like old dirty rags! Minus 1 star! \n\nI would definitely recommend this place for a special occasion or if you wanted a dramatic dinner. Just think of it as a transformers restaurant! Definitely more than meets the eye!
4;My driver was friendly and courteous, pointing out the different routes I could take and how long they would take. I wanted to tip him but I had unfortunately not clicked the right options on the credit card pad. My driver was till very polite and said he understood. I feel awful that I didn't have any cash on me, but at least I can let others know about my good experience. It was cab 7775 by the way.
2;This place reminds me of Panera Bread.  I had a breakfast sandwich and a frozen caramel coffee and both were very good.  They had some really nice looking muffins and cookies but I didn't indulge.
2;I'm a fan of this place, but something is lacking here.  Like they left something decline here.  The service is so-so, and the food is sub par.  To me, it seems like they haven't cleaned off the grill or something.  Evey thing seems to be filled with tons of grease now.\n\nI use to love the bottomless fries, but not so much anymore.  That says something coming from a potato lover.  \n\nIt's like this place feel into a rut and cannot get out.  Like they became too comfortable in what they do and just decided one day that what they do will remain the same and people's attitudes won't change.\n\nI do give you big props on the now endless root beer float.  But my burger was kind of blah.  I ordered the Royal Red Robin and thought it'll be great.  I've had it before, and this time I was so underwhelmed I could have stopped on my way home at a fast food joint and been more satisfied.  The egg reminded me of a plastic one you see in a kids toy set.  I'm sure if I were to have dropped it, it would have bounce.  The bacon was undercooked and so chewy that I pulled it off the burger and discarded it.  Even the tomato on the burger was making me want to gag.\n\nI remember when the place first opened and I was one of their first customers.  It was pretty amazing and dazzling to be inside, but now I feel like this place has turned into Chuck E Cheese for adults...it's lost its luster.
0;Ordered a pizza and salad from this place and the experience was terrible!!!!!! The delivery drive had music so loud in the car and came to my door with a cigarette in their hand. Needless to say, the order was wrong and I was told that my was order was not wrong by person on the phone. Total rip off !!!!
4;Best steakhouse that I've been to so far in Vegas.  Blows away Bellagio and Palms steakhouse.
2;Cheap drinks. Shots of 151 sitting in a pool of strawberry margarita mix.\n\n(Un)memorable nights ahead.\n\nWas great a few years back before Yelp got big. You can go in for a quick order and leave within 2-3 minutes. I'm glad they're doing well, but it's a hassle going to Fat Tuesday nowadays when you have to wait in line.
2;The service is really bad but the food is great. They forgot things that we ordered. I think its a bit too pricey.
4;You wont find better.  Incredible service, great pizza, and by far fair prices.  \n\nFreshest ingredients.  A true pizza oven, and very clean environment.   \n\nThe people that work there are the icing on this cake.  Down to earth, and genuinely kind/funny. \n\nMake sure you go there and have a comment on Nebraska Huskers....lol
4;I am so in love with this place and would come here for coffee everyday if I could. The ambiance is unlike any other and a perfect place to just sit back with a friend over a nice cup of coffee--which you can have brewed a variety of ways. I love their blended drinks and variety of munchies and pastries they have to order. The deli plates are perfect to share between friends. Sometimes they have live performances to add to the ambiance to make you forget you're in Vegas. \n\nBeing that it is very much a place to socialize, seating does fill up and can get quite crowded.
0;Worst hotel in a long time...  Upon arrival in my room I found several strands of hair in my tub and the tile looked unclean.  My soap dish was dirty from the previous occupant/s and mirrors riddled with fingerprints and toothbrushing splatters.  \n\nIt was nice to actually have glasses, a rarity in a Sheraton, but they were filthy and smudgy too.  I envisioned the cleaning person spitting into the glass and polishing it up with a wash cloth before it was rolled up and staged for my arrival.  \n\nEvery surface had an accumulation of dust only Father Time can pile on.  When I moved the ice bucket, there was a perfectly clean circle surrounded by gray filth.\n\nAt this point, I decided I should probably check the bed.  When I pulled back the covers, I found several black specs and the mattress cover sheet appeared wrinkled as if the bed was just straightened after the last guest and not actually stripped and changed.  To top it off there was a small squiggly insect (not a bedbug) cruising around.  I was not impressed.\n\nI have given this Sheraton one star because after I called the staff, they were apologetic, friendly, and helpful.  The front desk sent a cleaning person from house keeping to clean the bathroom and strip and replace the sheets on the bed.  I hope the company travel agent doesn't book here again.
0;I came into this place expecting good service but I guess not. I came here with 10 family members but unfortunately we couldn't be seated on the same table. So our food came and my table consist on 2 kids and 3 adults. The portion of the meat at my table compared to the other table of 4 was tremendously smaller. Not only this but the service was really slow and I don't even know why it takes so long to take out raw meat. Another thing that pissed me off is when I was cooking the meat on the grill and everything was already set in place the employee came and TRIED COOKING For us but FAILED. When she left the meat was not set on the grill correctly so we had to wait even longer to eat our food. And lastly stop deciding whether or not you can give us less portions than other tables cuz the kids stopped eating and turning off the fire when we still have food still cooking.
3;Good overall, I recommend it. Informal, fast service, our waiter was brief but he did get the job done. I had tap water which didn't taste great...no biggie...just saying. Good for talking while eating.\n\nDetail:\n\nTwo friends and I went on Saturday two weekends ago. I can't remember the time but it was somewhere between 7-9pm. I used to go to the Pita Jungle in Tempe near ASU a lot but it has been about three years since I was there and this was my first time at this location.\n\nThe restaurant was full, maybe one or two tables were free the whole time we were there and that's including outside. Service wasn't affected though.\n\nWe started with the large plain hummus, it was a lot, basically a whole dinner plate. But the small would have been too little for three people. It was good but not that different than store bought hummus, not saying that's a good or bad thing. Both of my friends got the Gyros which they thought were good. \n\nI can't exactly remember what I got, I wana say it was the chicken shwarma wrap dinner. I thought it was great. The chicken was tasty and kinda of sweet onions and it came with a little Greek salad which I liked. The orders were on the table oddly quick, not that that's a bad thing.\n\nI can't remember the cost, but it was not high for what you get.
1;"I hesitate to give The D two stars, but they did refund my deposit, so I guess it is only fair.\n\nWe arrived late on Friday (around midnight) after driving in from Orange County. We found the parking garage and drove up the narrowest entry I have ever seen. We continued going up and up and up passing dozens of empty spots that were reserved for valet. \""No problem,\"" I said, \""I;m sure this structure has a lot more stories.\"" We finally got to around floor 10 after making continuous and tiny circles that quickly made us dizzy and noticed that the spots were no longer reserved for valet, they were however either marked for Enterprise rental cars or filled with furniture. Yes, old furniture was thrown into empty parking spaces and in various spots out into the narrow path.\n\n\""Ok, they're remodeling, no big deal.\"" I reassured myself. We continued upward until we got to a dead end. No spots. Not one. A line of cars behind me and nowhere to turn around made me instantly frustrated. As I managed to get cars behind me to back up just enough for me to make what seemed like a 400 point u-turn, I noticed that not only does the parking garage not have an elevator that goes to the top, but it doesn't even have stairs! They evidently expect guests to walk down the parking structure in the narrow road. \n\nWe drove back down and into the valet area where after some negotiation I was able to get the valet driver to let me keep my car in the front of the hotel while I went inside to talk with the front desk.\n\nThe woman at the front desk was friendly but not helpful. She offered no solutions on where to park other than valet which was not an option for me as I was going to be in and out regularly and the tips and time would add up quickly. I then decided to cancel our stay but did not receive my first nights deposit back. (I called a manager later and she did refund my stay after much hesitation and negotiation)\n\nWe ended up staying at the Springhill Suites in Las Vegas. It was less money and absolutely excellent in every imaginable way.\n\nOverall, I am very dissapointed in \""The D\"" as I was very excited to see their new renovated rooms, but after seeing their complete disorganization with their parking and the run down casino that we walked through, it was obvious that they take no pride in their work. What a shame."
4;Saw this on yelp and decided to check it out. So happy I did because these guys are fantastic. They had knowledge of every product and even make custom vape flavors for you while your waiting. The possibilities are endless with these guys. Great prices too.
3;If you are from LA and love eating BC but hate the minimum two hr wait then I recommend coming to this one. This place is HUGE! and they have TVs everywhere! The servers were nice an friendly. Sharing with one other person we got:\n1lb Shrimp - Mild whole sha-bang\n1lb Clams - Mild whole sha-bang - I prefer this over the shrimp because its easier to eat and more flavorful. \nCorn- Lemon Pepper - Super buttery\nFried Catfish with french fries. - YUM and even if you don't order the fish you should order a side of fries.\nIve also had their gumbo which I wouldn't recommend. Has a kind of asian medicine taste to it.\nOverall everything was good! beats having to wait in LA
0;"On average, I eat at ten restaurants a week.  In my life, I have never experienced such utter disdain for the wishes of the customer as I witnessed last night.  My overall experience in your restaurant was one star.  It would have been zero stars except for the collective, attentive service we were given by an obviously well trained wait staff.  It's too bad that you can't train away indifference towards the customer.  My problem is with a Houston's philosophy of: it doesn't matter what the customer wants, you are going to have it our way, or no way.\nHere is what happened.  The fish sandwich is fried.  One of us wanted it grilled.  The answer was \""we can't do that\"".  Why not?  You have a grill.  One of us wanted the chicken salad with the dressing on the side.  The answer was \""we can't do that\"".  Why not?  Is the salad pre-prepared with dressing on it?  One of us wanted that salad with salmon instead of chicken.  The answer was \""we can't do that\"".  Why not?  This doesn't even deserve any further discussion.\nThe fact that we will never set foot in your restaurant again will have absolutely no impact on you at all.  It's obvious how little you care about our wishes.  What I hope has an impact, however, is that every single day I will relay my story of the lack of any customer service I received from you.  You see, I'm in the customer relationship business and my goal is to differentiate myself from you in every way.  I will tell this story to every client, prospective client, associate, and friend, as a lesson on how not to do business.  The positive is that the manner in which I treat my customers has been reinforced by your lack of basic business practices.  \nThat's good for me, bad for you."
3;This place is everything a diner should be!  The food is good.  The service is prompt and friendly.  The prices are quite reasonable.  The portions will not leave you hungry.  I am looking forward to my next visit!
4;Being from San Diego, I definitely have a good eye for taco shops. I've been hitting up another taco shop near this location at lunch and was just OK with their food. After coming to Don Tortaco, i doubt I will ever go back to the other spot. Their California burrito is a proper Cali burrito (although i recommend adding guacamole and removing pico), their tortillas are bomb and their spicy carrots are actually spicy and tender. Hot sauce is good. Overall, this place is exactly what I'm looking for in a local taco shop who can make carne and other items just like home.
0;"PRICE: overpriced for the quality of food the restaurant has purchased. \n\nAMBIENCE: This restaurant is pretty looking. With bright green walls and exposed brick, the grill is right in plain view and adds a nice hint of steel to the place.  \n\nbut it was ICE COLD IN THERE!  i never took off my coat and wished I coulda kept on my gloves. \n\nThe floor was dusty and gross. \n\nThey do not serve their food on plates. just small foil squares about 4 inches by 4 inches (the burger takes up the whole square.)\n\nSTAFF: super nice. college type kids. just two staff. Welcoming. \n\nFOOD: \nI WANTED: a chicken burger, but at 6pm when we came in they \""had no more chicken left\""\n \nWE HAD:  \n*one beef burger with lettuce, tomato, cheddar, a fried egg, & guacamole.\n*one beef burger with lettuce, tomato, cheddar, bacon, eggplant & pickles.\n*poutine\n*regular fries.\n\n-- soggy burnt fries ( i know what you are thinking \""that sounds like a mind fuck\""  but it happened)\n-- the poutine was about the worst part of the meal. The cheese curds came in a plastic bag, ripped open and poured onto our gravy.  \n--The one burger with the 2 giant long-sliced pickles on it was drippy! with what I DONT know?! The other didnt drip. \n\nGrowing up around the food industry, I am able to  tell how much quality of work was put into it a restaurant. I could tell the owner of this very small establishment purchases the lowest quality of materials he or she can find.  I would never go back. Not for a $33 meal."
4;"WHO CARES IF SHE ISN'T SINGING LIVE?\n\n Have any of the previous reviewers ever been to a pop concert in their life? Backstreet Boys? Christina Aguilara? Beyonc\u00e9? Gaga? At least half, if not more of their performance is lip-synched. Why? Because a true bangarang pop performance is made up of choreographed dance moves, multiple costume and set changes, lights and lasers, and sometimes audience participation. It is another level of live performance.\n\nThat said--we paid $65 for the tickets, and I would've paid double the price for the show we saw. Easily. Absolutely amazing. There is not a bad seat in the theater at Planet Hollywood. \n\nI don't know what else to say, except that she sang all of her top singles and I was scream-singing the entire concert to every song. Also worth noting, is that as soon as the house lights when down and the anticipatory screams arose, every single female in the room immediately slipped out of her heels so she could dance in the dark to Britney. HAHA.\n\nRightfully so. This former teen queen of pop has cemented herself in history at her newest Vegas show installment. I am still breathless and giddy after her performance, and that was two weeks ago. Am I rocking her \""WORK BITCH\"" snap-back hat from the merch booth? Please. Worth every single penny I paid for it."
0;Today I really had to question the priority of customer service at Z Gallerie at Kierland Commons.  I wanted to purchase something, but they only had one and it was in the window.  The gentleman who is the manager refused to sell it to me and offered two extremely inconvenient solutions - (1) order one, wait a week and return to the store to pick it up OR (2) drive an hour out of my way to purchase at another store.  As a customer it was extremely frustrating to want to pay for a product that is right in front of me, but the manager won't allow me to buy.  I think this was a last straw, I will no longer shop at Z Gallerie.  (Service like this might be part of the reason so many of their stores have closed!)  There are plenty of options out there when it comes to shopping.
0;"I usually give nice reviews.\n\nI understand the issues of a new, start-up restaurant.\n\nI know that Bink's will figure out that they need a few compelling menu items...as the limited offering, at this stage of the game, is odd. (After close scrutiny, there was nothing that 'spoke' to me on the menu.  I order an appetizer for my entr\u00e9e.)\n\nPortions were small...and made even smaller by the tiny plate the food was served on.\n\nThe \""NEVER AGAIN\"" was a result of the manager...and the server...under-estimating my intelligence and experience.\n\nI ordered a Stoli martini.  No Stoli...so I changed it to Kettle.  No special instructions..other than I wanted it stirred not shaken...I hate ice chips and a watery drink. \n\nFive minutes later, a frothing, bubbling, smoking drink was served to me.  There was 1/8 of an inch of hard ice underneath the smoke produced by either dry ice...or ???  It was a drink some schmuck would order on a cruise ship.\n\nI asked the manager...who was strolling around... to take the drink back...and please give me a straight Kettle..up.  Another five minutes goes by, and, supposedly, a new drink was delivered.\n\nI noticed that the vodka was very, very cold.  Having consumed thousands of \""up\"" martini's, I have a good idea of how cold vodka can get when stirred in a shaker over ice.  This drink was much, much colder than I have ever had before.  \n\nI also observed that there was a definite line on the rim of the glass that was obviously where the ice had formed from the stupid drink they first served.  I asked the manager...and the server...if they had just scrapped the top off the first drink and re-served it.\n\n\""Oh no...We dumped the first drink and made you a fresh one!\""\n\nThat my dear reader, is a fib.  When further questioned, the server said, \""Well...we used the same glass from the first drink...and made you a new one. That's why the line was on the rim\""\n\nIn my humble opinion...They didn;t tell the truth.  What I believe they did...was scrape the ice off the first drink and delivered it back to me.  I would bet $500.00 that was what happened.\n\nSo...I will never return.  The food, service, etc., was fine considering the new opening of this place.  The fact that the manager and the server thought I was dumb enough to NOT KNOW a real martini from a screwed up first drink, INSULTED MY INTELLIGENCE.\n\nI guess I wish them good luck, however, I would never return and will take every opportunity to trash the place for the fib I believe I was expected to buy.  \n\nBetter hurry...as they can;t last long.\n\nRule 1...NEVER, EVER go cheap.  If the first drink was not right...make me a new one in a clean glass."
4;happiness: all you need is the 8 corner pizza with the turbo crust. there's almost always a coupon for it on their website, which makes it a ridiculous $12.
2;"I would probably give this restaurant a higher rating, if it weren't for the service.\n\nWe came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. We came early enough that there wasn't a long wait, so we were seated rather promptly. I had the Croque Madame, which honestly, was fantastic. It was just what I wanted and had great flavor. It came with homemade potato \""chips\"" which were more like potato straws, but they were delicious. My companion got a breakfast sandwich, which he thought was alright (too much mayo for a breakfast sandwich), but did enjoy the side of breakfast potatoes.\n\nThe problem with the service was that we hardly saw our waitress. I don't know if she was overstretched with tables or what, but we were constantly out of drinks and I had to wait 10 minutes to find her just to get another OJ. When we finished our meals, we sat there for 15 minutes with empty plates in front of us before we could get our table cleared, and then find her for our check. I felt very overlooked while she waited on other tables (mostly larger groups).\n\nAnyway, maybe I was there on a bad day or just got a server on her off day, but with all the choices in Vegas, not sure that I will be back."
0;Only good for people watching. \n\nFood is overly greasy, I know its a diner but I don't think grease is supposed to ooze out of my spinach pie when I stick a fork in it.\n\nDon't use the bathrooms on the weekends...im sure its overflowing with stuff (I was going to go into detail but thought better of it).\n\nGo to the Toms in Dormont if you're looking for a seminormal latenite meal.
4;"The McDowell Sonoran Preserve is a great place to get away from the city without really having to go far. It's a massive preserve occupying 1/3 the land area of the City of Scottsdale and is full of hiking trails to keep you busy from sun up 'til sun down. I've been hiking it for about three years now and don't get tired of it.\n\nThe preserve is comprised of miles upon miles of hiking trails that allow you to enjoy the outdoors. There's something there for all skill levels; whether you are looking for an easy stroll or if you are looking for a really hard workout that gets your heart pumping. It's a beautiful area that allows  you to really appreciate the desert and is full of really awesome views of the city, the immediate desert surroundings, and the distant mountains.\n\nFor more information regarding the preserve, you may want to visit http://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/preserve.asp or http://www.mcdowellsonoran.org . At these websites, you can download copies of maps for the preserve.\n\nFor a quick but challenging hike, I recommend the Sunrise Trail. You can reach the Sunrise Trailhead by driving east on Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd and turning left on Via Linda. Keep driving through Via Linda until you hit a gated community. At the gate, hang left into a small dirt parking lot. This lot is typically full on the weekend mornings, but there is another dirt parking lot just before it primarily intended for horse trailers. The elevation difference is 1095' and is rated \""difficult\"" by the preserve which is one rating below \""very difficult\"". The length of the trail from trailhead to Sunrise Peak is about 2 miles. Once at the top, you get a great view of the Matazal Mountains in the northeast as well as the valley. It's definitely worth making it to the top.\n\nThat's just one of the trails I frequent and a route I like to take when I need to get some outside time, but don't have much time to do it. I usually take this route towards late afternoon and finish up at sundown. There's really so much at the preserve and I could probably go on and on about having logged in so many hours appreciating what is there. It's best to discover it for yourself. Checking the websites I previously mentioned is a great starting point as they are very detailed about what is offered. \n\nI highly recommend the McDowell Sonoran Preserve. I thoroughly enjoy my experiences there and believe it was a well thought out project."
4;I used to frequent petco/petsmart but this is absolutely the best pet store in Las Vegas/Henderson area. I wont go anywhere else as long as I live in Vegas. High quality products and customer service. Our pets are healthier and happier after finding paw prints!  Highly recommend at least checking it out!
1;Ok food ... bad service\n\nThe burgers are ok if you order a medium. .. if you like rare or another way don't expect to receive it.\n\nService was very slow ... 2+ hours for dinner???? Also 1hr and 15min into waiting at our table we get told some of our order is not available.... go figure.
3;N\u00famero one-o. Never let's me down. I had family come in from Mexico and now they can't wait to come back for more.
0;I am not impressed with this place, my original review makes this clear. However, the fact that they were closed on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend makes them useless in my book. I was bringing two friends who had never been there, and still haven't because they were closed.\n\nBusinesses up and down Central Ave were busy, especially Hula's. They could have gotten the overflow from Hula's but they were closed at 7:30 on a Sunday night.
2;Not so hot. We waited an hour for our meal. The waitress kept telling us that they were backed up in the kitchen. She did apologize and comped us a dessert. They haven't been open too long and they need to get the kinks out. Hopefully they will.
1;It's not bad. \n\nI don't go to many Arabic restaurants, since I can get the real deal at home, but Boustan is better than most fast food Arabic restaurants out there. If it still had the old management, I'd give them 4-5 stars. However, the new management isn't up to par. I've seen and heard them be terrible to customers, which would've never happened before. In my experience, they were just dull and didn't have much personality. Before, no matter what mood you walked in with, you were sure to leave with a smile on your face, if not laughing up a storm. \n\nService is key, come on guys - get with the program!\n\nSo long as they're fresh, the potatoes are good. I made sure to ask if I could try a piece and the server chuckled, well - chuckle all you want buddy, not only are my taste buds in check, but I'm Arab too and know my Arabic food. I'm not going to pay for something dry and tasteless that was cooked 2-3 days ago, either. \n\nChicken shish-taouk or kafta sandwich are the way to go, but this place has lost its charm.
4;Without getting into a long, drawn-out account of our visit to this establishment, I will share the following.  Arriving with an ill family pet, we were greeted with warmth and kindness by the front desk staff.  We didn't know how long we would have to wait, and we were told that because of the nature of an emergency pet clinic, there were no set appointments and no way of knowing how long each appointment would take.  We were fortunate to only wait a few minutes before being shown to an exam room.  After only a few minutes, a tech came in to check on our kitty and not only treated her with a very tender manner, but was kind to us, as well.  We waited a bit longer after that before we saw the vet, but once we did, we did not feel rushed in the least.  Dr. Brantley took as much time as we needed to discuss all of our options, her personal and professional opinions, and to help us feel as ok as possible with our ultimate decision.\n\nHaving a regular vet whose staff and policies we are familiar with, it was a little intimidating having to go to a new place especially during such a delicate time.  Thankfully, every person we dealt with was kind, attentive, thorough, and really wonderful to deal with.  I hope we don't have occasion to visit this emergency clinic again, but if we do, I will feel confident in my decision and that the care of my pet will be of the highest quality.\n\nThank you, Adrienne, Mark, and Dr. Brantley, with all our hearts for being so wonderful with us and our sweet kitty The Wookie in her final hours.
1;"I couldn't believe my eyes witnessing the long line of customers being milled through their doors. For a sub/hoagie with such bland and tastelessness being commercialized on as \""Gourmet Sandwiches that's mother approved\"" ...GIVE ME A FRIGGIN BREAK. As a foodie, I want flavor NOT cafeteria lunch line food. The people giving this 'stuff' 4 and 5 stars are the ones buying into these franchises... yelpers steer clear, do your research for original and unique before you're separated from your money."
1;Eh.\n\nThe service is bomb, but the woman manager rolled her eyes at me when they made my enchilada wrong. \n\nWho the hell likes chocolate mole on an enchilada? Many of their food items are odd and overpriced. Not as cheap as stated.
3;I really don't understand what people are ordering that they say that the serving sizes here are small. My meal came with a pork chop, 2 eggs, and hash browns, which I could barely keep all on my plate (it was so much food) and a side of thick sourdough toast (2 slices). Mike ordered the fives pot which was just a sandwich. Considering we had waited almost an hour for breakfast we also ordered a side of bacon (so yummy!) and one pancake so we could try a few other things. The people sitting next to me at the counter ordered the special omelet which also took up the whole plate. \n\nThis place is so tiny. There were three tables in the main eating area (which could seat 2-3 each), 6 seats at the counter, 3 more seats in the side room at a counter and two spaces where they could seat parties of about 4-5. \n\nAlthough it took quite some time just to get in (and you have to wait outside to be called, keep this in mind if  you are there on a cold day) it doesn't take very long to get your food. It took 10-15 minutes to get our food. By the time we finished they had already turned over all of the tables. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and the food was good. My pork chop was juicy and I loved the hash browns and bacon. Mike's five spot wasn't as tasty. The eggs were overcooked and a bit dry. He wished he would have had the pancakes instead. \n\nThey have some good eats.
1;"Ate here about a year ago and really enjoyed it.  Was looking forward to returning and checked up for recent reviews on yelp (which were mostly favorable).  Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed by my visit this past Friday night (6/21).\n\nFirst of all we made to wait approx 15 minutes for a table when there were clearly several tables available.  Then another 10 minutes+ for someone to take our drink order.  Another 15 minutes for someone to take our food order, and only after I got up and walked around the restaurant to find a server.  Another 10+ minute wait for our first dish to arrive - miso soup; which I'm sure could have been served much quicker.\n\nFortunately, after that, the rest of our dishes did arrive in a more timely manner.  But then...it was time for the BILL!  After waiting 10+ minutes after our last dishes were removed, I finally had to ASK for the check and was told \""our computer is down and it should be back up in 5 minutes\"".  I heard this server say the same thing to another table but that was when we first walked in, over an hour ago.\n\nNow here is the best part of the story! 15 more minutes of waiting for the bill and  then the server brings us some free ice cream for our wait.  After we finish the complimentary dessert and sit around for another 15 minutes...I have to get up and find somebody to ask for my bill AGAIN.  I am told the computer is down and they can't give it to me - we were actually being held hostage by the restaurant!\n\nHow many timers does one have to ask for a check before you can just get up and walk out?  What if we had a show or movie to catch?  Could we have just walked out?  In the end I had asked FOUR times for a check and waited more than 45 minutes to receive it.  That is just TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE under any circumstances!"
3;A nice mall with lots of shopping and food options. One of the largest food courts I have ever seen. Pretty much any food you could want (within reason). \n\nFree WiFi available in the food court. I'm from San Diego and have to come out this way occasionally so it's real nice to be in doors out of the heat!
4;My first 5 star.....hard to find....amazing bbq
1;"I was craving a milk shake and this is near my boyfriend's job so we went for lunch one day. The food was...meh. I would enjoy a burger from just about anywhere else more. The fries were not good...soggy, not crispy, and bland. The milk shake did not satisfy my craving. \n\nThe \""$5 Buck\"" lunch was a good price but the name was driving me crazy. If you say \""buck\"" then do you need the dollar sign? Seems like it reads \""Five dollar Buck\"" which...is redundant and doesn't make sense. But...that's not why the bad review. \n\nThere was a table of people behind us. They had a little girl with them, and I'm not good with kid ages but I would guess her to be 2 or 3 maybe? They kept walking back into the back of the kitchen with her...sometimes with a woman, sometimes a man. I assume they were the owners or something, right? None of them are dressed like they work there. They are wearing clothes that clearly don't meet health department specs...tank tops, hair hanging all over the place, open toed shoes, etc... They walked past customers in line, helped themselves to ice cream and stuff while customers had to wait to get their orders because these people were in the way. They didn't greet the customers. They didn't acknowledge the customers. That was bad enough, but then I go to the bathroom, and the little girl throws french fries over the booth into my purse. My boyfriend saw her doing it! After watching them walk around the place so rudely ignoring customers and cutting in front of them for service, I guess I shouldn't be surprised that their child would do something like that. \n\nThe only thing that gives this place the 2 stars I so generously gave was the other staff. They were suuuuuuper friendly and very helpful despite the owners getting in their way. Until the issues with the owners began, I kept thinking that even though the food was just...ok, I might start going here more often because the staff was so pleasant. Doubt I'll go back now just because I don't want to support those jerks."
3;Tropical Smoothie Caf\u00e9 has some tasty smoothies.  I especially like their Sunrise Sunset smoothie which is quite refreshing!  Made with Splenda, the calories are limited and make the drink a nice treat.\n\nI've stopped here before to get a wrap and a salad and the staff was efficient and friendly.  Since there's are two TS outlets nearer to my home, this outlet would be my pick if I wanted to stop for a late night smoothie.
1;"My boyfriend and I booked to stay at Red Rock for 2 nights over Valentine's Day because of the close proximity to my workplace. Upon check-in, I was disappointed when the lady at the front desk informed me that the king bed we booked online was unavailable and they only had rooms with 2 queens left. She said they can't guarantee rooms will be available and it's first-come first-serve. Huh?! \n\nFront desk lady offered that I can upgrade to a king suite for a \""discounted\"" extra $50 a night which I reluctantly accepted. I've never stayed at this hotel before and have only been at the casino to check out restaurants or go for happy hour. I've heard good things about the hotel so I was really surprised and annoyed when I discovered that my room was in the farthest end of the hallway of almost 60 rooms per floor, which makes for the longest walk to get to any hotel room, in my experience. I was cursing whoever designed this elevator/room layout as I was making the long trek to the room. \n\nAh, the room. It was definitely spacious. So spacious that it appeared all the furniture was pushed towards the window, leaving a dance-floor-sized empty space between the bed and bathroom. If this was their handicap-accessible room, they have succeeded in the fact that you could park a dozen wheelchairs in this space. I assessed the room and decided it was not worth paying an extra $50 per night. It was essentially the regular king-size room furniture thrown into a large space. \n\nI was now highly annoyed when I called the front desk and the same lady answered. She was nice enough to move us back to the 2-queen bedroom. But before that, she actually offered to lower the luxury king price from $50 extra/night to $35. Seriously? She was trying to haggle with me? This made me realize that she could've probably just given us the crappy king-size room at no extra charge in the first place. So chintzy. This kind of service does not deserve the 4-diamond award."
1;"I would actually give Luxor 2 1/2 stars...We arrived on a Thursday night, everything check in on quick and easy...We were also given VIP bands for Cathouse with free champagne for girls until midnight; at Cathouse, Mr Creep Carrot Top himself was there and staring at my chest in the pictures-which actually achieved our goal of finding the biggest D-bag in Vegas. Friday we attended the AVP tourney at Mandalay extremely hungover, 2 of us decide to go back and nap before heading out later that night. When we get back, my key doesnt work and my ID is locked in the room. I go to registration and they say they cant get me another key without an ID, and would even have security let me in to get my ID. It was a huge hassle to get into the room again, which ultimately I slept in the hallway until someone else in our room got back...and surprisingly, the hallway floor was much more comfortable than the beds. The beds were like sleeping on concrete...I woke up with a sore body and random bruises, and since I dont remember falling so I have decided they are bed sores. Unless free, I would not stay at the Luxor again."
0;"I am so displeased at this business that I have gone so far as to report them to the BBB. I highly recommend not going here, EVER. If you care to read the entire story it's below. Long story short: I received my $45 altered dress with a missing tie that went around the waist. They claimed I never dropped it off with the tie, and yelled after several times even after asking him to lower his voice, please stop yelling at me and to calm down They also hung up on me over the phone and never offered to replace the tie or refund my money after returning to the business for a resolution.\n\n\nLong Story: \nI dropped off two dresses to be altered on 7/12/14.  When explaining how I wanted one green dress to look, I used the waist tie to lift up and over the excess fabric I wanted to be removed to demonstrate exactly how I wanted the dress to look. I returned to pick up my dresses on 7/23/14. I paid and then asked if it would be okay to try my dress on. I stepped out of the dressing room in the green dress and asked where the tie was to my dress. The woman who works there instantly said \""No tie\"". I explained that yes, I did drop the tie off with the dress and now it has gone missing. The woman kept saying \""no tie, no tie\"" and stated I dropped it off without the tie. The man claimed I never dropped it off with the tie either and told me to go home and look for it because they don't have it. I left upset and went home to look. Of course, I didn't find it anywhere and decided to call. Again they said they didn't get the tie when I dropped the dress off and hung up on me over the phone. I called back twice before he answered and he started to yell at me stating that he has a system and the tie was never on the dress. He also said, \""you keep saying the tie is missing, but I have the same answer.\""  I ended the phone call with, \""I will be back in tomorrow.\"" I went back to the business on 7/26/14 and nicely explained that I had looked everywhere and not found the tie. I also tried to explain to him that I remember using the tie as a way to show how I wanted the alterations completed and that I understand mistakes happen. I said, \""this is an easy mistake and I understand. I just want you to make it right. I dropped my dress off, paid $45 for an alteration and received my dress with missing parts. I am upset at the service I received.\"" The man raised his voice and was yelling at me at how he has so many clothes and a system to how he does his work. He again claimed that I never brought the tie in with the dress. I asked him multiple times to not yell at me and to lower his voice and to calm down because I was only looking for a solution to my poor service. After about 5-10 minutes of this, I told them I would have to report them to the BBB for the poor service, respect and product that I received. He told me \""fine, do whatever you want.\"" And I left."
2;"Last Thursday we went to the new Sand Bar at Desert Ridge.  We found the last two open spots at the bar.  There was a good mix of people - both young and old as well as some left over from happy hour.  I ordered a margarita and asked if they \""hand make\"" them or if they make them from a \""mix.\""  The female bartender replied that she could make it either way.  So, I asked for my margarita to be hand made - non of  that mix crap.  When I tasted it - it was a margarita made from a mix.  Not very good...\nHowever - the Sand Bar DID redeem itself when I ordered the Ahi Tacos!  Surprisingly, these by far - are some of the best fish tacos I have ever had!  Seared rare, seasoned with southwest spices, topped with fire roasted Pico de Gallo and guacamole and served on jicama tortillas!  AMAZING!  They are perfect for the hot AZ heat and hit the spot without filling you up!  I will definitely go back there for those tacos!  Also - the bartender - Brandon (I think) was awesome!  He was witty and quick to recommend the tacos and a complimenting beer.  Good crowd, good food, good music as well.  Get there early if you want a table..."
4;Came in an hour and a half before closing on a Saturday and they were still able to get my dress pressed! Very friendly and great rates! Will definitely be back thanks for saving me!
0;"\""Not the greatest Italian-American Food\""\n\nThe atmosphere is \""old Vegas\"".  The food lacks flavor and quality.  \n\nFood:  I ordered the Chicken Marsala.  The chicken wasn't cooked long enough to be tender and wasn't flavorful.  The marsala was runny; like it wasn't reduced or tightened up and mushrooms were scantily displaced on the plate.  The steamed broccoli was so-so, and the free wine with the dish was okay.  \n\nOverall, I would say this place is for more tourists and medium sized parties."
0;While the shoe quality is excellent, their ordering practice is extremely poor.\nTwo pair of shoes were ordered on 12/30/13.  \nThree calls were placed after assurance of delivery on 1/3/14.  I was told bad weather, death, very busy time of year, lack of help....\nI was told the order was not placed until 1/6/14 on 1/14/14.  \nPlenty of opportunity was given for this company to fess up and simply state they were incapable of processing the order in a timely manner.  \nI was offered a refund.  Another irritating factor,   Foot Solutions processed the credit card immediately on 12/30/14.   Unfortunate they were not as speedy on delivery.
3;decent sushi for the price. great happy hour prices!!! sat at the bar and the bartender (Jeff?) was really sweet
0;One of the worst Indian places I have been in the USA.. Its a joke to call this place 'Indian Spices' because of thier bland, flavourless food which doesnt do any justice to making good Indian food with good spices and flavor.. (By spices I dont necessrally mean spicy and hot, I just mean flavours). It should instead be called 'Indian Spiceless' From our experience, I can tell these guys dont know whats Indian food and how to cook it.. \n\nWe ordered navaratan kurma and veg jalfrizi.. Though technically these are entirely different dishes with kurma being somewhat on the sweeter side and jalfrizi being on the tangy and spicy side..  What we got was nowhere near what we expected. Both the curries looked uninspiring and not that different at all.  Both clearly had the more or less the same well cut frozen veggies you get in super markets and more or less tasted the same..  Jalfrizi which typically has more sauce (gravy) was very dry (never seen it in any other Indian restaurant like that) and had virtually no flavour.. it seemed like some spices were tossed in here and there..  And to add to the insult, they prepared these wonderful exotic delicacies taking more than one hour to prepare when hardly there were any customers around!! \n\nNot only do the staff seem to not know how to cook Indian food, they also dont seem to know much about whats Indian food!   My wife had ordered 'Onion Kulcha' without seeing the menu.. (For beginners Kulcha is slightly different type of Indian bread like Nan..) Actually that item was not in the menu.. thats fine.. but instead of telling us that, the staff took the order and brought us 'Onion Nan'.. when my wife complained that this is NOT kulcha but nan, then the staff tells us 'Onion kulcha is Onion Nan right??!!'..  LOL!   Actually this was not a big thing, but clearly shows that the staff (eventhough they looked like Indians) didnt know much abt Indian cuisine.. I then explained to the staff whats the difference between nan and kulcha.. then to make things more comic, we could hear them arguing inside the kitchen abt this issue.:P  \n\nAlso the mango lassie was sour..  We came here seeing four star reviews, thier buffet might be good as most reviewers have opined here or most of thier guests are newbies who havent experienced real Indian food.. When we left the place, we were joking about the name 'Indian Spices' for all the flavorless food with no 'real spices' and exlaimed we could have done this food ourselves very easilyat home..
0;STAY AWAY!! If your looking for a fun and good tasting japanese place this is NOT the place. wasted so much money here. Went here expecting a nice dinner with the family and was very dissapointed!\n\nThe place was empty (so hard to find in the hotel)\nwaaayyyy over priced\nsushi was gross and not fresh\nthe chicken teriaki tasted like they thawed it out from the freezer\nthe salmon was over cooked\nhair in the food\nmiso soup and tempura was ok\n\nDont waste your time and money please!!
2;Beer, beer, beer, Wow! What a great selection. I really love the fact this place has so many different beers to try. They even have these things called flights where you can get 4 5 ounce beers for $8. Not to shabby. The place is not to big, but it is very clean and nice.\n\nThe downside, it has no food and just has takeout menus. Maybe they should invest in some food trucks. Also the waiters don't carry pens and paper. So when my group of 3 people were ordering 3 rounds of flights he had to keep running back and forth to the register. That really bugged me.
4;The first time I went to Le Cirque, I was charmed by the decor: a multicolored tent draped on the walls of the restaurant, the adorable monkeys playing on the china (Bernardaud, but unfortunately made especially for the restaurant). The service was attentive and friendly and the meal was simply delicious.\n\nBut the reason why I love Le Cirque and would recommend it is because I came back. The staff immediately spoke to me in my native French (as if I was just there the day before) and spoiled me with a little extra of my favorite delicacies (gougeres and toasted brioche). The foie gras au torchon is one of the best I've ever had, the lobster was great and our chocolate souffles were decorated especially for our 1st wedding anniversary.\n\nThe fact that the food is perfect is one thing, but it feels amazingly good to go back to such a friendly place. Whenever we are in Vegas, we know that Le Cirque will always be part of the trip.
4;It's the first and foremost company providing individual trips.Thanks to them to start such a concept.Usually there are only charters available nearby (that too only for groups)  , for people like us who have to travel own their own for sight seeing or not accompanying friends or business travel or weekend getaway. Friends this is a nice company. Usually phone is picked up by Fay, you might slightly feel language issue ,however she is very nice and is accommodating, They do trips from Phoenix to Las Vegas in a clean , smelling normal,comfortable Mercedes Benz Van. You can do 1 way or round trip.I took my round trip at $99(specials), which is affordable. You reach from Phoenix to Las Vegas in 5 hours. They take 1 stop for 10 minutes at Chevron Gas Station for getting fresh and sipping coffee. Robert was a nice driver , told about sites and lanscapes while driving on his way. Drove very safely.\n\nAt the Start of the Journey (morning) :\nPHOENIX STOP -  ALOFT Hotel Phoenix Airport - 4450 E Washington St - Departs @ 8:00AM\nAt the End of the Car Drive Journey (afternoon) :\nLAS VEGAS STOP - Bellagio  (Flamingo Rd Entrance) - 3600 S Las Vegas Blvd Departs @ 2:00PM\n\nIf you want to be picked up from your place they charge extra 15 $ for Tempe.,Arizona.\n\nVery nice initiate started by them for individuals like us who travel on their own, but go in a group. I recommended them to start something for San Diego and Los Angeles as well. I hope they do in coming times.
0;This place is overpriced, overrated, food is VERY mediocre, staff/service is lukewarm at best. We won't be back, please don't bother.
2;I've been wanting to review this place for a while now.  Been here twice and both visits were very different.  The first time I came in was at least a month ago, I didn't know what to expect but the place is very bright, I can't even imagine how the girls working there must feel about it being half naked and pretty much under a spotlight  the whole time because it was already starting to give me a headache the first few minutes I was there. Anyways, I was given a warm welcome by the server Michelle.  She recommended a drink and it was out in a few minutes.  I stayed for a while and conversed with Michelle and even the blonde girl who made my drink (didn't catch her name) stopped and checked if everything was going well.  They were very genuinely friendly, funny and intelligent.  5 stars for their service and drink was enjoyable, but the second time was just okay.  I was hoping I'd see someone from my last visit, but it was a different set of girls.  Ellen welcomed me right away and I decided to try something different.  It was some sort of green tea ice cream drink and I was a bit hungry so I got a teriyaki chicken plate. Ellen sat with me as I waited for my drink and she is very upbeat and friendly, but we didn't seem to have much in common as it felt like I was talking to someone in high school but it was probably just an age gap thing. I think the owner was in the corner making out with his girlfriend made it even a little more awkward. The teriyaki chicken came out when I was almost done with my drink and wasn't worth the wait or the $10 because it was literally just chicken and rice with some weird sauce that doesn't even taste like teriyaki.  Overall, it's a hit or miss whether or not you'll enjoy your company with the girls working there or if any of them are your type but the food is below average and the drinks are good depending on what you get.  Service was good both times, but overall the place is just okay.
0;I have to give a star but if I could, I would have given no star. Customer service at the check in window at the Las Vegas airport was not at its best. An older woman named Karen is one who is not very friendly and made our experience awful. She didn't greet us warmly but instead called us by saying next. No smile. Gave us a lecture about what we should have when traveling and went on rambling about it until we left her window. We were also trying to help speed up process by putting our luggages down for her but she insisted on us putting heavier luggage down first after already putting down a luggage for her (how can she tell which is heavier if the luggages are the same size?) She made us take luggage off to put the other luggage on. I've never had to do that with other airlines. Other airlines weigh the luggages in the order you take them off luggage cart. It would have been nice if she had engaged in small talk and to wish us a fun trip but instead we had to experience poor customer service and left her window dissapointed and upset.  There was a woman behind Karen, helping her carry luggage behind the counter, it would have been nice to be greeted from her instead of giving us hard looks. I hope the service gets better for that location, because they represent Southwest.
1;The food is excellent, however most employees belong at circus circus, not to the  Bellagio!\nSpending $90 for a breakfast of four which is worth it, it will be nice to crack a smile.
1;Deceptive sales practices!  Buyer beware!  The sales guy sells you that if you buy a detail package for $89, he will throw in three free car washes but really you only get two. One is counted when you get the detail.\n\nOk. It was bothering me, so I went in and asked for a refund for the detail and they made it right by giving me a free coupon for a works wash.
0;We will never stay at any Travelers Inn again. This hotel is run down, shabby, and not sure if I will be able to sleep tonight. I specially  asked for a non smoking room but our room smells of smoke. We were given two of the thinnest towels I've ever seen. The owners need to invest some money into new carpet and remodeling these very old rooms. We came to watch a spring training game and can't wait to leave.
3;Glad to see them open a 2nd location so I don't have to drive out to Fitchburg.  Lots of food - bacon omelet was good but I wish the bacon was just a touch thinner.  I prefer crispy bacon and this is too thick to be crispy.  Food came out quickly, but then servers were out of sight - never was asked if I needed anything else, if everything was okay, etc.  I waited almost 10 minutes for the requested take-home box.  I was surprised - I'd have thought they'd have their act together since this is a second location.\n\nLots of wasted space and hostess station/cashier is hidden if you come in the right hand door - people were coming in while I was there and standing around not knowing what to do.  Post a sign or designate one entrance.
3;I have been eating at Don Antonio's since they opened. They were a big hit back then and then they switched to DeMarcos (and the quality went down) because of some personal issues of the owner. Then he came back and it improved a lot but the owner still seems a little distracted and its not as good now as it once was. Sometimes I think they are a little short handed in the kitchen. \n\nAll of that said, they have some really great lunch specials and their pizza rules.
1;My friends and I stayed here for reading week feb 16-18 we were a group that ranged in age from 19-25. We got fairly decent rates for our short trip and that is why we stayed here.\n\nCheck in/ Check out: We checked in at about 1PM there was a huge line and it moved slowly. We were told we were too early and our rooms were not ready. I have been to Vegas many times and checked in before the designated 3PM time and had to problems. We booked two rooms and were advised to call a number on a card after 3 and to leave our bags with the bellmen which we did. After returning to the hotel after a nice lunch our rooms were still not ready. It was about 4PM by this time, by 4:10 we were able to check into 1/2 of our rooms. The other people didn't get their room until about 5PM. When we complained they didn't offer us anything so we asked for a late check out for that room for no charge and were given it. Check out was a lot easier as we prepaid everything and did not have to deal with any staff members.\n\nLocation: MGM Grand is very close to the airport and our cab fare was under $15. It is near the end of the strip, close to Luxor across from NYNY but it's a quick walk to the action part of the strip.\n\nFood: There were a lot of options as are as places to eat, drink etc. There is a great food court located near the Casino that had a great selection like an amazing pizza place and every ones favorite McDonald's. There is also a Starbucks as well. We eat at the buffet on our last day, it had a great selection of food and was fairly cheap $12 I think.\n\nThis hotel is huge and has everything you could possibly need but I would not stay here again, there was nothing over the top that would make me want to return.
2;The best way to describe this hotel is by saying it is a typical boutique hotel. Swanky decor that is not always the most practical or functional and cool looking accessories that are not really that necessary.\n\nWhile it's not located in the heart of downtown Scottsdale we found it to be a pretty reasonable walk. It is a little isolated so we had to walk through dark areas on our journey home after dinner, but it seemed okay.\n\nThis place is not for those who are looking for a quiet hideaway as it is situated right next to what seemed to be a pretty popular bar and the walls do not prevent you from hearing your neighbors coming home at 3 am. On one hand this could be a positive if you're looking for a place that's not going to give you a hard time for being a little rowdy but on the other hand if you're looking for a night of uninterrupted sleep, it might not be your place.\n\nOverall we thought this was a decent place. If we get another great deal like we did this time we'd definitely be back.
3;I am currently writing this review from the train from Edinburgh to Glasgow. Why's that? Because Scotrail have recently introduced free wifi on their East Coast service. Oh yeah! \n\nThe reception on the Edinburgh - Glasgow line is pretty bad. Never try hold a phone conversation on the journey. 3G cuts out a lot too. But now with free wifi the 50 minute journey doesn't seem so bad.\n\nI know Scotrail have a few bad points. They don't put on enough carriages at peak hours, during any snowfall they collapse in a puddle of panic. The staff on the trains can sometimes be very surly (but sometimes very lovely). And during the August Festival Season, the Glasgow - Edinburgh train is just unbearably busy.\n\nBut they have trains from Glasgow - Edinburgh (and vice versa) every 15 minutes. They have a train to Aberdeen every hour. And they do a pretty good job of connecting most of Scotland (albeit getting to Perth from Edinburgh is a nightmare, and hardly has any frequent trains, despite that Perth is the 'centre' of Scotland when it comes to rail travel, with the most frequent trains to the Highlands in Inverness).\n\nThe trains on the East Coast line are nice and new and clean too. And the trolley service from Glagsow to Edinburgh is appreciated.\n\nI'd say given the West Coast lines I've experienced, the East Coast lines are nice and I have noticed some improvements in the last year - this wifi being a big bonus. Kudos Scotrail.
2;The food here is absolutely delicious, lots of variety and quality, however, the service is pretty horrible! The manager is fantastic, but I really wish I didn't need to call him over every time I go because I'm waiting 20-30 minutes for a drink.
0;"What a disaster.  \n\nThe text message I received showed a car that I didn't want (Hyundai), so I used Hertz's website service to request a different car.  The end result was that what was on my smartphone and what was on their board were different...and ultimately the car that they had actually assigned to me was yet a different one. Waste of my time.  \n\nUpon my return, I waited, and waited...and waited for someone to give me my receipt. Shortage of people with handhelds even though it was the height of rush hour. More bad planning from the corporation becomes my problem. The man directing traffic sent me to the customer service booth; attendant there shrugged his shoulders, told me he couldn't help me and sent me back to my car to wait some more. He also asked me to voice my complaint; sounds as though they may be chronically understaffed.  \n\nNow, as I call the 800 number to provide feedback to Hertz (at their request/suggestion), my wait time is SIXTEEN MINUTES.  Thus, this public excoriation rather than a private one on an 800 number.\n\nOMG, really? REALLY? \n\nI typically like Hertz and use them for business and pleasure, but definitely will not do so for my next trip to Phoenix."
2;Reasonable HH in the bar area that is great for an after-work hangout. We ordered quite a few things off the specials and finished them all without complaints. In sum:\n\n-California flatbread was tasty and completely made by the bacon. Toppings were not plentiful, but adequate and the HH portion was reasonably cut into 4 portions. Not bad for $4, but I wouldn't order the standard size. \n-Boneless buffalo wings were just as you'd expect. I like variations on other dishes, but don't mess with my buffalo. Good job on keeping it standard.\n-Spinach-stuffed mushrooms (not on HH, but ~$5 for a small plate) were not my favorite. If you like lightly flavored 'shrooms, then great. I, however, expected more flavor and these were drab. \n-Avocado egg rolls were my favorite overall. Unique (at least to me!) and creamy, with a hint of spice that leaves you guessing what's going on in there.\n\nOur waiter was great, non-intrusive (though we hung out for about 2 hours), and cute...so that's a win! My standard gin & soda was actually kinda strong...in a good way! Though BJ's did not blow me away, it's nice, comfortable food that is great for all folks. I'll be back to try some of their extensive menu offerings.
2;Drove past on Power Road this afternoon and noticed it for the first time, because I could smell their smoker.  Went back early this evening for dinner.  The corn souffle side dish was delicious, as was the sliced beef brisket with sweet sauce.  I did not care for the cole slaw, though.  Sweet tea was good.
1;This wasn't the first time I had been here, I was actually here for the Sema party a couple of months ago. It was a lot more chill than that night, but one thing was still the same... They have the worst DJ. At one point I felt sorry for him and the thought of throwing something at him crossed my mind a couple of times during his reign at the turn tables. \n\nI remember coming here when it was called The Light and thought the same about the DJ then as well. A club without a good DJ is like a Club Sandwich without bacon... It's just not a club.
1;Went to see John Pinette last night, and it was a disaster from start to finish. Thank God Pinette was hilarious. First, they stuck me and my wife in the furthest seats from the stage, behind a black curtain. We asked the hostess to be re-seated, and she obliged, seating us way to the side of the stage. By the way, we ordered tickets in advance on the website. We weren't walk-up customers 5 minutes before showtime.\n Yeah, as some reviews mentioned, the 2-drink minimum is crazy. No prices on the menu. Automatic gratuity added. Huh? There was only two of us.\n I asked a host how to get a seat up front, and he said that a lot of people get good seats by ordering bottle service. C'mon, guys, this isn't the Vegas strip. \nWe've seen JP about 7-8 times throughout the years, but never again at this cheesy place.
0;we went to this place recently because their menu is predominantly Shawarma. They have steak and chicken Shawarma. The problem is it isn't Shawarma. True Shawarma is meat whether it be chicken, Lamb or beef marinated with the appropriate spices for about 12+ hours. I ordered the steak Shawarma. It was not marinated and therfore was not Shawarma. My wife ordered the chicken Shawarma and it was not marinated but a very plainly cooked chicken. They didnt even use salt and pepper. My steak Shawarma was doused with Tzatziki. It tasted ok but we were really looking forward to some real authentix Shawarma. Another thing that was odd was they didnt even offer gyros on their menu...wtf!? The women working there were ok but when we got up to leave they didnt say goodbye or thanks for coming in...nada nothing zip. They were just hanging out and chatting. The only plus was that the place is very clean and neat and we didnt have to wait becuase we were the only ones there. Also the rice and salad that come with the Shawarma meals is bland like cardboard. Very little rice and no dressing for the salad. Other Mediterranean restaurants really hook you up with the rice but not this place. Barely a serving of rice actually. So in summation if your looking for real Shawarma stay away from this place. Im sure there's much better out there.
2;Bon buffet\n\nNourritures tr\u00e8s bonnes (pour un buffet)\n\nTr\u00e8s propre !\n\nService correct !
3;This is one of my favs. Tucked away on a quiet street near the Allegheny River. I'm a vegetarian and i've always enjoyed the meals there although they don't have a ton of choices. It's byob which makes this an inexpensive albeit unpretentious and elegant restaurant. Most of all, I enjoy the pace of the restaurant. Everytime i've gone, I spent about 2 hours there, dining slowly and enjoying. Afterwards, a walk to the river. Nice.
2;Short story.\n\n A-OK but not Very Good at Price Point. I do note we only had lunch and maybe they shine more at dinner time. I also note three stars is still a positive review.\n\nLong story.\n\nThis is a pristine clean modern beautiful place. The tables are spaced nicely and we were very comfortable. The waitstaff looked mature. The start you off with fresh crusty bread with rosemary herb ed butter and sliced fruit for your water.\n\nI ordered the Tuna Sashimi Salad. The tuna was fresh and had a very hot and spicy chili oil under it that I liked. Unfortunately the sear on the fish was disappointing since it was grey on all sides. If I screwed up searing this same fish at home I'd get my pan hotter and not screw up the other sides. This might sound silly but I wasn't sure how to eat this salad the way it was spread out. The salad was OK but sort of boring and was just an OK salad at $15.00.\n\nThe Thai Steak Salad I might have sent back if it was mine and I do note it's possible they just didn't make it correctly. Number one neither of us recognized anything Thai about this salad but that didn't matter anyway. If it was my salad I would have sent it back because of the very bitter dressing and I do note they must have made an error making it because nobody would knowingly make something that tasted like that. I did taste the steak and it was OK. When the waiter checked on us my husband didn't say anything but told me about the salad after. I told him I wouldn't be able to eat it and mine was OK. This steak salad was $18.00\n\nTwo salads a soda and a iced tea $41.40 before tip.\n\nWe did look around and many other plates looked really good.
4;Been coming to Camelback Ranch since it's first year, always a great time, especially rooting for My Dodgers.\n\nFacility is just beautiful, lots of walking spaces to catch practice for both The Dodgers and Chicago White Sox.\n\nThe stadium is simply amazing, any seat is just great to catch a game. Plenty of restrooms and concession stands with a variety of food & snack choices.\n\nFree Parking! Always a plus.
0;Horrible service.  They do more talking then actually working. Brought my car in for alignment and oil change. Was told one hour tops. Three hours later still waiting. Don't go there.
4;We've eaten here many times and definitely prefer it over the Samurai Sam's across the street. They are always so friendly and the food is fresh and yummy.
1;Fisher Price Sushi...\n\nThe sushi was expensive and tasted all the same. I had 3 rolls from the specialty list and all 3 rolls were loaded with tons of rice which drowned out the flavor.  I can't believe I paid $15 for a roll that was mostly rice and imitation crab.  Sushi rolls should emphasize the fish. \n\nThis place did not live up to all the hype with their fancy names for their rolls.  Their rolls are good for people who don't normally eat sushi and are afraid to eat the real stuff... Fisher Price Sushi - my first sushi roll.  Yes, I am a sushi snob. \n\n2 stars for the cool atmosphere with good music. It seems like a fun place to drink just as long as you are not going for the sushi.
1;"This is a good story. We drove down on a very hot Saturday. We looked and said we would think about a specific car. Sales manager was running in and out of the store saying \""I have an idea - trust me\"" Wanted to go for a spin in the car were were looking at. Next thing was he came running across the lot with a tag and started pushing the balloons in to the car. Remember - it was 110 outside. As he jumped in the car - we jumped in our car and drove out quickly - we even passed him as was pulling up a test ride. It was really funny. Separate from that - they do have a nice inventory."
0;Can't believe that anyone who's ever had quality sushi would like this place. This place would be out of business back in Cali. Not only is the sushi boring but it's WAY OVER PRICED!
1;How excited was I when I spotted the sign guy on the sidewalk flipping an announcement for a French bakery?  Marveilleuse!  A bakery/bistro on a route that I take routinely?  C'est magnifique!!!\n\nFinalement nous arrivons dans la Patisserie Manon!  \n\nThe pastries were varied, but gone is the delicate touch and size of traditional French bakeries, portions are 'American' super-sized.  When asked if the truffle pastry could be cut in half, serve half at the bakery, half to take home, we were met with such resistance and astonishment that we just ended up giving in and having it served in its entirety, only to throw away the uneaten half.  Honestly, it's enough for 3 servings, and would be better enjoyed in small doses because it is too rich for such a large portion.\n\nOur second choice was a puff pastry filled with a custard, again supersized, but not as rich, therefore more manageable to the palate in one sitting.  It was quite delicious, the puff pastry fluffy and buttery, and the custard was creamy and perfectly sweet without being overbearing.\n\nThe cappucinos, were weak in flavor, if frothy.  It almost tasted as if made of a regular roast coffee bean.  No self respecting coffee lover would call this a cappucino.\n\nThe actual location is large, but feels cold and sterile.  Bright blue formica tables and chairs more fitting for a hospital commissary and enough super bright flourescent lighting to perform microsurgery on an ant doesn't add to the ambiance, which is non-existent.  The layout is confusing and unwelcoming.\n\nThere's a lot of potential, both for the space and the menu, but it is a far cry from the warm, burnished familiarity of a neighborhood bistro.  In the land of faux finishes, they could certainly do with some mood lighting, cafe curtains, and bakery smells or the scent of broiled cheese on a Croque Monsieur (a French bistro staple not on the menu), not the ding of a microwave.  Even a surly French waiter would be welcome in place of the two perfectly coiffed and manicured suburban housewives looking down their noses when asked to cut what basically was a piece of chocolate cake in half.\n\nSo my excitement lasted all of 5 minutes after walking in, alas I am not destined to have a convenient patisserie at my disposal.  My search continues...
4;it's been about a year since I have been to HYU! And I feel addicted! This is exactly what my body and mind need! If you are a newbie, do not be scared!!! You will feel so amazing when you are done! The yoga instructors, and staff are continuously friendly, and I can't say enough nice things about this wonderful place!!
4;"There is something about coming to this Station Casino that I love. It could be because it's just walking distance from me. It could be because every single time I go there I always have a fantastic time. It could be because I love the Station Casino commercials. All I know is, whenever my visiting friends and family come here they always enjoy this place more than going to \""strip\"" casinos."
4;Melody is amazing. She always does a great job, and she does the best fades around. If you need a great cut, Melody is the one!
4;Wow! This was our first time eating here & we loved it! Everything was great, the service but even better was the food. A must have is the Bacon Wrapped Dates & for sure the Paella Valenciana. The shrimp in the paella was perfectly cooked. Chef Oscar Sanchez even came around to greet the patrons. A job well done :-)
1;They sell their gyros in 4 sizes: 2 oz, 4 oz, 6 oz, and 8 oz. This is pretty neat as a large or medium gyro should be enough to suffice a hungry person. However, I have to say that their gyro meat isn't as succulent as I thought it'd be. The Greek salad wasn't anything special either. I gotta say that I prefer Niro's Gyros more.
4;"I think I died and went to heaven, and heaven has a name: It's Amena. \n\nI haven't had anything Mediterranean since I left Detroit about 2 years ago, mostly because there truly wasn't anywhere to get it in the places I've lived since then. I walked into Amena with high hopes because of good Yelp reviews and I was NOT disappointed. \n\nI had a chicken shawarma plate, falafel, lentil soup, and a couple of pastries (baklava and another that I really have no idea what it was, but it was delicious). Everything about it was perfect and just as I had remembered it should taste, and the falafel and baklava might have been the best I've ever tasted. The lentil soup was also exceptional! The staff are very welcoming and made my experience just that much sweeter; I could not have asked for a better local deli/restaurant! \n\nRun, don't walk, to Amena. You won't regret it."
4;This is a review for the Birthing and Family Suites.  My wife and I just had our first baby.  We stayed there for 4 days and 4 nights.  This place is great.  The care and attention they gave my son and wife was top notch.  The staff is incredible.  From the nurses to cleaning staff..... everyone was so FRIENDLY.  \n\nThough the Shea suites are known to be nicer, I hear the personnel is not as personal.  \n\nI strongly urge you to have your child here.
4;Best Of The Best! home away from home, ashton & scotch, beautiful staff and music, love vegas, love casa fuente!
0;DO NOT USE YOUR CREDIT CARD!!!! First of all, these people charge for girls which is a joke and second of all they charged my card $200 when it was only supposed to be $44!! Fuck this place. Sucks for them because my bank knew it was fraud!
3;"As we walked around the food court at Excalibur, I noticed someone carrying a tremendous, golden brown, crispy-fried corn dog. Hello, delicious food on a stick! I wasn't really in a \""hot dog mood\"".  I never am, to be honest, but after giving up on the other lack of options, we went back to look at the menu. \n\nHoly veggie hot dog! What are you doing up there??!! I had no idea this place also fries up veggie dogs. On a stick. In golden brown, fried dough!  I was a little reluctant. Would it look the same? How would it taste? I didn't know, but I gave it a shot and hot diggity dog I'm glad I did.  Yum yum yum.  \n\nWhile the veggie dog (mine)($3.69) and beef dog (husband's)($4.39) were cooked in the same fryer, I thought about the surprising fact that the veggie dog was less expensive! How is that possible?!  We ordered a fry to share ($2.79) and a Light Lemonade (with sugar substitute) ($3.69 for large)\n\nEverything was really good. We were the last customer of the night or else I probably would've ordered another dog, even though I really wasn't that hungry after the first one.  I wish EVERY food establishment would have a veggie option. Most of the time it's going to be a very tasty, healthier, guilt-free treat.  I do eat meat, but if there's a veggie option, I always take it! Glad I did here, The food was great!"
1;"Az. Pizza Co. was a disappointment.  The oven fired pizza was o.k., the service was wanting.  Our salad came out after the pizza.  When I asked the server if she had forgotten the salads, she said , \""No, I just have to go get them\"".  They were finally served after finishing my second piece of pizza.  \nThe salad was good, lots of fun chopped veggies.  We asked about dessert and the server told us,\"" we really don.t have dessert\"", we have a pizza cookie, but we are trying to get desserts.  \nPeople were having fun playing the ponies, very loud and intense at times. The music was blasting in between races.  I think the bar and betting is the star of this place for most of the patrons.  \nNot a bad experirnce but one that I don't want to repeat."
4;Great food.  great prices.  Will definitely be back.
4;I worked with Cole in creating a GF dessert spread for an event held last weekend. The entire process - from the initial order, through editing to delivery was smooth and professional. Not only did he deliver personally, but he brought along the Chef. Desserts exceeded our expectations, and we will absolutely be using and recommending their catering services in the future.
4;My new favorite restaurant ever.  I'm so glad this isn't the only one around.  One word: Butterfish. This entree was so tender and well flavored. Spicy complimentary edamame was a fun and tasty surprise. Also had the appetizer taster plate-  each part was so good(garnishes too) we cleaned the plate with a spoon. Service was positive & amazing. Will be returning.
2;It's an outlet in the desert....what can I say It was hot....there is a parking structure next to the stores and it was packed did not have to wait to long for a spot.  Bring water and your walking shoes.
4;The food is good and the staff is very nice and friendly. The total experience is always good.
4;I've been passing this place for years and finally decided to stop. I usually end up getting the Wolf Pack Special (Wineburnger and Coors Lite) not that I've been there multiple times.\n\nIt's a great dive bar, nothing fancy, just good service and good food! The ghost pepper cheese wine burger is awesome! Last time in I has the Super (two patties) which was more than enough to hold me over until lunch the next day.\n\nDespite the construction it's well worth making the trip to check out the Phoenix staple with memorabilia adorned walls and a great atmosphere for watching some sports.
4;"Loved it - spent a week last August. Got a free upgrade to a \""suite\"" (read - Corner room) with a pool view. Marvelous service, the bathroom was bigger than my bedroom at home. Loved the restaurants as well (specifically, Noodles and Shintaro)."
1;"This place has drastrically gone down hill over the past few months.\nThe service is CRAP and I had been somewhat of a regular and when I stopped in last night for what I expected during the usual happy hour, the \""bartender\"" told us all they had on special was their house margarita for $7. I looked at her and said, \""um...what? the house used to always be $5 no matter what and happy hour had all other maragaritas half off and $2 wells...so now, nothing?\"" \n\nEither she had no clue about her the specials at her own damn bar or they really dropped the ball on their happy hour since that was the only reason people went.\n\nNO THANKS\n\nTwice now, we have walked in and immediately left to go to Bar Louie. From now on, I'll skip San Felipes all together."
3;Did not stay here, but spent a lot of time here because we were at T.I. which is next door and they connect via tram.  Hung out at the Beatles' Revolution Lounge, saw LOVE, lost 50 bucks here and ate at Cravings.  Seems like a cool hotel and I'd like to check in and actually stay here once, my parents seem to like it a lot there.  \n\nThe pool though, amazing.  Huge area, waterfalls, all the goodies you could want let's say.  In a good spot on the strip so that if you want to shop you can walk, or hop on the Monorail from Harrah's right across the street to get to the other end of the strip by New York, New York and MGM.
1;"Summary: highly overrated and apparently very inconsistent as identified by other reviewers.  Extremely pricey, fills up quickly, no parking, but decent service.  If I was looking only for pizza, I'd look elsewhere.\n\nDetailed review: we've been reading the Yelp reviews about this place for a few months and couldn't wait to try it out.  So, we decided to make the short trek down to Regent Street; with the snow, the roads were interesting but definitely passable.\n\nFinding parking was our first challenge... there's no lot, and there isn't any space near the actual restaurant.  We eventually found parking in one of the hospital ramps across the way.\n\nWe entered the Greenbush, and were immediately charmed by the quaint and cozy setting.  It's definitely small - it'll maybe seat 60 people, and if you're taller than six-feet, you'll be ducking the entire time.  A hostess sat us near the bar at a small two-top table.\n\nWe browsed the drink list and menu for a bit; our server stopped by to take our drink orders - a Spotted Cow and a glass of Pinot Noir.  We also ordered the cheesy garlic bread with marinara ($6).\n\nWithin a few minutes, we decided to try a pizza.  The pastas sounded great, but this place is known for it's pizza, so we chose the 12\"" thin crust with pepperoni, capicola ham, roasted peppers, and basil.\n\nThe bread arrived; three average sized slices of fairly dry bread with a healthy dose of mozzarella cheese and a cold dish of marinara.  Light on garlic flavor, but thankfully it wasn't drenched in butter or anything like that.\n\nThe place was quickly filling up, and our waiter became a little more scarce, but for good reason - when the place fills up, you can't see more than 3-4 feet around you and trying to navigate the crowds is challenging to say the least.\n\nOur pizza arrived and it was burned to a crisp - the top was so burned that we couldn't see any peppers or basil.  The waiter said something about the \""crust wouldn't firm up\"" and offered to cook us a new pizza if we didn't like this one.  \n\nWe took one bite and figured we could burn toast at home if we wanted that charred taste, so we ordered a new pizza.  The second pizza arrived within 10 minutes or so, and it was cooked much better on top, but the crust was soft and flimsy.  \n\nThe toppings were sparce; the pepperoni greasy, and we couldn't detect much basil flavor at all.  The chewy/doughy crust seemed a bit undercooked, but given the alternative, we gnawed away on it \""as was.\""\n\nThe bill arrived - $46.  ZOIKES.  Really?  $46 for 2 drinks, an appetizer, and a 12\"" thin crust pizza that tasted like a mediocre frozen pizza?  Me thinks not.\n\nGreenbush = FAIL\n\nService = 3.5 stars (decent; got worse as place filled up)\nFood = 1.5 stars (highly - HIGHLY - overrated)\nValue = 0 stars\nMisc = 4 stars (liked the atmosphere and cozy nature)\n\nAs we were leaving, we came to the conclusion that the Greenbush seems to attract an older, more yuppie-ish crowd that probably enjoys the cozy setting, nice wine list, and bland food.  Next time I feel like pizza, I'll look elsewhere."
1;GREAT WALL OF SALT\n\nWe came here late on a Saturday night, after a long day of work. We were starving and just needed food. PF Chang's would not have been my first choice but one of the guys in our group was vegetarian, so we had to play it safe. \n\nWe decided to sit outside and do some people watching, while we were waiting for our food and drinks. There was a lot of crazy action on the strip.  Hey it is Vegas and every night is crazy.  The strange thing we noticed was that everyone stops to take a photo with the PF Chang Statue in front. Why? Those people aren't even eating here. Do they show there friends back home a photo of them standing on the strip in front of the PF Chang's Statue? Vegas tourists can be a little weird. \n\nOur waitress Kristina seemed to have a little attitude but then we found out she was originally from New York and that explained a lot. I know that sounds bad but I mean it as a compliment.  She was sassy and full of attitude but then after realizing she was from NY we knew she was actually being nice.\n\nI started my night out with the organic margarita. It is one of my favorites. In fact, I make these same drinks at home. Yes I stole the recipe from the PF Chang's in Mountain View, CA.  My coworkers all went with Mai Tai's. We totally needed drinks after our long day. See most people come to Vegas to have fun. For the last 20 years I have been coming here for work, so I really do not know what Vegas fun is anymore.  As you can tell because I am getting excited about an organic margarita. Look out Vegas I am on fire.\n\nWe then decided to order a bunch of food. We started out with the two orders of the lettuce wraps...one chicken and one veggie. The tofu in the veggie lettuce wrap was disgusting.  We also got a tuna Tataki, which was really yummy. My favorite part was the jalepeno on top. I always like some spicy to my food.\n\nFor dinner we decided to grab a variety of dishes. We ordered the shrimp, chicken & pork fried rice, Chang's spicy chicken, Tofu Pad Thai and the Kung Pao chicken extra spicy. \n\nEverything was edible but extremely salty.  We needed a couple of rounds of water to wash the salt down.  Honestly it was almost hard to eat but we were so hungry we just kept going. And I was not the only one at the table that made that comment, so I knew I was not being salt crazy.\n\nI would like to feel like I know authentic food.  One of the best things in my life was getting to work in Asia and actually getting to experience the amazing food. But the bad part about these experiences is that it ruins the taste of most of the Asian food available in America including chains like these. \n\nTo recap my evening here: Our waitress was great. My drinks were delicious but the food was just okay. I can hardly believe, at one time, I was in love with PF Changs but I am just not in love with it anymore. I wish I could share more but I just wasn't that impressed.  I honestly don't have that much to say, which is strange for me.
4;Monterey Bay Fish Grotto was a wonderful experience for my girlfriend and I. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. We got the sampler for the appetizer which came with 2 large shrimp, crab cake, and a bbq fish skewer. The app was delicious. My favorite was the crab cake which was made with nice lump crab meat and paired with a tasty hollandaise sauce. We both ordered fish for our entrees, she ordered the swordfish and I got the chilean sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly. The neat thing about the menu are the numerous ways you can get your fish prepared. For desert we shared a creambule which was just as good as everything else we ate. Overall we had a great time and I would recomend this place to anyone who loves seafood.
4;"I was so happy we decided to go to Union.  I read about the opening yesterday and since we couldn't make the James Bond movie, I wanted to do something different.  And indeed we did that.  It was so much fun to go to the recently opened UNION.  It is attached to the Biltmore Fashion Park.  When I went in, it reminded me of a miniature Chelsey market, with their little boutique stores, so awesome.  After walking around the different stores, we decided to grab a bite at Trattoria del Piero. I was impressed that for opening night, this was run so perfectly.   This place is run by Lisa G. and it is owned by the people from Queen Creek Olive Mill.  Lisa came to our table since I had a special request.  I was already blowing my diet with the drink so I wanted to make a little change in one of the dishes, she was very accommodating and very nice.  My drink was worth the calories, I had the Limoncello martini.  My salad was delicious, I had the Fruta di Mare.  My hubby  had Lisa's bowl of balls as a grinder and the Union Cocktail.  The place is really neat, so eclectic, cute little hipster girls with the berets and the guys with their funky black arrow like earrings and scarves. On another table, \""old school\"" older Arizonan who knows everyone.  So different and great at the same time, not a single Ed Hardy shirt in sight, yay! We bought a box of the cupcakes \""for the twins\"", wink, wink.\nI can't wait to come back"
3;I have am on my third lease. I remember looking to rent here with an ex boyfriend and this was our dream place. I ended up later moving into a one bedroom by myself. I love the complex. Its quiet, clean, and safe. Though my friend left her car one night and it got broken in to because she has a radar detector in her window. Kinda a freak incident. Other then the stoners that live above and over from me I have no issues. I can hear occasionally the people above me walking but its normal for apt living. I recommend this complex to my friends.
0;Slowest service I've ever seen. Severely understaffed. Waited over 25 minutes for food to arrive. And it was slow.
0;Terrible service.  They screwed up food order so after waiting 25 minutes, they apparently gave our food to someone else, we waited another 20 minutes.  No apologies or anything.  They do have a good selection of beer but that is about it...avoid this place at all costs due to terrible service.
4;Delectable,  reasonable, very good service. \nExtensive menu is kindly explained for a westerner.
0;Don't go chasing waterfalls...\nThis place was a huge let-down. Ordered appetizers and they sucked, cheese stix were undercooked and southwest eggrolls were cold. Service sucked...
0;We tried to eat here. I don't know why Paris thought it was a good idea to have this as the only place to get food in their nearly 3,000 room resort after midnight on New Years. On top of that, it looks like they didn't bother to fully staff it so a good number of the tables were unused and many that were being used stay uncleaned. We waited in line for about a hour, partially because they were letting all the Platinum and Diamond members in before everyone else. After a hour in line we were near the front when a group stormed out of the restaurant and told everyone in line to go elsewhere since they had waited 45 minutes for their food and were leaving since they had still not gotten it. This caused everyone in front of us to leave so we ended up at the front of the line, although we were still not seated since there were still Platinum and Diamond members waiting in the express line. After a second group left and told us the same thing (food taking forever to come), we too decided to leave. We waited a hour in line for nothing, although I guess it was better that we left since at least we were eating a few minutes later at another casino. Horrible planning on Paris' part.
4;First time eating at Benihanas. The atmosphere is excellent (good for kids, romantic, fun). Chef was very entertaining and engaging. Food was first class and we will definitely eat here again. Thank you for a great experience.
4;OMG....  By far the best food I have ever had.
0;God I love getting stuff in the mail, it's like Christmas, isn't it?  Especially when it's something good.  Belgian milk chocolate truffles, a shiny Luger, a diamond necklace, XXXL vibrators...who knows what could be in that box??  Well, I know what was in the box, but I'm not telling.  Anyway, so there I was, desperately awaiting my package from Amazon.  I was perched in an extremely comfortable armchair, waiting for the sweet sweet sound of the leaves crunching under the feet of the mail carrier guy walking to my door, carrying my package.  Except the sound never came.  And neither did my vi....err, package.  \n\nAt some point that evening I started becoming seriously irritated over the case of the Mysteriously Never-Delivered Package.  It seemed really odd that the FedEx guy wouldn't have shown up when I'd paid for 2 day shipping.  That's when I discovered according to the tracking, my order was actually shipped via ONTRAC, aka the shadiest package delivering service in existence. \n\nAccording to OnTrac, my package was delivered around 1:00pm.  Now since I'm not deaf and I was home at the time it was supposedly delivered, it stretches my credulity to believe that I could have somehow missed someone knocking on the fucking door.  The door like 10 feet away from that oh-so-comfortable armchair.  Not only did no one knock, but there wasn't even a NOTE left saying they'd been by.  \n\nThe bottom line is, it's their responsibility to make sure a package reaches its destination.  They failed.  This company really needs to look into their internal policies and their employees. Whatever the problem is, it's some seriously shady shit going on.  I for one will not be waiting to find out if their services improve, because I'm canceling my Amazon Prime membership.  I'm not willing to deal with the headache their shoddy services caused a second time.  Once was quite enough.
2;Came here with my Monday BYOW posse (I love you guys, long time!)\n\nThe neighbourhood was dark and bleak that night, so this place definitely stood out as looking like 'one of these things is not like the other'. It is a really chic, minimalist looking place with a lot of variety on the menu so there is definitely something for everyone. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful and given that we were pretty much the only people dining here, the service was extra snappy.\n\nI had the mushroom tart followed up by the tuna tartare. Both were done well, but nothing spectacular about either of them: the tart was buttery and the tartare was nice and not overly seasoned. I agree with Risa D's comment that the  math of the Table D'Hote  didn't quite add up, so definitely go \u00e0 la carte. I feel like the place was a tad pricey for what it was, but I wouldn't say no to going back again.\n\nLove the vibe, handwritten menu and service, but the food didn't blow my mind.
0;Stab me in the face..... This is a disgrace to the word, FOOD.
4;"I've been waiting for this truck to post somewhere within a 10 mile radius from my place but I got tired of waiting. So this afternoon, I looked up their website and noticed that they were going to be having a Truck Showdown or Battle??!! Yeah! It was called \""Street Food Throwdown!\"" - Slidin Thru' VS. HanShikTaco\n\nWell, Now it really didn't matter how far they were parked because I was gonna conquer two trucks with one appetite!! I got there around 12:30ish and there was a big crowd in front of Lee's Discount Liqs.. I barely found parking and went for The Slider Truck 1st. \n\nAfter about a 20 minute line and 5 minute pick-up wait, this is what I got:\n\n1. Barby: melted cheddar, caramelized jalapeno, crispy fried onion strips, bacon and bbq sauce\n\n2. Pep Pep: lettuce, tomato, crisp bacon. sauteed onion, melted cheddar and super sauce\n\n3. Yaya: lettuce tomato, red onion, feta, tzatziki and red wine vinaigrette\n\n4. Captain's Oder: roma tomato, arugula, crisp bacon, feta cheese, sauteed onion and balsamic reduction\n\nALL the Sliders were 'AAHHH SOMMMEE'!!!!! Angus Burgers were all seasoned perfectly, moist and juicy, bite tender.. Great Job! I don't have anything negative to say about their burgers whatsoever. I ordered their sweet potato tater tots and have no complaints either. \n\n* Only thing that sucked was that they ran out of pulled pork so obviously couldn't order anything with that. But what sucked even more was their  \""Mystery Taco\"" just sold out too, by a few people in front of me in line!! Yes, Taco since they were challenging Tacos.. Pretty Cool! Its all good because I got a reason to come hunt them down again, soon!\n\n*Judges did Announce the Winner by a close margin of 3 points.. And the Winner is Vegas's Own: SLIDER TRUCK!!!!! WOO HOO!!!!! \n\nStaff were all Super Excited and Giddy, Food was Perfect and Cost was Fair!!! I'd drive the miles for this place in a heartbeat. I will be back for more, you can count on that!"
4;"Honestly, I am only giving 5 stars to one item: The Green Chili Cheese Crisp.  Having grown up in Buckeye, I have gone here more times than I can remember.  This place was praticially a weekly occurrence in my youth.  I have NEVER gotten anything different.  Yeah I am sure they have other food items, they may actually even be good, but they could never compare to my GCC.  I may have moved but my love for these amazingly juicy yet crispy pieces of heaven has not left.  Every time I go visit my parents I have to stop by.  \n\nOther than that, service is so so, either you get your food in a hurry or you don't get it at all.  You should probably ask for a to-go drink cup as the regular cups are as old as my grandma and look kind of gross.  Oh and all the art on the walls is for \""sale\"" however when I tried to buy one once no one knew how much it was or who painted it so they couldn't sell it."
1;"The upstairs theater is nice enough. There are a few nice semi-upscale restaurants here. It's also got a really good swanky (and somewhat hidden) bar here. \n\nSo why only 2 stars? Well, because it smells like this is where all the diarrhea in the world goes to die... especially the parking structure. If you can escape the smell though, this is a nice spot for a date. The problem with that is when you go walk her to her car, you have to try and figure out how to have a good night kiss while your nose is telling your brain that you are swimming in a septic tank.\n\nThe new Waterfront mall corridor stinks like this as well. Maybe that's where the term \""filthy rich\"" comes from. What do these people eat?"
2;My stay here started off rocky but it eventually. I arrived in vegas from the east cost at 10 pm which is 1pm eastern. When I arrived at the hotel I was happy to see that there was not line. I approched the check in counter and was greeted by a cyborg like lady who showed absolutly no emotion not even a smile. she promptly check me and and I went to my room. After checking the room over ... to my dismay I found a few things wrong with the room. 1st thing was there was hair on the floor in the bathroom I was willing to over look that becasue it was only a little in the corner and the have hundreds of rooms to clean. next i checked the beds and found that there was some hair in one of them as well as some glitter looking stuff... luckly it was not in my bed but the person i was staying with did not like that at all. and the 3rd strick for this room was that there was debris all over the carpet. I don't know about you guys but when I pay xyz dollars for a hotel at minimum I expect 2 things clean sheets and a vaccumed floor. So I i called down and had them change the room. after waiting a while for someone to open the new room ( big hotel i guess) we looked the place over and gave them the ok. the room was upgraded and had a great view of the strip. after getting settled in and ordering room service I went to the fridge for some reason and what i found/ smelled almost made me vomit. Spoiled milk! that had expried on may 31st and this was 4th of july weekend. the next morning i went down to the desk in person and let them know how disatisfied with the quality of the cleaning at the hotel and my rooms. ( this is where the reason i gave them 4 stars kicked in ) afterwards the new nice friendly lady ( incomparison to the stone face cyborg from last nite) got Me a new room in the newly renovated venetian tower ( apperantly i was in the older venezia tower.) with a view, cleared my roomservice tab and got me sweet tickets for the bluman show which was in some great seats. Also the fact that i left their black jack tables in the plus may have help boost my review half a star. Also Tao Beach rocked too, along with the attached mall with the gondela ride. All in all this was my first trip to vegas i would stay here again at the right price and  as long as my room is rite and they need to kick up the quality controll in the room prep.
4;bomb.com .. And Alyssa was such a good server ... We'll be coming here more often not bad first my first time trying it
4;Great food. We love the Family Pack - 4 great burgers with fries and comes with a nice big drink! Affordable and good tasting.
3;"This is our \""go-to\"" Chinese restaurant on the North and East side of Madison. It's not going to knock your socks off or anything but it's by far the best in the area in this price range. The food is not super greasy or full of crazy amounts of that fake testing Chinese food seasoning some of the restaurants put in (I don't know what it is...but there are some of you right now who know what I'm talking about!). \n\nThey are not overly helpful on the phone but in the many times we've ordered (over 6 years), they've never messed up on an order, are always within 30 minutes of a delivery time, and deliver HOT. \n\nWe recommend the orange chicken, the vegetable lo mein, and any form of tofu--especially the tofu cashew (as a nice vegetarian option). I see that some people say there aren't veggie options but as a family that is primarily vegetarian, they've substituted tofu in every dish without complaint. And will make just about any dish you ask. They may not appear to be excited about doing it but then again, I don't think they get excited about anything....They just do what they do--Make good, fast, hot Chinese food. Really, what more do you want?"
1;I don't know why I keep ordering Chicken Egg Foo Yong from this place.  Perhaps because the lunch special price is cheap at $4.92.\n\nHowever, there is so much sauce laden on the egg that you can't even taste it.  This is the 3rd time that I've had this dish and the 1st time was pretty decent, the last 2 times were terrible.  I don't know if they changed their cooks but if/when I come back, I will order something else.  The place gets packed at lunch so they have to be pretty decent.
3;The location and decor are downscale, but the food is delicious, inexpensive, and healthy.\n\nPlenty of vegan options.\n\nThere is no alcohol served, but the spiced tea was very good.
4;The best grilled chicken and ribs in town.  Favorite sides are the chicken pasta salad and steamed veggies. YUM!!!
4;Love this place! Tried the chicken and waffles and it definitely was a good choice! Love coming here for dinner or brunch I never leave unhappy!
0;Service was horrible. 1/2 hr after being seated we were still looking for our waiter. Then it took an hour before the food arrived. I had the Chili Colorado. Bad. Wrong cut of meat was used, and it was improperly prepared and then served in what tasted like cheap canned enchilada sauce. Even the margarita didn't come as requested. I won't be back.
3;Really solid restaurant. Great service from the volunteer staff. The food was really excellent as well- had a dhaal soup and a lamb dish and creme brulee that were all really well made. The value is pretty good as well (something around 40 canadian with gratuity included for a soup/entree/dessert). would definitely recommend.
2;Great room and view. The room was modern and chic.The bed and pillows were so comfortable, we slept like rocks. Also, for the first time ever in a hotel, did the sheets and bed linens not smell like that typical hotel smell/ cheap detergent smell which was extremely pleasant... Buffets are excellent, cheaply priced compared to other hotels and plenty to choose from. However, I was not happy with the dumb resort fees ($25-30/night) that we were unaware of until we checked in. We already paid $100 bucks to upgrade to a suite but apparently that wasn't enough to pay.  Just be aware of the hidden fees people. Not sure we will return after talking to kristina who was rude and took no accountability and had no apology for her employee at reception who failed to mention the resort and security fees were per night, not a one time fee. Can't stand people like that. Just say sorry for fu*king up and be done with it. Geez! Other than her and the dumb fees, everyone was helpful and friendly.
2;"SOLID 3 stars from me on my first and recent visit to Beef and Bottle. Old school, local steakhouse the sets the mood with dark lighting, carpeted floors and rat pack music in the background. We went on 1/2 price wine night, which is the way to go. Ordered the 14oz New York Strip med-rare and it came out perfect. Flavor was good, though I like a little more char on the outside. Came w/one side and the \""create your own salad\"" for $34. Not bad and I appreciate the side included in the price. I ordered the button mushrooms and onion rings on the side, though the steak does come with an onion ring garnish.\n\nThe cheese & crackers are old school. Good cheese spread with crackers still in the packet. Reminds me of the supper clubs I grew up going to in the upper Midwest. I also add a chance to taste my wife's shrimp cocktail that she ordered as part of her filet combo special that night...just ok on the shrimp. They were small and had that recent defrosted taste to them, which was a downer. Service was friendly and attentive. It's a casual place where you can save some money and get a really good steak for the money."
2;My friend and I went here to grab a drink and appetizer before the LOVE show.  The drinks were great, the scene was cool, and the service was good, but the food was not.  It wasn't terrible, but for the price of the food there wasn't much flavor or much there.
4;This place is awesome.  We had a great experience throughout the game (other than the final score), from easy and affordable parking to good traffic flow after the game.  The security guards and ushers were helpful, and offered to take pictures for my family.  Food was priced alright, with a wide selection, and quick lines.  There didn't seem to be a bad seat in the house and the video boards were great.  Took my wife and two young kids and had a great time.
3;TOO BAD IT'S CLOSED!  Best Lemonade Around!  I weep for their fresh squeezed lemonade made with sugar cane syrup with sugar cane sticks to chew on.  (And they would bring you a 'side shaker' full of extra - like when you get a really good milkshake at a soda fountain!)  I used to love the Cuban sandwich, even though it made you feel like you needed a nap afterwards!  Why they got rid of this chain when there is such CRAP around here that should close down is beyond me...
3;I'm not a burger kind of guy and I LOVE CREATE.  Between the friendly demeanor of the kids working there, the top-to-bottom versatility of what your burger can be, and the milkshakes/frozen custard bar, it's a hip spin on burger places.\n\nI usually don't eat fast food since it's greasy and terrible for you.  But being that the food is prepared fresh and cooked to order (Uh... dunno about that one reviewer but I always get my burger medium-rare, so I don't know where they're getting 'not cooked to order.'), without preservatives or feeling like I was putting an artery-bomb in my body, I love their food.  My favorites are the modernist and the dali.  Mmmm, mushrooms and avocado....\n\nBut it's literally a build from the ground up style burger joint that allows you to customize it to no end.  The price is very reasonable and the sweet potato fries are indeed delicious.
3;My favorite fast food burger joint. Never disappoints and at a reasonable price. It always gets packed around lunch time and seats are not always available.  Only thing that bothers me is that they charge extra for ranch when you buy onion rings. That's like charging extra for ice when you order a lemonade. It just goes together. Maybe they should charge after the second container of ranch but the first should be free. No worries, I found a perfect solution to that problem: Don't buy the dam onion rings, their loss. Just hate it when restaurants try to be sneaky about raising prices by adding them on to something else. One more thing, I could not figure out why my kids refused to eat here until one day I ordered a kids meal for my self and the burger was awful, just dry and gross. I would not want to eat that either so now we let them order a #1 from the adults menu.
1;"The people there have mental problems! Seriously, I have never had more bizarre treatment by people in a restaurant. I ordered a dish that happened to have the rice separately; it was meant to be mixed with the other sauces and veggies and such. I have a rice allergy, so I was pleased as punch that it came separately so I could just avoid it. I'm used to doing that.\n\nThe waitress saw me doing that -- not mixing everything with my rice -- and had a cow. She looked like she had just laid an egg and came clucking over to me and explaining that they had to be mixed, etc. I told her about my allergy and that I wasn't going to eat the rice. Her jaw literally dropped, and she ran away -- get this -- to bring the manager over so he could talk to me. \n\nI spent almost 10 entire minutes, completely embarrassed while my date sat across from me and tried to keep from laughing, listening to the manager and this waitress crowd around me and insist that it wouldn't taste right without the rice, I HAD to mix the rice, please mix the rice...oh. my. GOD. It's an allergy, people! \n\nWhen they finally went away, they sat a few tables away and literally just watched me eat the rest of the time until I left. What creepy people! No other Korean restaurant I've ever been has had such total weirdos; this place is just \""special\""!"
2;We hit this place after being at Dos Gringos the night before and it was not of the same caliber.  We were one of only a few people in the place, so it is hard to say if it is a cool hang out place.
4;What a gem in old montreal neighborhood.  you'd never expect such a charming, affordable french restaurant that delivers such high quality dishes in the most touristy neighborhood.\n\nHad the watercress soup which was probably potato-based.  My fish of the day (turbot) was cooked perfectly and topped with capers.  So tender and flavorful.  Husband had the calf liver in onion sauce and it was heavenly.  Tasted almost like beef with none of the livery taste.  Onion sauce had a very intense, beefy flavor.  We shared the orange cake and a slice of sugar pie for dessert.
2;Getting caught up on places I've been but never reviewed. For some reason I've reviewed almost none of the spots I've been to in Vegas over my last couple years in Vegas! With insomnia, suddenly seems like a good idea....\n\nAnyway! I really like to stay at THEhotel so have been here multiple times for business lunches and that kind of thing. Like the easy setting, but for the prices, the food doesn't quite live up to expectations. I tend to order seafood here, have had crab and lobster sandwiches and salads. Heavier than it needs to be and a bit more over the top than necessary. But a good standby nonetheless, especially if staying at THEhotel.
3;"I'm a total tom boy. I chop my hair short. My girlfriends begrudge my wardrobe -- t shirts or tanks, ripped jeans or cut-offs, tennis shoes, and a belt. A good day for me? Out on a boat, fishing with grubs, a cooler of beer and a pound of beef jerky. But, every couple of weeks or so, I find it necessary to pander to my softer side. And I do that by -- yes -- getting my nails done. Full on, French tipped, acrylic nails. To be honest, though, I should probably get them done more like once a week, because as soon as I'm out the door, I pay no attention to the upkeep of this sometimes costly habit in maintaining some shred of femininity. When I walked into Pink Nail Salon (located on the corner of Flamingo and Easter, right next to Taco Time), a couple of my nails were cracked and some were even missing. I requested a fill and some \""minor\"" repair work, and was asked to sit down at a table. When the poor little tech inspected my digits, she softly exclaimed, \""Ohhh myyyyyy gaaaaaaah....\"" Then she sheepishly smiled up at me and got to work.  You know, even if it weren't for all the repairs at hand (ha), I still think she would have taken her time. Which I honestly appreciate. The last time I got a full set somewhere else, it took about twenty minutes, which was just about the length of the manicure's life span. I may be rough on my hands, but I would expect at least a couple hours out of thirty bucks worth of work. So, let's see ... given the repairs, the rebuilds, the fill, plus the airbrushing on the tips to make them all match, my tab should have roughly been about $35. But, being as it was my first visit, she knocked it down to a flat $20. Naturally, I tipped (another pun, if you want to reach for it) her at full cost. And they look fabulous.\n\nOften times, older nail salons can have a dirty or dingy feel to them. But Pink is bright, clean, and new, and the staff was incredibly friendly. One of the other nail techs, who wasn't with a client at the moment, even shared a newspaper article she found about a two-headed piglet born in Ontario. I had a great experience there, and I'm very pleased to FINALLY say I have found a salon in Vegas that I will definitely be going back to.\n\n\nThree days later, and still lookin' good, y'all."
0;Not friendly. Don't care because it is good enough for government work. I think if I work there I would lose my mind. This place is below 50ft of crap
2;Ended up here 3x during our stay at the Cosmopolitan for breakfast, lunch, and late-night. Not only was it convenient (location and hours) but the food did not disappoint. \n\n-Corned beef hash topped w/eggs over easy - Great breakfast option. Really enjoyed how they cooked the corned beef. \n- Henry burger - It was good but nothing special. Ordered it medium and it came out very pink. I didn't mind, but worth noting. \n- Deep fried mac and beer cheese - Fried deliciousness. The dipping sauce complimented it well. If you're going to try one thing here, I recommend the mac and cheese.    \n- Truffle tater tots - So crispy and tasty. A nice alternative to fries.
3;Menu is fine. Beers are not cheap but I love the beer tour.
1;Went in n a Valpak coupon. Had dinner there. It was super slow, but thought maybe because nothing else is open around them.The Super market was closed down. The service was friendly, that's a Pro. the Cons, where do I start. Food was hot on one side, colder on the other or in the core of the meat. Wierd.\nFood took a lil longer, but that was ok, if it was busy. \nIt was a lil $$$ for the quality of the food. I will not leave Pei Wei again, I swear.\nMy last thought, we should of ate next door at Los Fav taco shop.
4;This was a small, quaint establishment, but we were seated right away because we had made reservations. They had a great selections of Louisiana craft beers at a great price. For starters we had the charbroiled oysters and crab cake. The oysters were Cooked in garlic butter with lemon and Parmesan cheese. They were great with a nice piece of crusty bread. The crab cake was good, not fantastic, but tasty nonetheless. Our group had the jambalaya and the bronzed shrimp and grits. Jambalaya portion was huge and it was nice and spicy! The shrimp were fantastic, plump, flavorful, and spicy. The grits were creamy, and the Gouda cheese was a great addition. Wish we would have had the room for dessert! I' d go back in a heartbeat!
1;I went to this salon based on reviews from Yelp. It was quite disappointing. I made my appointment and let them know i wanted my hair in layers and BLOW DRIED! I specifically made sure that they knew that i wanted it  blow dried. When I walked in, I was greeted and helped in a timely manner. It was my first time there so I accepted any stylist that was available. Jeremy was available and styled my hair. He cut and layered my hair nicely. He was a little slow but I didn't have complaints about the cut. So when it came to drying me hair he started to grab the flat iron. I told him nicely I don't like my hair flat iron bc I hate my hair being flat. He told me he doesn't blow dry bc of his wrist. Possible carpal tunnel. It's understandable but I wish they would have made that clear when I made my appointment or when I got there. There were other stylist available  when I waited  for him. So i wish somebody who was able to blow dry would have done my hair. I had no other option but to have my hair flat ironed. Obviously, I wasn't  happy w the end result as it was flat as a board. I had to use their curling iron and fix it myself in the salon. But once it's flat ironed there is no going back. So be specific and make sure u let them know when you get there what and how you want your hair done. Good luck!
3;"Out of town family is visiting.  You don't know where to take them. \n\nThe Dish is by far the best option. It is Southern, home style, everyone will find something on the menu and the atmosphere is relaxed. \n\nI absolutely love their grilled cheese and tomato soup (best tomato soup besides Trader Joe's tomato and roasted red pepper). They also have really good quesadilla's (or \""Mexican pizza\"" as my brother in law calls it). Everyone loves their Cajun meatloaf. \nAnd, always, the deviled egg.\n\nThere is usually local art on the walls. There is outdoor seating.\n\nThey do have a breakfast (I think Saturday). HOLY CRAP it is fatty, but really delicious (there is some sort of hash brown casserole that is INSANE)\n\nI don't go here on a regular basis. I think I would easily gain 20 lbs if I did. If you are hankering home cooked food though- this is the place to go.\n\nI have noticed that the Dish has been a little inconsistent over the pass few years. I remember in 2005 it was ALWAYS GOOD. I guess that happens over time."
4;Even though I have done my own taxes and taxes for others for many years, we had a special situation come up this year that required a deeper knowledge than I possess. I met with Wanda and really felt comfortable with her assessment of our situation and recommendations. I didn't feel rushed and we sat in her office and discussed the matter until I felt comfortable with our plan. I cannot recommend Wanda highly enough!
1;i like browsing thru bookmans, they collected alot of oldies and goodies from old vinyl records to cd's..etc...the only problem i have with bookmans is there trade-ins\ni understand they need to make a profit and trust me they do make  alot of profit but getting a few bucks when you know they sell it for 10x more than what they gave you i was angry!! heres an example i was watching a kid and his mom turn in a ps2 and couple games, would you believe the pretty much gave them a few lousy dollars or store credit?? like WTF? the mom was shocked and ofcourse the kid didn't no any better, the mom was trying to convince her kid to go somewhere else but the kid ofcourse thru his fit cause he wanted money to go and buy a ps3 go figure...anyways so i can only imagine how many people they have ripped off, sure they didn't have to sell it to them but cmon be fair about it
4;Great place to eat berry fair price food very tasty try the ribeye great and the pig in potato patch ......
4;we just cant get enough of jason's deli!!\ntheir beef eater has soooo much meat on it, that i only order half with their amzing salad bar!!\nsalad bar is sooooooo fresh and has everything imaginable!!\npastrami sandwich is amazing and order half unless your really hungry!!\neven humus, chocolate muisse, pudding and slef-serve ice-cream!!\nyou won't go away hungry!!\nwe eat there more then once monthly and luv it!!!\nhealthy to boot when you eat their salad!!\nsandy :)
4;Soft, made to order bagels. Great low-fat smoothies. Staff is always nice and patient with my gazillion order changes. There's so many great choices! They also have texting sign-ups and I get free coffee and bagels with my orders all the time.
3;Had the Sir Loin here and it was really good. I love how the tender and juicy mean has that fine taste. I never had this kind of sirloin so I guess I am amazed by the taste of it. The rib here was also good, it was perfectly grilled.\n\nThey will even make you more comfortable on your first time by attending to all of your need. I left like I'm a queen when I was here. Yes, we were treated very well, that's how wonderful the experience I had in this place.\n\nGood food and Good Service.
0;"Tsoynamis are one of my favorite foods in the world. I'm lactose intolerant and love blizzards, so it's a match made in heaven. I go to Green a lot as I live nearby, and have never felt unwelcome there, so I had no reason to think I'd feel that way about their sister joint, Nami. So after a disappointing dinner at Nobou at Teeter House in downtown phx, bf and I were excited to turn our night around with dessert at Nami when we realized we were super close to it and it was still open (since Green would have been closed by the time we got there). Their hours posted indicate they close at 9:30pm on Fridays, and we arrived at 9:20 after calling to confirm they were still open. \n\nWe walked in, and there were a few groups of people sitting and leisurely enjoying their ice cream and baked goods. We walked up to the counter and bf knew what he wanted right away (s'mores tsoynami with pb added...SO good!). I, on the other hand, needed a minute to decide since they had a huge bakery case filled with things I never see at Green and wanted to try out, in addition to the full tsoynami menu. \n\nI asked a few questions, which the light-haired woman working there was happy to answer. She disappeared to make bf's tsoynami, though, and we were then met with an icy stare and complete annoyance by the dark-haired woman working there. I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, and hey, it's Friday night and she probably wanted to close up so she could go out. But it wasn't even 9:30, and she had zero interest in making this customer happy. \n\nI said I was debating between a cookie and a tsoynami, while she rolled her eyes and continued to tap her fingers on the counter. Her response, rather than a suggestion or recommendation for something to order, was, \""We close in five minutes.\"" Ok? I know that already? Why wouldn't you just try to hurry us along in a constructive way, rather than making me feel afraid to ask you any questions about your products?\n\nShe continued to sigh and look around, willing us to disappear, and honestly I wish we would have left right then. But we were starving, and I really wanted to enjoy one of their delicious looking treats. I decided in my head that I wanted a tsoynami, but I was way too afraid to have that lady actually prepare something for me as I was pretty sure she would spit in it, in addition to the length of time it would have taken to prepare which surely would have put us over her 5-minute limit. I said I'd take the cookie, to get us out of there sooner. We still had to wait another minute for bf's tsoynami to be finished, and felt her stare us down the whole time. Mind you, there are still parties of other customers at tables still lingering. We were definitely NOT responsible for keeping them open, but we sure were made to feel that way!\n\nI don't care how tasty your treats are, I would never EVER go back there...who wants to leave a dessert place with such a sour taste in their mouth? I will be getting all of my future tsoynamis at Green, where they never make me feel like I'm doing something wrong by asking questions or spending a minute debating between a few items."
2;The golf course itself was maintained well. The staff here are very courteous and friendly. The ponds are horrendous with buildup and flying bugs. The smell from several was very gross.
4;Been coming here for many years .. Main reason i keep coming is because the great  service , honesty  & reasonable pricing.
0;"Worst coffee establishment in Las Vegas. Do NOT waste your time. I've tried to give this place three chances to just simply provide a decent cup of coffee in a reasonable amount of time. I live right around the corner from this place, so I wanted nothing more than to save me the five minute drive to the nearest Starbucks and like this joint. But I'd drive 30 minutes just to avoid going here for coffee. \n\nThe first time I went there I waited 10 minutes in the drive through with zero cars infront of me. I peered inside the drive through window and the place was as empty as can be, so not sure why it took so long to get a below-average cup of coffee. The second time I went there the coffee wasn't good at all, but the atmosphere was at least clean and cozy inside. I appreciated that they featured local artists on the walls, which made me give it a third and final shot. The third time I tried to give the drive through one more shot and the coffee one more shot. I ordered a mocha and a coffee with cream. The coffee was so cold, colder than \""room temperature\"". I parked, went inside, and told the person at the register, Holly, the owner, and her response was literally \""oh you wanted this hot?\"". No, I'd prefer my coffee that you put the coffee sleeve around ice cold. Absolutely ridiculous. Worst coffee establishment in town."
4;I was a little weary after reading reviews, but the experience me and my fiance had here was nothing but awesome. I would consider this hotel 3 stars, contrary to other opinions. We got a great deal, the man who helped us, Nick, was really friendly and helpful. He even let us check in before 2. The rooms were clean, the bed was super comfy, and I didn't have a problem getting wifi on my iPhone. We had the most fun at the pool, and the beach-like entrance was pretty neat. We were able to walk around the block to the light rail, then spent the evening at mill ave. The breakfast buffet in the morning was definitely above average, and there was a server around filling and refilling coffee, so he gives you a receipt if you'd like to leave gratuity. I don't see anything wrong with that. But overall, we had a great one night getaway and would stay again.
4;My family has been using Dr. Burke for our pets since I was to young to remember. He has a great personality, is very knowledgeable and is great with the pets! His prices are fair and you can usually get an appointment within a week or sooner for emergencies. The offices are always clean, bright and the front desk staff is very friendly. We have brought Dogs, Cats and Birds to Dr. Burke.
2;Went here with friends to grab a few drinks.  The it was early and not that packed but grew as the night went on.  Pretty soon it was packed but service was good even with crowd and the prices were reasonable and they have a pretty good draft list.  A good place to get your drink on with a crowd of rowdy friends.
1;This place is awful.  Pricey and tiny portions, nothing we ordered tasted good let alone fresh, near was very dry and obviously freezer burned,  I honestly can say I couldn't tell what was the pork and what was the chicken, the gyozu had no flavor, the menus are a mess, it's like seven sheets of paper written in magic marker, with no description of the food, the rest is in Japanese, handy if you're Japanese but sucks to be you if you aren't. The server had no idea what was going on, stay away from this place please, try almost any other spot in China town, you'll have better luck
2;Lobsicle, a deep fried lobster tail on a stick with a slice of lemon and butter. Fatness and roughly 14 hot burning dollars in your mouth. Totally good and worth it if you're winning! \n\nFries were pretty generous for the price and they have free samples of their lobster ice cream! It was interesting but not my kind of thing.
2;"Ramen just sounds perfect after a weekend of binging in Vegas. The ramen was \""A-OK\"", I was not a huge fan of the noodles, the broth was good and they were kinda stingy with the pork. Monta was average compared to ramen places I have been to in the Los Angeles/Orange County area but I left content and ready for the drive home."
1;The pool is 5 stars. The Hole in the Wall has a great lunch menu. The restaurant has a great setting, is good for children & families. When we ate there for dinner tonight I was really disappointed.  It took so long for them to get our food out. My ribs were tough & my husbands steak was really undercooked. We won't be back for dinner.
3;"This was a great meal but with rushed service.  We had dinner on a weekday. My mother ordered the murg vindaloo \""Indian hot\"" and loved the level of spiciness.  I order the kadhai paneer medium. Now, my heart sinks when the waiter at an Indian restaurant asks how hot I want it.  (My standard answer is \""however the chef thinks it should be\"", but waiters never accept that answer.)  Where I live a customer is never asked, but it seems to be a standard question in smaller cities.  My dish turned out to be perfectly seasoned.\n\nMy only issue was how quickly we were rushed out.  The waiter was asking us about dessert before my mother had finished her entr\u00e9e.  We ordered dessert and it arrived--before my mother had finished her entr\u00e9e.  The check came lickety-split.  I'm not sure what the hurry was as we were there at an early hour."
3;We came to Vegas and stayed here for the first time.  \n\nPros:\n1. Elegant\n2. Modern\n3. Big rooms (We stayed in the suite)\n4. Close proximity to the casino and bars/restaurants\n5. Big bathrooms \n6. Great staff\n\nCons:\n1. The casino (Mandalay Bay) was pretty bright and intense.  I preferred the Luxor's laid back atmosphere much more, but the good thing is that the casinos are attached. \n2. They were a little slow with the housekeeping / room service\n\nOverall, a great place to stay.  We usually stay at the Venetian, but this place held its own for half the price. I am definitely staying here next time.
0;Don't expect good customer service unless your a mild age white person, or look like you just got off the course. Not once was I asked if I needed any help. -_-
4;"One of the best meals and best service we have had in a very long time. Shawn was a top notch server who was attentive, knowledgeable, and engaging.  We had drinks during happy hour (excellent bartender) then in to dinner with wife and son. Order the combination appetizer-very good. Then we had three different meals; all three were top notch. Desert and coffee topped off the perfect evening. Would definitely go back!"
4;I am so glad I finally stopped in to Pesto Prima before moving out of the neighborhood! I drive past it almost every day but was a little sketched out by its barren strip mall location.\n\nThe cafe itself is bright and clean. My mom and I were reading the chalkboard menu for a minute when a friendly, helpful cashier gave us brochure type menus to look at that were more detailed and had descriptions of the food items. Very nice! \n\nI read some other reviews saying that the ingredients are relatively basic and simple, but they are correct in that everything was very flavorful. We got an order of California Toast to share which was soo yummy! I usually don't like avocado but I could eat that toast every single day. I also got a small Berry Parfait and mom got the Prima Breakfast Sandwich. \n\nFor beverages I ordered an iced dirty vanilla chai latte, per the above mentioned friendly cashier's recommendation. It was probably one of the best chai lattes I've had in the area. Mom tried the Java Mocha Blast, which I thought was similar to D'lish's Breakfast Buzz, only 10x better.\n\nDon't let the odd location fool you, Pesto Prima is definitely a hidden gem :)
4;"If it is one thing I love more than a bookshop, it would need to be a charity bookshop. Some of my favourite reads have come from this shop and it is all thanks to the readers of Morningside & surrounding areas.\n\nSituated near the bottom of Morningside Road, this wonderful little charity shop that isn't much bigger than an average sized bedroom is home to some of the best organisational skills that l have ever come across. As you enter the shop you realise that your trip here is going to be a very easy and stress free one which can sometimes be the case when it comes to visiting new bookshops.\n\nThe staff here are very friendly & if you can't see the book you're looking for then feel free to ask one of the staff members that have always been happy enough to go and check for me. For you collectors out there, this Oxfam charity shop is also the beholder of a pretty impressive \""rare, old and signed\"" section which isn't even remotely called that but the books are there all the same.\n\nAlso for you \""comic geeks\"" there is a spectacular collection of comic issues and graphic novels.You'd think that would be enough but there is aIso a beautiful collection of CD's & vinyl's for you to browse through too. they have it all!\n\nAll in all this is probably the best charity shop in the Bruntsfield/Morningside area if you are wanting something new to read or are just wanting to spend an hour or so browsing through one of the many wonderful things this shop has to offer (there is another part to this Oxfam next door that sells just about anything else you can imagine). Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!"
1;From the store's name, I was expecting a nicer, upscale pet store filled with all sorts of pet goodies. But once inside, I was disappointed at the feel of the place & how little this place had in it.\n\nI know it's a pet friendly place, so I can't hark too much on the smell & marks left on the carpet from doggie messes. But it seems like flooring that doesn't soak up every liquid that touches it would be appropriate in a pet friendly place. Anyways, the store really didn't feel that inviting to me, there were different sections/stands of items throughout this small store, & things really seemed just scattered around randomly.\n\nAnd the selection they do have really wasn't all that impressive. They have everything from treats & toys, to leashes & clothing, but not a big selection in any of these areas. I was also expecting more unique items considering this is a specialty store, but they have anything you could find in your local Petsmart.\n\nUrban Pet has a good idea, but just needs a better, more unique selection of items that you don't readily find in your large pet stores. Nothing really jumped out at me about this place & as a dog lover, I didn't see anything here that I was really intrigued by.
4;Friendly service, good ice cream. Those of you that haven't been here yet here's the deal- You pick your base, either custard, yogurt, etc depending how much fat % you want, then flavor, then mix ins/toppings.
0;Not a good meal - just a nasty pile of ingredients, including way too much spinach and chicken that was basically bad quality. The girls behind counter take the stuff and grill it for like 45 seconds (not even hot) and then dump all the stuff into a plastic container and douse it with a ton of dressing. All of that gets mixed up and dumped into a cold pita and then twisted and ready to eat or in my case - ready for the garbage can. i thought there were good deals at student dining places, but this place is just like a mall food court, no deals in sight.
3;I wish I would have found this place sooner. It was a welcome surprise to find. Being a Louisiana native now living in Pittsburgh, you rarely find any cajun food anywhere and if you do, it's not what it should be. \n\nEverything I had was delicious, the chef was more than helpful with preparing an item I had requested and then just went ahead with making the entire meal an amazingly delicious experience that reminded me of home. \n\nThe bartender did make the oddest version of a Hurricane I had ever had. I don't think that particular person knew what they were doing, but my review is for the food, not the bar. \n\nMy only other complaint, would be that the waitress didn't seem to know much about the food. She served my husband and I a tasting of etouffee, but never brought the rice to go with it and had not come back to check on us so we just had a few bites of it by itself. It was good, just not served properly. Being in the service industry myself, it really makes me a lil picky about how I get treated when I dine out, and I was turned off that a place this unique to this area, where especially most people here don't know this type of food, should have servers who know what they are serving.
0;When to Home Depot to buy a replacement hot water heater and when I asked about installation price I was told $550.00 compared to $250 to $350 with every article I read on the web. What was worse, I was told I was paying for a quality installer. End of the story, I went to Lowes and found a similar hot water heater and their contractor and installation price ($275.00) were both aligned with my expectations. I'll still shop at Home Depot but will always check out thier contractors.
2;The bottled beer is by far the best thing on the menu. The draft beers are pretty good, but not great. Do not go here for food.
4;Great! You'll eat until you hurt. We go out of our way to eat here each time we are in Vegas. Get Ruben and chicken noodle soup.
2;"Perhaps they are still working out the kinks, the place has potential.  \n\nFor dinner we ordered mussels, two pasta dishes and a bottle of wine for $100.  Overall the food was good, nothing spectacular.  We went on a Friday evening and with a full house, the place was pretty noisy such that my fiance felt like he was shouting at me.  We are really excited to have them in the neighborhood and hope they get everything worked out soon.\n\nSo first, our orders were messed up, we got the wrong mussels (Horseradish instead of bacon blue cheese) and as it turns out, the Horseradish mussels were not good. I'm known to protect mussel broth from being cleared until every last bit is sopped up into crusty french bread, and this recipe allowed the bread to stay put in the basket.  When we asked about it because we tasted no bacon, the waiter said, \""oh yes, that's right you did order the bacon ones.  Do you want that taken off your bill?\""  Awkward....\n\nSecond,   we ordered pasta dishes and the waiter made a point of recommending linguine, which was fine because pasta shapes weren't listed on the menu and we never would have thought of requesting a particular one.  What made this strange was that when we asked him about it when both our dishes came out wrong, he told us the kitchen was serving whatever pasta they could put out quickest and was that okay with us.  Oh, you linguine tease, you!\n\nSo, to wrap up, nothing that can't be fixed and the place will be a great addition to the neighborhood."
0;I have eaten here two times. Once back in 2006(food was average) and again not too long ago. I have to say that the quality of the sushi is some of the worst that I have had. Fish did not taste fresh, poor sake selection, and the rolls were terrible. I'm guessing the only thing to eat in this restaurant is the teppan style cooking.. I haven't tried it yet, but you have to try REALLY hard to screw that up. I wouldn't bother with this establishment when there are so many other great restaurants in Vegas. I'll save my tepanyaki cravings for when I'm back in good ol' Miami.
2;It was the little sisters birthday. The parental units love the place, we had 24 people to feed its about $12 a person for dinner. This place worked and it had the seating space for everyone. The food is ok to good. Depends on what your eating. They have quite the variety and its kept fresh. Plates were cleared from the table quick. Beverages were always filled. Host and waitress were friendly with smiles.
1;The tacos were too greasy the pizza was on cardboard and the wings kicked my a**.  If you like really hot wings this is the place to go.  Honestly they taste good too.  I have had lots of hot wings and love hot food but the extra hot at Zipps is INTENSE.  That would be the only reason I would so to go.
0;UGH!\n\nUtter Disgust.\n\nI recently moved to the Phoenix/West Valley area and as I'm driving around, looking for somewhere to eat, I see this hole-in-the-wall mexican drive-thru on the side of the road. Most of the best mexican food is found in some of the dirtiest, grimiest spots so I was all for tryin this place out... so I pull into the drive-thru and theres a guy standing outside, next to the menu, just staring at me. It takes me a minute to realize that he's going to be taking my order. That shoulda been a red flag but I ignored it, ordered my food and pulled up to the window. Waited a good 20 minutes... grrreeeeaaaat...... finally get my food (carne asada burrito & adobada fries) and I drive home. By the time I get home (about 10 minutes away), I pick  up my bag and theres a PUDDLE of grease sitting at the bottom of the bag. It literally had to be about 3/4 to a full CUP of grease!! SO GROSS! But i'm STARVING and i'm definitely not going to drive all the way back. So, I get rid of as much grease as possible and I eat the food. I had the fries. My wife had the burrito. Aside from the grease bomb that had exploded on my meal, I guess the food wasnt TOO horrible. Definitely not as good at Federico's or Filiberto's... but not HORRIBLE...\n\nThe next day, at work, I get this INTENSE stomach pain and knots in my belly. I end up having to leave work early because it hurts so bad. I ended up vomiting VIOLENTLY for the next 24 hours. \n\nNEVER AGAIN!
2;The food here was pretty decent, on par with Bellagio. However, they lacked some of the diversity of the other hotels. They did offer cotton candy, which was a little bizarre as I took it from them, but it was actually fun. Overall, I would recommend it despite it's lack of diversity based upon its quality.
1;"The wife and I moved near this place a couple of years ago and thought this could be our hot spot for BBQ...  Boy were we wrong.\n\nOur first trip we had \""ok\"" service on a weekday and like Jake B. our food seemed to be re-heated from the weekend before.  I had a combo to try out the different options and was less than impressed. \n\nI even gave them a second shot just in case the first trip was a fluke.  I had the same results when ordering the ribs on our second visit.\n\nI really wish this place was good ....  guess I will have to drive to Joe's Real BBQ in Gilbert to get some damn good BBQ."
2;"Ok Mexican like everywhere else. I completely agree with the previous reviewer, \""when is the authentic one coming to this town?\"" The menu cover page says it's authentic, but the men items themselves looked little more tex-mex ish. I had a fajita plate while my friend had a chicken dish (I forgot what it was called). My fajita arrived on a sizzling hot plate (that's takes care of the \""fun part\"" regardless of the quality), and it was pretty good. The portion was huge, so I had to take ha;f of my plate to go, and the take out became the perfect left-over dinner next day."
3;Went here Friday night with some friends. We had the dragon roll, a king kong roll, and a crunchy spicy tuna roll. They were very good, especially the dragon roll, but that may be I'm partial to dragon rolls. The albacore was totally awesome, and I really liked the fresh water eel. Tried a few other sushi and all were good. \nThey were moderately busy and service was nice and friendly, I got plenty of iced green tea. Overall we had a good time and plan to return to try one of the all you can eat sushi nights.
0;I come here a lot. And by a lot I mean once ever 2-3 months. I've always a great experience until this time. I ordered my usual  steak classique well done with pur\u00e9e. My steak came and it was medium rare. I kindly asked my server if they could take it back and fix it and they did. But this time my steak was just rare. My mother ordered the chicken p\u00e2t\u00e9 and she wasn't please with it so she order the same thing as me and her steak was rare as well. One of the worst experiences I've had at this establishment. I don't think I will be returning anytime soon.
4;I love everyone at this dealership! I mean that 100%!! From the moment I brought my car in for service, they made me feel like I was part of their family. I was new to the area and they were so helpful in giving directions and making sure I was comfortable with them and the service team. \n\nI had my keys to my car stolen and had to have my car completely re-keyed. I could not believe how much that Brett and his team did to make sure everything went smoothly! I had an awesome loaner car and it was ready when I drove in to drop my car off. Brett followed up with me daily on the progress and my car was CLEAN & ready when they told me it would be! Also, the price quoted was the price it was! No extra charges (that can happen with some dealerships). Dropping off the rental and picking up my car was fast and easy!! I loved the service from the service department so much, when it was time to lease a new Audi, I went to them.\n\nTODAY I LEASED A NEW Audi A4 Quarto! I LOVE IT!! The Sales Manager, Brian Parvin is AMAZING! He really worked the numbers for me so that I was exactly where I wanted to be. He didn't try to oversell me and treated me like a valuable Audi customer and a human being. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME!! I worked in the auto industry for 7 years...I know good service and GREAT SERVICE & SALES!\n\nThe lease manager was so nice and she didn't try to sell me on tons of extra packages I did not need. She advised me of what I did need or should get and was a pleasure to work with!\n\nI know my next Audi will be coming from here!! Seriously, the best Audi team in Vegas and probably the West Coast!!\n\nI also have to say that the dealership itself is stunning, clean and not stuffy or like a traditional car dealership! It is relaxed and fun! Everyone is so nice and what is better than looking at Audi's all day?! :-)\n\nThey made turning in my previous Audi simple and easy and had my car clean, gassed up and ready to go in no-time. \n\nIf you are going to buy an Audi, or already own an Audi and looking to have a great service department service it, Audi Henderson is the dealership to go to!!
0;Yes the hotel is nice and clean but this one star review is for how greedy they are.  You have to use a ice bucket to keep your drinks cold.  Yes they do have a fridge but it's completely full with there extremely overpriced drinks all on sensors.   You move it you get charged.  And the sign says it's for my convenience.   How is going down the long hall to get ice convenient to me?  Paying a couple hundred dollars a night you should be able to use part of the fridge.   Next time we are staying on Fremont Street.  Drinks and food is 1/4 the cost.
2;"It was an \""OK\"" experience. more expensive then some of the classier places on the first floor. They offer a free photo and but it's a sales pitch to try and get you to buy the bigger and better pictures. The store offers you a rewards program and when you say yes, they tell you it's actually a credit card... and we don't have any of these restaurants around us so no thanks!"
4;Holy hell! Just had the best massage of my life today with Eric! I was extremely relaxed and comfortable as he worked his magic on my aching body. He has super prices- he's in an extremely convenient location- he can come to you- and he does an absolutely amazing job! I've already booked my next appointment!!
2;Linguine and clams is good, better  than Oyster Bar. My husband's order kinda ruined, he ordered, Rib Eye Steak with veggies but when he asked for steak sauce, they don't have it. You don't serve Steak without  steak sauce, especially when it really needed.
4;Had a 10 person band play, with all kinds of different instruments last night. The band was truly amazing and played such a wide variety of up best music. Kiss FM was also there and offered $.01 drinks, so our table got a free round!\n\nThere was probably 80 beers on tap, had the big blue van beer and it was delicious. Never heard of a lot of the beers, but have so many local beers to try!
0;This guys a crook !
2;"We have been here twice, and I am not very impressed with the service. I'm definitely over the skinny girls dressed like floozies; it seems to be like that in every bar now; if you are sexy naked, you are sexy dressed. \n\nThe first time we came here was a Sunday morning waiting for a biker run. The service was good, the burger was good. They were slow, so I didn't have much to complain about. \n\nThe other night we went here for wings and beer. I had to ask to have the bar cleaned. It was about 9:30 pm and they had a crowd, but they weren't overly busy. We had to ask for menus. I ordered a beer and it seemed really large, but I went with it. We ordered wings and a sandwich. They were ok, nothing I couldn't live without again. The wings did have more meat on them then some of the other places I have been. Next, I had to ask for another beer, and I had to ask if there was a smaller size. The small is really small. Dave never even got another drink because she never asked, and he did want one.\n\nThe one positive note I will say - I couldn't decide what to drink, so she gave me a sample of a couple of beers and then suggested something based on the feedback I had on the beer samples. One extra star for that suggestion, and attention. \n\nWe probably would have had a better experience if our server was more attentive and we would have spent more money on booze - but we just ate and left. \n\nNot sure if we will go back again or not."
0;Very disorganized. Hard to get anyone to call you back within a reasonable time frame. Never again.
4;I've been resisting going to this place for the past several years. The location was previously an 'all you can eat' place called Yummy Buffet.  It's illogical why I resisted.\n\nI went here recently and ordered the cold chicken, eggplant dish, and fried chicken.  Everything tasted amazing, but in particular, I want to say, be open to the cold chicken dish - the briny sauce it was smothered in was a heavenly combination of sweet, tangy, and salty.\n\nI'm definitely coming back here again.  Three dishes came out to $30 or so for two people.  You could also go cheaper and order the lunch bentos.
3;Very clean, everyone from receptionist to the waxer is very nice. Ad prices are way cheaper than other waxing places.
1;Below average food experience for me and good for my GF. I took my breakfast sandwich back after it was more lettuce than substance and was just not good at all and it was replaced with a weak, unflavorful helping of the omlette special. Very underwhelming food. Young wait staff was unorganized and slow. But were very friendly. Check it off the list. Over rated in my opinion. Marigold, Bluefies, Hubbard Ave are WAY better in all areas. Especially, in the overall food quality, consistency catagory.
4;"Great italian food.  Fresh, home made pasta.  Great Pizzas.  Real italian flavor, not americanized.  One of the best pizza places I've been to in the country.\n\nAlso worth noting that this restaurant is actually an old home that was re-purposed.  The have several rooms inside which each accommodate an individual group.  However, when the weather is nice, the \""front yard\"" is the place to enjoy your wonderful meal."
3;This place is simply great. The steak is excellently flavored, the wait staff are all helpful and very good. The atmosphere of this place is unique as well, as the restaurant is in the oldest building in Tempe. From the outside it looks pretty small, but once inside you will see that it is huge. If you are looking for a GREAT meal that won't bust your wallet, come to Monti's - it is definitely worth it.
3;"I was a little confused as I walked up to Cotterell Lighting store in the Newington area. I was presented with what appeared to be a beautiful old church but the \""Sale now on\"" said something different. Then, I noticed the huge signs for \""Cotterell Lighting\"" and I decided to pop in. I was still really confused and wondered if I was entering some kind of bizarre lighting cult.\n\nAs soon as I entered I realised that it was indeed a shop, and it sold lighting, all kinds of lighting, in every design you could think of. There were two friendly staff members working who just told me to give them a shout if I needed any help so I decided to browse. I couldn't believe how many different lighting styles they had and if you're looking for a new lampshade or light then you will find exactly what you're looking for here. In addition to lighting they also do a small amount of furniture.\n\nI noticed a really cool mirror ball light, a lampshade on a stand that was designed to look like a fish bone and a huge mirror that I like instantly as it made me look better than I actually do.\n\nI have to admit, it was a little odd walking around an old church and it was pretty much intact apart from the missing pews. When I looked up I could see that the upper seating of the church was still there and if that area was still accessible you could have taken a seat and looked down at the now lighting shop. The creaking floor boards were still there as were the stained glass window and painted high ceiling. It seems a waste that such a beautiful church is now just a shop and even stranger that it hasn't been disguised as a shop.\n\nI'd recommend visiting under the guise that you need a new lightbulb, as it really is an experience."
1;Good chicken sandwich and burgers.......but I will never wait an hour for lunch again. I would understand if the place was packed, but four tables were seated when we arrived. Again, good food but expect a long wait.
4;This place is awesome!!!  Regardless if you like sushi or not you need to give this place a try, though a plus if you already love sushi.  I've been to severeal sushi places all over the country and this place by far as the most unique and appitizing menu available.\n\nAs the name states, CowFish is a sushi bar specializing in both seasfood and meat sushi both raw and cooked.  Their menu features many standard sushi combinations as well as many new and interesting items too.  As well there is a large buger and other sandwich menu for those who enjoy their food cooked.\n\nI'd definately recommend getting reservations as the place was packed at 8pm on a Wednesday, but luckily I got the last available bar stool.  The drink prices are typical for the area and the food is on the higher priced side, but well worth it.\n\nTwo things you must try are the Filet Minion sushi roll and one of the (3) sushi burgers which feature a bun made of sushi rice and such.
0;Used to love this place but they unexpectedly closed their doors yesterday and cancelled our reservation for next month. Really tacky!
3;This place is great!  Awesome neighborhood spot. Great Thai food at really reasonable prices. The only reason this place gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because sometimes the food can be just a touch oily for my liking.  They listen really well and always get the spiciness right which both my fiancee and I appreciate as he loves spicy spicy food and I am more of a medium spicy girl. \n\nFavorites: Thom Kha Soup with chicken and Spicy Cashew Chicken.
0;"First Yelp review I've ever left. Because service here was AWFUL. Before here, I had went to Verizon. They told me to come to an Apple store. The Apple store told me in 10 minutes I'd have an appointment with their \""Geniuses\"", and I had to wait for like 30 minutes. Then, when I saw the stupid \""Genius\"" (who was a DUMBASS), he just told me that I'd need to pay to replace my phone, and that it could not be fixed. The GENIUS claimed my phone had water damage and was very rude to me when I insisted it did not - he said he'd \""repeat the question\"" again about the water damage, which I still insisted I had no knowledge of it having. I went back to Verizon and they simply plugged it in, and restarted it, and the phone turned on and was working fine. Verizon said the phone didn't appear to have any problems and was confused about why the Apple Genius would have told me such things. I almost paid $200 to get another phone! In addition, the Apple GENIUS claimed my phone wasn't even registered to me, it was registered to someone in Texas! I've had this phone a year! At Verizon they checked it, via my ACCOUNT, and said the serial number is registered to me! TERRIBLE experience."
1;We were excited to come to this Mongolian grill suggested by family.\n\nFirst of all, we visited on a Friday night. This location is in the Tempe Marketplace, an outdoor mall. Parking was horrible, and that is not the fault of the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant wasn't too busy, and the hostess quickly seated our group. Something had apparently spilled on the floor near the bar long before we arrived and we all walked through it. The service and customers had spread whatever was spilled in a sticky mess all throughout the restaurant. Gross.\n\nTo top that, the first table we sat at was also sticky, and before the waitress came back, we had found ourselves a new table.\n\nThere is quite a selection of meats and veggies, this was a plus. However, the selection of sauces, while extensive, is completely (almost?) sugar-based. It would be nice to have had some options that were lower calorie or lower glycemic index. Even just oil and soy sauce would have been nice.\n\nThe service came around often, however she never checked to see what everyone needed before darted off to get one person's drink., which resulted in her needing to make many more trips.\n\nOverall the food was really just so-so, and the fresh meat that others describe was actually frozen when we made our bowls.
2;Recently ate dinner there had a wonderful sushi option the North Hills Roll. Just wish it weren't so expensive or I would go more often.
4;As far as I know, this is the only place in town that specializes in Mexican ice cream and desserts (some snack food too, like spicy fruit, esquites, tortas, duros). It is nice to be able to have access to these treats out here in the Midwest! I've only had the paletas here so far, and they're great, and there are dozens of flavors of helado and paletas to choose from. I'll definitely come back to try other menu items.  I think it's a bit expensive (probably because I'm comparing it to the prices I'm used to paying for the same things in LA) but it's comparable to the prices at other ice cream and dessert places in the C-U area, and it makes sense given that it's the only place that sells some of the menu items. There is plenty of indoor seating, and it seems like a good place to go with friends or family.
2;"5/10/12\n\nFinally made my first visit today.  Funny- I told the greeter that I'd been waiting to try Perk for years, yet I added the bookmark just last year.  May 8, 2011, to be exact.  Anyhoo, the restaurant looked better than a roadstop diner- a lot better.  After reading a few reviews, I was expecting worse.  There were actually some nice pieces of wall art.  Overall, I liked the energy inside, even though there were only two or three other diners present at the time.  \n\nSince I'd already checked out the menu online, I had two choices in mind to try (French toast or pancakes), which would depend on what the daily/weekly special was, and what the \""nut\"" was in their caramelized banana nut topping for the pancakes, French toast, and waffles.  Since the special \""for a few days\"" was Pumpkin pecan pancakes and pecans were the only nuts on hand, and I've a pecan allergy, I was reduced down to the fresh berries topping, and so I ordered the French toast combo, with soft-scrambled eggs, spicy chorizo ($7.99 menu price) and a cappuccino ($2.99).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Xs2iTWxbczvfEapAFH3cyw?select=U_9TbY3TyP4eFbaeCe9RSQ#U_9TbY3TyP4eFbaeCe9RSQ\n\nWas excited to try another organic eatery since there are only a few in town, but I'm a bit disappointed on this first visit to Perk Eatery.  The eggs were fine, and the spicy chorizo complemented them well.  (The salt in the chorizo created a nice balance with the unseasoned eggs!)  The French toast had a nice crisp to them and were not at all greasy, but I guess I was just expecting more.  It didn't have enough custard for me, and I suppose I'm used to a little bit more decadence... mascarpone cream, caramel, creme fraiche, or just plain butter, even.  At least the pancake syrup was 100% maple.  (Can't recall if it's organic, though.)  The eggs served here are local Hickman Farms cage-free, so that's a plus.  Would love to see this updated to organic in the future.  The cappuccino was made with organic Passport coffee, and it was good, but I'm not used to seeing such a stark white froth, and so thick!  No matter- I got over it  quickly.  :)\n\nRestaurant and women's restroom were clean and organized.  Service was friendly, and I liked the frequency in which Daniel and other employees (owner/managers?) came by to check up on things.  I thought it cool that someone (he struck me as a manager, or co-manager) handed me another napkin just a couple of seconds after maple syrup dripped from my plate onto the napkin on my lap.  Good eye!  While the French toast was, to me, underwhelming, it hasn't stopped me from following Perk Eatery on Twitter to try the Lemon-ricotta pancakes when they're on special.\n\nNote to Perk: Please update your breakfast menus to reflect the price change of the French toast combo.  A $2 upcharge for a one-person ticket is no big deal, especially if everything on the menu is organic, but I don't know if I'd be as nonchalant about it if I brought in a larger party and the ticket reflected a higher discrepancy..."
4;mind. EXPLOSION.\n\ni had the grilled chicken sandwich! it even had some potatoes in there. BREAD IS AMAZING. next time, gonna get involved with some STEAK.\n\nmy friend got the corn on the cob and it looked so legit. he wouldnt even share.\n\nI DREAM OF THIS TYPE OF FOOD
4;oh wow, this place is amazing! It's like a modern Cracker Barrell (no offense, I like Cracker Barrell) however, this place had a younger, more hip twist to it. Pet friendly patio, picnic benches in the back, and complimentary valet. I could get used to this!
4;I think that from the previous reviews this bike shop has gotten a bad rap.  I, from reading the comments, was hesitant on going to the shop but was interested in Specialized bike and being a beginner/entry level rider had lots of questions.  I decided I'd give them a try.  I went in and seen lots of different bikes and was somewhat overwhelmed.  I was approached after a few minutes and asked if I needed any help or had any questions.  Boy, this young man didn't know I had a million questions. He was very happy and patient and answered all of my questions and even offered up several different bikes, and not the more expensive ones, but ones that would fit my budget.  He was more than happy to talk to me about the bikes and increased my knowledge of the road bike arena.  I asked for his business card and told him I'd call again and stop by next week.\nWell, the bike that I wanted was there and was reduced in price, but having to work all weekend and all day long, I wasn't able to get to the shop during shop hours.  I did call them and asked several more questions and the gentlemen that I spoke with this time were just as helpful, patient and courteous.  I'm convinced that if they treat me this way when I'm looking and haven't bought yet, than I'm really feeling confident that the customer service will be just as great.\nI think that you are doing a injustice to yourself and the business if you don't afford them the opportunity to earn your business.
3;I agree with the review that said this is a blessing for breakfast in Vegas.  Especially with the smokey air make your throat hurt and lose your voice.  The workers were very helpful and altered a smoothie that was all fruit.
3;Good place to get a good cheap meal.
2;The food is actually pretty good, as far as flavoring is concerned... but they're always so crowded (due to their location) they hardly pay proper attention to cook times. So it's a tossup... you can either get your meal done perfectly, or so overcooked, it's totally tasteless... unacceptable for a supposedly good restaurant.
4;Awesome food and service!\n\nMy wife, son and I visited the fun staff @ hokaido and were immediately greeted as if we were regulars. We got two of the lunch box specials and a shared order of the Butter Nipple rolls, and wow, were they superb! Our server Stephanie was very outgoing, extremely friendly and understanding of our lack of knowledge for sushi. She was very knowledgeable about the menu, gave us great choices, and was a great tour guide on our experience at Hokaido. We will definitely be back!
2;In my ongoing struggle to find truly good Vietnamese food in Las Vegas, I finally made it out to the supposed best sandwich shop around. I ordered the Banh Mi Dac Biet (house special) and the Banh Mi Thit Nuong (grilled pork). Both were $3.25.\n\nI ate the Thit Nuong on the night of purchase, and I saved the Dac Biet tonight. The latter held up nicely after a quick toast in the oven, which is a pretty standard result.\n\nI won't really go into too much detail on the sandwiches. The components taste nice and seem fresh, but I don't think there's enough meat, pickled veggies, cilantro, or even jalapeno. In other words, it's kinda like Subway but with fewer veggies. The overall result, unfortunately, is that the sandwiches are not very filling, and they leave you with bread as the main after-flavor.\n\nMaybe I'll check out some of the pate chaud or banh bao on the counters if I'm ever in the area again. Otherwise, I'm going to wait for something good from California (and no, Lee's Sandwiches does not count).
3;Very, very good. Service both at the bar and table was impeccable. Our server knew the menu very well and made excellent suggestions. Their unique cocktails were excellent and a decent price for a decent pour. We enjoyed the noshing board to start and then had the cheesy grits with sausage at our server's suggestion and we loved it. We also had a side of roasted shishito peppers which was a special on the menu that night and it was also excellent. We ended with the chocolate dipped bacon s'mores which were so unique but actually quite delicious. \n\nI will definitely be coming back here to try more things from the menu.
1;"Just ok.  Quite pricy.  $8.95 for a bowl of Pho.  I paid the extra $2 for more meat and really, was surprised at the lack of brisket and flank steak.  Would have considered that a \""regular\"" order not the extra.  Clean place, fast service.  I was one of the first customers seated at 1130.  By noon there was a line out the door.    Got the fried spring rolls for $5.95.  Very dry and gummy.  Definately not the greatest."
1;First time we wanted to dine here, there was a 30 minute wait. We were too hungry so we left but anticipated our return since there were so many good reviews on here.\n\nI hate to say our experience did not live up to expectations..\n\nWe sat at the bar for all you can eat. The sushi chefs didn't talk much at all, and the waiter was pretty slow in refilling drinks. Mine was empty for 5 minutes before they came to refill it.\n\nI was enjoying my calamari and my Volcano Roll. I then ordered a deep-fried roll which I had never tried before, and stopped when I pulled a long hair out of a piece of my sushi. I completely lost my appetite and won't be returning. I really don't see what the hype is about, we've had 200% better experiences at I Love Sushi.
2;I read the yelp reviews and had high expectations. Great social setting and really good ambiance. Nice selection of margaritas  which is a must for a good Mexican restaurant. The claimed house special is pork shoulder. Unfortunately, I came away disappointed. It was dry from the long smoke which means the meat was not wrapped or injected. Apps were good to very good and the guac was very good. Nice blend of jalape\u00f1os, Serrano and chipotle pur\u00e9e. Overpriced but at least every dish is made to order.
4;Found this place on yelp and it was perfect for what I needed, which was 2 battery watches replaced. They were fixed within ten minutes and he also straigten out my crooked sunglasses. Very sweet man, his name is Grant
0;"First and last stay here.....\n\nWow, thats what came to my mind when I walked into our room. I have been going to the Harrah's in Rincon (California for a few years now love the rooms same property but not the same maintenance. It was my frst time ever in vegas now that I'm over the age of 21 I was excited we were in town to see a concert and just have fun. The room looked nice, except for the toilet's non stop running, when we tried to flush it it was stuck. So we called front desk they sent over someone and hour later and a part later it was fine but hardly flushed, whatever at least the running stopped. I look out our window and the pool looked like a hurricane tore it apart. Being in vegas you want to drink by the pool. I called the front desk they said \""Oh our pool isn't working right now it's closed till further notice\"", Seriously?\n\nMy friends and I tried to let it go so we went out for drinks, at the Toby Keith Bar (FIVE STARS for sure there) did some gambling (The dealers were amazing and nice) Came back two hours before our show to shower, the lights hardly turned on in the bathroom a bulb was starting to go. We showered, the shower leaked, soaked our clothes that was on the floor. It was a mess, I was very disappointed. I am the type who doesn't care where we stay as long as it's nice, and functioning. Yeah, no never again will I stay here.\n\nAll around I can say the staff was amazing and sweet the hotel needs a lot of work. I understand it's vegas but come on!"
0;1 star mostly for the concept of all u can drink bloody marys and mimosas at brunch.  Too bad we couldn't stand to hang out any longer to get close to $18 worth, each...  Thanks for trying to make one Jane, but it wasn't any good.\n\nThis place is a joke.  Food was poorly executed, especially since we were in an empty dining room, listening to musac.  Poahed eggs were hard as rocks and the omelet was rubbery and dry.  $72 for brunch.\n\nOwner/ manager walking around with a bloody mary in his hand (I guess I would be getting drunk too if my business was failing), instead of paying attention to his surroundings.  I think they pay more in linen for the dining room then they do their kitchen staff.\n\nMy Louisiana girlfriend is embarrassed that this place even exists..:
4;"Why I feel the need to update my review on Bianco is beyond me, but after tonight I ended up more impressed and, even more satisfied with every visit.\n\nThis place is amazing, absolutely amazing... so humble yet so in tune with the kitchen and customers it would blow an entire 15 mile radius of chains out of business, if it hasn't already. \n\nI've looked over the reviews and the number one thing people seem to have an issue with is the wait time. \n\nAll I can say is, don't go here hungry or in a HURRY, and for god's sake go near CLOSING time if you really want to indulge here, who the hell really wants to wait 2+ hours for dinner at PRIME hour, I sure as hell don't!!! \n\nAnother issue I've noticed is that the staff is \""snotty, hipster or too cool for themselves\"".\n\nNot true at all, c'mon now people...You can't take your \""I'M ENTITLED TO EVERYTHING AT THIS MINUTE\"" attitude to a restaurant with one man in the kitchen, go to Chili's if your in such a hurry and save us all real foodies the headache and best produce :) \n\nKudos Bianco!"
4;"If you want to know about consistency for any business, here's my recent experience\n\nOnce again, Miles and Ronald at GYMO did a wonderful job moving all my stuff!  *hugs and high fives*  Ryan was a good man in following up to make sure we're on the same page for the scheduled moving date.  It rained so badly on 08/12 we had to reschedule, none of the guys would get hurt slipping and hurting themselves in the process and no extra charge for me; a nice midweek win-win.\n\nThey arrived the next day on time.  after everything was done, the glass items stayed intact the way I packed them, Ronald took good care of my TV, Miles was a very efficient un-loader, the things I needed to unpack was in a very logical order; perhaps he knows the way a tomboyish lady like me think...impressive!\n\nI unpacked all my stuff in two days moving into a 2 bedroom apartment (I don't know if that's the national average, but I beat last year's record from four days someone needs to take a poll on that one; I guess I hate moving day clutter )."
0;Made reservations here a couple of months ago since I was going to attend the UFC expo. Instead of checking in on Thursday, we checked in on Friday at about 12:30am. Unfortunately, they had no more rooms in the Ipanema Tower. Which is the tower that I preferred to stay in since the rooms are a bit newer and cleaner than the ones in the Masquerade Tower. They only had rooms available on the pet friendly floor which was located in the Masquerade Tower. So I was stuck with that room and even though I told them that my bf and I have very bad allergies to animal fur!!! They couldn't do anything to get us a different room.\n\nSo we were stuck there for one night and were informed that we can change rooms the following morning at 11am. But since I was going to head to the expo at 9:30am I wouldn't be able to do so. I asked them if they can just hold a room for us since we wont be back until late evening since the expo ends at 6pm. I was then told that the latest would be 7pm but then again with the traffic coming back to Rio from mandalay bay, I was not sure that we would make it back in time. So I asked if they can hold the room until 9pm and they couldn't do so. The latest was 7pm. GRRR..\nI don't understand why they couldn't just hold a room for us since I made reservations or at least check me into a room without having me to be there physically! I could have picked up my card keys after I came back from the expo. But NO! because of this I had to leave the expo early and went back to Rio and check in then go back to the expo! what a waste of time! I have stayed at RIO many times during my stay in vegas but this will be my last time with them! It's about time they switch out their TVs to flat screens and have Pay-Per-View in their rooms. We wanted to watch the UFC 148 in our room by ordering PPV but they don't even have it!!!\n\nOh oh forgot to mention, I looked at my credit card statement today and noticed that Rio charged me an additional $200!! I was not sure why I was being charged an additional amount, but when I called Rio they said it was a deposit in case there were any damages done to the room. I thought this was strange as I never encountered any additional charges during my stay at Rio. But after talking to some friends, they did mention that the $200 deposit charge is probably because we stayed in a pet friendly room! So disappointed that Rio never informed me about the $200 deposit upon check in!
4;This was a last minute pick after returning a rental to triple a!! The pizza was delicious, fresh, and quick service. The staff was so friendly. Got pizza, wings & salad. Will definitely be back when around!
3;Best Thai I've had in the Mid-west. It reminded me a lot of the Thai that I have had in San Diego.  Very delicious.  They never asked me how spicy I wanted the food, but otherwise it was great.  The food wasn't too spicy though.  When I have Thai, I am always concerned about the heat.  \n\nThe Panang Curry was outstanding.  It had just the right amount of peanut sauce to coconut milk.  An\n\nThe restaurant is in a strip mall, but don't let the looks deter you.  The food is what you come for.  They give you a lot, so make sure that you have a big appitite or take some home. And as always the Thai Iced Tea is delicious.
4;Went to desert wireless today. They repaired my cracked I phone in about 20 minutes. Great service. The employees are friendly and nice. (Mat)
3;My friends and I frequent this establishment more often than we should.  I mean, we're Filipino.  If we're not singing at a house party, we have to be getting our Karaoke on somewhere....RIGHT?!  LOL.  All jokes aside, this place is GREAT. Song selections are on point with many selections to choose from and are pretty updated.  Food and drink menu are also good.  They have liquor specials of buy 2 get 1 free! Plus, from Sunday - Thursday, rooms are 25% off, Friday-Saturday are 15% off.  Service is excellent.  Can't get better than that.  Let's GO!!!
3;Their work is almost prefect especially when it comes to pedicures. I would give them and extra star if they didn't constantly turn walk-ins away. If you don't have an appointment, you're pretty much going to get sent away and asked to come back at a later time/different day. I guess that's a good thing because they're always booked but you can't really count on them to do a last minute job.
3;"Likes:\n\n- Big venue\n- Good music\n- The staff took us to our table quickly and didn't have to really wait in line at all\n- Even though the venue is open to the pool area, we weren't boiling in the upper 90s heat (I guess the AC is working pretty well at this joint)\n\nDislikes:\n\n- Big venue so it's packed to the gills with people\n- Inconsistent dress code enforcement: one minute you see someone with a T-shirt then a completely dressed up dude the next\n- What's with the big table with a bunch of old guys (we're talking 50s here, folks)?\n- Slow table service: we were making our own drinks\n- \""Bigger\"" ladies in tight clothing: sorry, nothing against you big ladies, but tight clothing is a priviledge not a right\n\nPS - I don't know what the other reviewers were talking about when they say it's full of Asians\n\nPPS - get a table + bottle service; I'm not a big fan of fighting a crowd 15 deep just to get a drink no waiting in that ridiculous line"
3;"First, I'd like to thank yelp, because without this site I never would have known this restaurant existed. And I'm glad I took the time to experience it. \n\nWent for lunch with a friend, he had the #6(?) salad, 1/4 chicken, and soup and I had the #16, arroz con pollo with fried yucca instead of french fries. Lots of lunch combos to choose from, mostly revolving around a 1/4 of chicken, chicken breast, pork chops, and possibly fish.. but the combinations seemed endless.\n\nI have to say I was really surprised by the portion of rice, I couldn't finish it. The menu states it is a mix of vegetables and chicken and that it was, a very colourful and tasty blend of peas, corn, carrots, sausage, chicken, (i think that's about right) in rice with a few pieces of yucca. Lots of flavour and perfect consistency. (the yucca was, well, fried yucca. nothing spectacular)\nMy friend's soup was delicious, though we both thought the section of corn still on the cob was a little odd to be served in the bowl, and some of the chicken pieces were a little large. The rotisserie chicken was moist and flavourful.\n\nI'm not sure what the two sauces were on the table, my friend insisted the white one was what was also on his salad, but I was all about the green one. Kind of a green chili cream/mayo sauce? Whatever the ingredients, it had a nice little kick to it.\n\nThe staff was very helpful, and even though the space is small wasn't very crowded for lunch (maybe 1/3 full) There was a bit of a lag between us finishing  our meal and having the plates cleared/receiving the check, maybe because we weren't dressed in suits they assumed we weren't on a lunch break, but it was overall a minor infraction towards the whole meal. \n\nMaybe not the \""best chicken in town\"" like their sign says, but a very good meal and nice portions for a low price (each lunch was under $10). Definitely one to keep in mind when in that area of town."
1;This place is a nightmare. Although Wal-Mart offers great prices, it is confusion. Vegetables and candy in the same aisle??? For some of us that want to grab less than 10 items, the carts are huge and no baskets to be found. And, I know it's school time, but there are school supplies everywhere, right next to the baking item specials. Everything just seems confused and a little disorganized for my liking. Sorry!
2;For the overall experience of dining in, I have to give the place an average rating. Is the pizza good? Yes - definitely good. The Wings? Yum! I love the hot wings. I have never ordered a full pizza, only a slice. Typically I go with the 1 slice + 6 wing & drink combo for $6.\n\nWhat detracts from the experience for me is the wait - today I ordered the above mentioned combo at 11:45 and while the wings arrived somewhat quickly, the slice of pepporoni pizza took a long time. I finally had a complete order and started eating at 12:15. The second thing is the size. This place is about the size of a closet - definitely sucks if you are trying to fit a group of people. By group I would say more than 3. There are a few tables in the main room, a couple outside and some in the back room. The problem is there is no traffic flow - the hallway between the rooms is narrow. If the tables are filled, which normally they are, people stand in the room, the hallway and make it challenging to get through. The fountain drink machine is in the back room and makes for a pile up while people try to find a spot, fill a drink and try to back out of the way. As popular as the business is, an expansion is definitely needed!
2;I always like the meatloaf, mashed potatoes and green beans.  This Bob Evans was like the others.  Average chain service.  Good when needing something familiar :-)
4;"An outstanding business model with wonderful people to execute makes for a very successful enterprise.\n\nI've been a loyal Southwest customer for many years, traveling for both business and pleasure frequently. But Southwest was not an easy choice. Growing up in Denver and watching Frontier grow as the hometown airline where you couldn't help but have an emotional connection (I was incredibly loyal to Frontier). However, unlike Frontier, or others that try to make you feel special on the outside, but slowly push you towards the realization that they're nothing more than just a money making facade, Southwest is the real deal.\n\nFirst, no great business can have mediocre people. And I'm convinced that mediocre are bred at large facilities specializing in making people robot drones that have no personality, no ability to think critically and follow an exact script- insert US Airways training facility here.\n\nSouthwest however actually allows their employees the freedom and ability to ACT! Their opinions respected and their decisions honored. What other airline allows their flight attendants to \""buy\"" the guy in seat 22A a drink for moving yet a few more rows back to accommodate a family with screaming children? Unfortunately in most other places that drink would have been inventoried, check-listed and held under lock and key until the payment cleared the Federal Reserve and Alan Greenspan returned back to Washington to approve.\n\nSecond, the business model. For the customer it's easy, it's convenient and it's actually flexible! You can figure out with a very low IQ exactly how everything works. Need to change a ticket? Yes, and there is no, \""bam! surprise $150 change fee.\""\n\nFly frequently? In a very short period of time you're considered a loyal customer and placed on the A-List or A-List Preferred- which also happens to be the best loyalty program in the world. Yes, I said it... world! If you disagree, go educate yourself. Free priority baggage check and priority security screening so that arriving at the airport 2 hours before your scheduled departure isn't necessary- yes please.\n\nKind of like the tooth fairy as a kid, though even more unexpected Southwest actually puts stuff in my mailbox. The most beneficial of which are my annual birthday card (1 of two birthday cards I received this year; thanks mom) and DRINK COUPONS! Hooray for free drinks.\n\nI keep reading reviews that say Southwest is great for short flights, however I believe that Southwest is great for ANY flight. I also read reviews about the uncomfortable seats... really? At 6'5\"" I would consider myself just shy of an expert on airline seating arrangements. Really though, the experts over at SeatGuru have confirmed what I've known to be true for a very long time. Southwest seats have more space between the seat in front of them and the best \""full, upright position\"" seat pitch. Unless you pay for an upgrade over at US, Southwest has the most comfortable seats in the airline business.\n\n--Side note, I actually have to sit with my feet elevated off the ground on most planes as the distance from my lower back to knee is greater than the space between the back and bottom of the seat and the frequent flier magazine crammed into the seat back pocket of the seat in front of me. Now that just sucks- and I don't have to deal with that with Southwest.\n\nOverall, a phenomenal airline with great people that make flying just a bit more exciting and dare I say it, enjoyable. Thanks Southwest- you guys rock!"
4;This is my favorite shop in Phoenix. It houses Eastside Records and many(10?) other vendors in the same vein as Crossroads in Portland. They've got tons of new/used records, tapes, audio gear, clothing and books. For the most part though, it is a record store with a great selection and good prices. I would say that the majority of the records are used, but they also have good new releases and reissues. The Punk, Jazz and Reggae sections are huge compared with anyone else in town. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and there's always new stuff in the new arrivals bin when I stop by.
4;I enjoyed the swanky new look. The ahi tuna was amazing! I ordered the 11 oz sirloin, it was worth every penny. The waiter Timothy was very attentive and filled our drinks before we even asked. My wife enjoyed our dinner as much as I did.
0;Just got back from this place and it was mediocre at best.  While we were greeted quickly and our drink orders were taken in a reasonable amount of time, it took almost 15 minutes to get our two draft beers.  We should have taken that as a sign and left then but decided to order.  Over 20 minutes later we finally had our burger and sandwich.  The kicker was they were not even busy on this Sunday night and no explanation was ever offered as to why things were taking so long.\n\nTo top it off, the food was simply OK.  We should have bypassed this place and gone down to the Triple 7 for some good food.
2;This place was on the mono rail stop too, so we got off and took a look around.  The casino floor is small, crowded and packed with people.  It's an old property but kept up and clean.  The smoke is more noticeable because of the low ceilings.  This one will stay on the bottom of the re-visit list.
3;This has replaced Chia Bistro as our go-to take-out place.  The food is tasty and seems relatively fresh for Chinese delivery/take-out.  Prices are competitive and delivery is fast, even in Friday night traffic.  \n\nThe spring rolls and beef and broccoli are tasty and filling, with plenty of veggies.  \n\nIf you live in or near Highland Creek, give these guys a shot!
0;NOT a fan...anymore!
3;I didn't stay at the hotel so I can't comment on that, but I did come here for afternoon tea with my sister.\n\nIt's one of the pricier options for afternoon tea in Edinburgh but I'd say it's worth the price. The pastries, scones, and sandwiches were all delicious and my only vice is that the portions are too small. But that's to be expected of all afternoon tea spreads. And plus, let's be real, it's the Missoni. Everyone knows that people in fashion don't eat.\n\nThe atmosphere is trendy. If the name doesn't clue you in that Missoni operates this hotel, the decor certainly does.\n\nI had really friendly and attentive service when I was here and was very happy. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone else interested.
4;Love this place! I ADORE the Southern Hussy! My husband loves the magic in the ivy, both fresh and regular. Fantastic service every time too. Always friendly and on top of it!
1;Price is fine for a $5 foot long...but bread was undercooked. That's a first.\n\nBread was falling apart (Italian) and was not the same quality that I'm used to.
1;"Jillian's is where your office goes to have a big event on the cheap w/ alcohol, some fun and some games (e.g. pool, expensive video games, air hockey). \n\nAtmosphere - Warehouse-ish, dark, woody, open, big, Concord Mill-ish, dated.  Did I say big yet? \n\nService - Friendly, confused, helpful.  The staff here is very friendly and helpful (gave me a tip on coming in early to watch the fight on the cheap).  They are confused, as two told me the pool table area was open while three told me it was reserved.  I guess it was open reserved?  This kind of stunk, as pool was the reason we went here.\n\nFood - Like Chad said, \""you aren't really going for the food, are you?\""  This place is all about appetizers and booze, but appetizers do not make a meal.  So I chose the booze.  The mixed drink @ $5.75 was not bad, star added!!  \n\nOverall - Jillian's is best if your company invites you, you are with a group of 10 + or if there is some special sporting event being televised.  Other than that, this is not the best game in town."
3;Me and my friend enjoyed dining here tonight. Our sever was very friendly and did a great job waiting on us. The drinks and food were a good portion. All of the seafood we got were  seasoned just right and very delicious! I also enjoyed the good blues music.\nGood food, Good service, Good atmosphere. \nGreat place!!
3;ok food cool interior and nice server will be back for sure!!
0;Cucumber collins one of their specialty drinks? Not something I would put down on that side of the menu. I took maybe two sips? Scary to think what their other specialty drinks taste like..
3;Had them deliver and it was still hot!  Always great service and really yummy!!
2;It's more like 2.5 stars but I didn't pay my boss did, and I don't want to know how much he spent either.\nOver all this place was okay.\nI admit the servers were very good, attentive, talkative, the atmosphere was not bad either but the food........ unbelievably average!!\nComing from Los Angeles, I guess we are so used to good quality, high standard Asian bistro type of food.\nMost of the food we had were so salty. I started to wonder if they wanted us to keep ordering wines and beers to wash it down.\nFilet mignon steak - tender and juicy good portion of beef , but why wasabi flavor bread crumbs outside???\nWe were impressed with the desserts, everything was yummy.  I can give 4 stars to their desserts.
0;SCAM SCAM SCAM!! I WILL NEVER USE THIS COMPANY AGAIN. They picked us up fine from the airport to the hotel, but going back to the airport was horrible. The shuttle never even showed up. We called them numerous times, the customer service lady kept telling us, oh the driver is on the way, just wait there. We waited an hour and 45 min. We had to catch a cab to the airport. We even called the customer service for refund, but they didn't even pick up the phone. \nSHOWTIME TOURS IS SCAM. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A GREAT TIME IN VEGAS, DON'T EVER USE THIS COMPANY.
4;This place was delicious. I had a gyro sandwich that came piled high with lamb. So much so that the next time I go back I'll order an extra pita for the overflow. There is no such thing as too much and I'll never say it was, but adding an extra pita will greatly enhance your eating experience. Along with the gyro I had some of their tasty, crispy french fries which I'll ask them to add a portion of to my next sandwich, an Israeli delicacy that I very much enjoy. Though I took the food to go, the atmosphere of the restaurant reminded me of something you'd find in New York, lots of Greek art and maps plus a mediocre movie on television. If you go be sure to check in! You'll take home a free drink. A+ on this place, I can't wait to go back
1;I was actually looking for Zabas, which has apparently closed, when I came across this Panera location. My review is not so much for the food, which was perfectly fine--a simple turkey BLT and a strawberry fields salad, nor for the employees who were polite and attentive. Nope, my impression of the place was ruined by the filthiness of the bathrooms.  After I placed my order, I went to use the ladies' room. It was absolutely gross--not just messy and needing a quick clean. The kind of grime on the floors, in the corners, and around the base of the stall walls wasn't from a busy day or even week. I don't think those floors have been properly scrubbed and mopped ever!  The restaurant didn't seem short-staffed either. I counted at least 6 employees at the counters. Management really needs to take care of that.
3;I've lived in a lot of apartments all over the country and so far this has been the best experience.  The building is guarded 24/7, so you get a great sense of security.  The indoor pool/hot tub is nice, the staff is very friendly and is located within easy walking distance of the Strip, a few malls, a grocery store, target, the airport and a lot of other things.  If you're out of shape it may not be walking distance for you, but I've walked everywhere since I've lived here in 110 weather and I've been just fine, even a few times in formal attire.  I'm a student at UNLV so I spend all day walking around campus too. (It's about a 5 min walk from the UNLV campus ~10 min from the student union building.)\n\nPros-\nGreat location (people saying this is the ghetto have never lived in NY/Philly/Boston, I consider this a nice neighborhood.)\nPool/Hot Tub\nSecurity\nQuite\nNo bugs/pests\nOur first month was free\nShowers never run out of hot water\n\nCons-\nPool is always dead, this place used to be basically a retirement community and only recently started allowing younger people to move in, rarely meet interesting people.\nGym is kind of a joke, they are building a new one. Doesn't bother me to much since I use UNLV gym.\nWalk in security gate gets so hot it can burn you to touch it. - Minor\nOnly take check or money order for rent (Seriously?  It's 2014, every apartment I've lived in before takes debit/credit)\n1 washer/dryer per floor, no hook up in our floor plan for your own.\n\nThe last two cons are my only real gripes.
1;I hate to give a place that offers homemade veggie burgers two stars, but that's all I could muster. The service was very friendly, and the complimentary homemade potato chips were good. The onion rings were sliced a little thinly, which made them limp and not quite qualified as finger food. The black bean burgers really didn't hold together well at all. They really would have been better off wrapping them in a tortilla and calling them burritos. And over $31 for two burgers, a shared side, and two iced teas is pretty steep. You can eat the same quality and quantity of food, with much less fat, at Chipotle for half the price.
0;Terrible, terrible service.  And the waitress' uniforms made me uncomfortable, their dress is fine but the lock on their choker necklace, very tacky. And did I mention about their service? Horrible! We waited an hour and a half, and still didn't get our food. Maybe cause  it's the way we were dressed, but I had better service at Lawry's wearing sweatpants and a t-shirt.
4;I feel lucky to be able to work out at the Village. The yoga instructors are my favorite part about it - all or most of them are from At One Yoga. The equipment is state of the art & the facilities are very nice. Plus it has one of the best views in town of Camelback Mtn from the back patio/tennis courts!
3;"I finally found a British restaurant in the North Valley and what wonderful fish and chips.  I've eaten in other Phoenix British oriented restaurants, but the fish in this small, unique place is the best.  I went to Southend, England last fall and had fish and chips, I can honestly say, it was a perfect match to The Codfather fish, very good.  You'll want to try all their various dishes and specialty items, but be careful with the sausage rolls, they make the sausage fresh every day and you end up taking several home with you.  They have now opened their Pub, attached to the restaurant with various brands of ale and beer.  You'll find this a perfect reminder of the UK, they also have carry-out and you can order large meals to go also.  Try it, you'll really love it and don't forget the salt and malt vinegar; the non-English will probably ask for tartar sauce."
4;"Buying a car....a fun and yet totally terrifying process for most.... :(\n\nAfter months and months and months of test drives, reading consumer reports magazines, looking up crash test ratings, analyzing the difference between \""intelligent\"" AWD and \""full-time\"" AWD, and stressing my already stressed brain out, I finally decided to purchase a 2011 Subaru Legacy 2.5i Premium w/ the all weather package and moon roof ;)\n\nLiving in Decatur, I searched all the Subaru dealerships in a 75 mi radius and found THE ONE...well a graphite Subaru legacy w/ all the fixins' and trimmins' I desired in Champaign. Whoohoo. I made contact with the dealership and prayed no one would pick it up before I could get over there. Sure enough, I arrived in Champaign at around 5:30 after work on a Monday and purchased my car right on the spot!!!!!\n\nThe sales guy I dealt with was knowledgeable about the car (particularly since the dealership sold exclusively Saturns about 8 months ago), friendly, and (most importantly) honest. As you have read above, and in an effort not to be swindled, which I hear happens quite a bit in these types of negotiations, I DID my research. I knew from just about every website what the invoice price of the car was and how much each addition was worth and they matched all the numbers I found digit for digit. I was shocked, I didn't think car salesman dealt this way...or maybe I just watch too much TV.  After all the numbers were lined out, I went over to get approved for financing. Their financing lady is beyond helpful and friendly. No fast-talking or nickle and diming you here. Love it! On top of that when the sale was all final, the sales guy stayed at least 30 min. past closing to go over EVERY inch of the car with me to make sure I didn't have any remaining questions after leaving the dealership. Amazing! It basically goes without saying I left happy (and relieved) that I finally got my new car and it was THAT easy."
1;"ugh.. not impressed.\n\nI absolutely dislike when companies claim \""natural\"" and \""safe\"" ingredients yet have done no basic research on the ingredients they claim are natural and up the price on their goods for those who don't know enough to do their own research and don't know they're buying the same unsafe products.\n\nOKAY, don't hate me, because I know there are SERIOUS devotees to Lush.  Good for you.  Don't get me wrong, I am willing to spend good money on good products when I have confirmed they are indeed \""good products\"".. so I'm not a \""hater\"".  I'm just a factualist... if that word even exists.\n\nTake for example their soaps and shampoos and lotions which contain several ingredients that are known to be harmful.. I won't go through those ingredients here as I don't have the space, but I just want to mention it so you are informed of the \""natural\"" products your paying a premium for that aren't so natural or safe.  If you want to read more, google search it.... it'll open your eyes.\n\nInteresting to note their website no longer contains a link to their ingredients.. \n\nOkay, so now that I've explained why I give them low stars for advertising quality at a premium when in fact it isn't... I'll comment on the rest of the store and services.  \n\nStars diminish for: Staff personnel were very pushy to me and my sister the whole time.. she never left our side and kept pushing us to try this and that out and even applying samples to us.. we seriously turned around a few times to lose her but she kept coming back... she also didn't even know any answers to the questions we had about the ingredients, so she deferred to her boss who told us that, yes, parabens and SLS was safe and so was FDA food colors in their soaps and shampoos... umm, yeah, obviously any research on that will show you that clearly is not the case.\n\nalright.. now for the good...I do have to admit that they DID have *some* clean and very safe products... a lot of them had simple and natural ingredients that, if you do a query, are not unsafe and used by a lot of pharmaceutical grade naturopathic companies.  THOSE I will buy and will gladly pay for...  they did have some freshly made cleansers they kept in a fridge that had some very raw and natural ingredients... I think I would try those products for sure."
0;"I LOVE THEIR FOOD. don't get me wrong. but WHY i gave only one star.\nbecause of ONE WAITRESS. One girl who serve there. She treats customer unprofessionally RUDE. she has half of her face hidden with her bang. (only one side. thought that weird too. remind me of japanese cartoon). her hair kinda gross too as a waitress but well.. \"" I Love sushi koma\""  All my friends loves to go there too. we know a boss too. he is really really kind!! i think their sushi is one of best in las vegas.\nBUT that little girl. Her attitude to customer made me don't want to go there ANYMORE.  that bad.  I thought it was only me. BUT my friends said to me same thing. but different situation but they need to get rid of that waitress. i would like to share what happen but i don't want to spread personal business of mine. but seriously this is 1st time i write a review for restaurant in my life. \nsushi koma. i really want to go there but i don't wan a see her attitude.\nI may slap her when i see her bad attitude again."
1;Located in Terminal four on the corridor for gates A1-A15, thei Fox concept restaurant is surprisingly like the restaurants on the outside, down to the prices being charged for food and drinks. Service was friendly, including offering recommendations for local beer. \n\nThe food left something to be desired. I ordered the pork tacos, with rice and black beans (no choice in beans at this location.) Rice was mushy and not much better than out of a box.\n\nFlour tacos were small, but were hot and good. The pork had little evidence of green chili flavor, and the pico and lettuce did not add much. The meat was moist but just unexciting. I would return, but definitely choose a different menu item. I was not offered chips and salsa.
2;Casa is a pretty cool place\nAll patio bar, too and bottom floor\nI didn't notice until last week that they have a lounge on the East side of the building, I will have to check that out. The Mojitos at Casa are really good and the bartenders are very nice and friendly. The crowd that goes to Casa varies but mostly younger college 20 year olds. Seating can also be a hit or miss depending on the day. Will have to come back to try the street tacos.
4;The stuffed burgers they sell, awesome. Frozen cheese curds are also available here, oh yes.
4;CARLO is GREATEST bartender!\nCame to meet some friends late night and Carlo was super friendly and took good care of our crew!
2;my irish buddy and i came by here since it was still lent and we weren't in the mood for Filet-o-Fish. a litle pricey for lunch, i thought, at $18. food was good though. lots of options. lots of sushi especially. the tempura veggies and shrimp were yummy. may just come back next year if we don't find a less expensive spot. \n\noh, and be advised, cab drivers don't stop by here to get you.
0;Second worst Roberto's Taco Shop in town.\n\nI wasn't even able to order because they don't accept credit cards. \n\nOn top of that the locations is very hidden and the inside is very dirty looking and small. \n\nThe staff was just unsure of what to do being that I had already ordered. They charge a crazy fee for debit card transactions. \n\nStay away...
4;Stephen Lynch is a hair genius!! \n\nI've been seeing Stephen for about 4 years now, and every time I go in, I leave feeling completely pampered. He not only gives the best scalp massages on earth, but his attention to detail and his passion for hair is evident in the amount of time he will spend with you every single time you go in. It seems like Stephen never has an off day! \n\nI've only had my hair cut by Stephen (I don't color my hair) and no matter where I go I have people stopping me on the street - complete strangers - to ask me who styled my hair! I could not recommend Stephen more highly!
1;"This place isn't bad, it just isn't a 5-star kind of hotel -- that's all.\n\nYou can read about all the nice things, but my only 3 problems are:\n\n1. The rooms. They're just kind of old school and a bit nasty. The bathroom still had someone else's hair on the ground. The felt old and crusty. This hotel was probably amazing 15 years ago. Also, the work area is crap... not even a real office chair. I killed my back trying to work off a living room chair.\n\n2. The food. The steak joint was good but way overpriced for the quality. Michael Mina has better joints. Not bad, just not what I expected after eating at 4 different Mina joints. The Hacienda place was \""meh\"" at best.\n\n3. The bugs. I had drinks at the outside bar on both nights and every time we saw what I can only describe as giant mf'ing crickets/grasshoppers/wtf's crawling on the bar counter inches from us. We told some waiter about it and he ignored us. Finally one of the cool bartenders got on top of it while the other one was totally freaked out. Not good to have around booze and food. Ruined everyone's vibe."
2;A nice cozy place with respect to the environment but other than this nothing impressive. Food selection and imagination is poor, while the ingredients seem not to be fresh at all. Service is decent.
2;Ikea cafeteria... I finally ate at one.  I had heard about the meatballs for a long while and finally took the plunge.  After years of anticipation, they were... meh.  Good enough I guess but pretty greasy. lol  I really liked their chocolate cake though, and cheap bowl of salad... and lingon berry soda.\n\nProlly won't see ya there!
2;"I just back from 3 days at this Resort. I was celebrating a belated 60th Birthday with my daughters. One of my daughters lives in Scottsdale, we just decided to spend the time at a local resort. This Resort Casino is beautiful and has great potential as a top rated stop. I travel a lot and spent 30 years working and owning tourist hot spots. \n\n1. The room was lovely, but had not been dusted in a while, I'm sure , which we overlooked, it is the desert and we checked in on a Tues. But we were not pleased when not one of those three days did we get our room ' cleaned ' . It was refreshed, but no vacuum, dusting, cleaning sinks, toilets or even the bathtub. It might have been ok, if there was at least a toilet brush to keep the toilet cleaned. We had to ask them to make the bed at least, doesn't everyone want a fresh made bed. So refreshing the room consists of restocking towels and coffee, no cleaning. \n\n2.  Loved the pools, the shallow one allows you to sit on a reclining chair in the cool water under a sun umbrella. You can order drinks from a service person who comes around. But I have a couple complaints here. A. There were a lot of bugs floating in the water, again it is the desert. But in the water drains big spiders were tending their eggs of babies. It's kinda freaky knowing they were going to hatch hundreds of babies to join the already many bugs in the pool. B. The drinks we ordered were very weak and when I playfully mentioned they'd be great if I could taste the alcohol, the waiter said \"" well if you hadn't been drinking alcohol for 40 years you might be able to taste it\"" . He was dead serous. Not a smile or a wink. I ordered a straight shot and I can tell you, 40 years of  ' experience in both drinking and the service industry , the alcohol is watered down. C. And he also insisted that I must sign the tab every time he brought a drink, even with a room tab. Which we found out wasn't really practice. He just wanted us to close out each tab so he could get tipped. And yes I tipped even though he was insulting and unfriendly. D. One of the waitresses who waited on us, wore her skirt so short, her butt cheeks hung out, and when she walked by serving people in the pool, you could see she wore a thong, maybe, I hope cause you could see a dark triangle between her legs. It was not a pretty sight as she was overweight and sloppy. \n\n3. The staff was only about 40 % friendly. Most of them would pass you without batting an eye or a smile, even those who were serving us. I told a young lady in the hall this morning, when she said \"" good morning \"" , that she was literally the only person in three days who had said good morning, good after noon or good evening , or who spoke in a friendly way except front desk personnel or the guys standing at the podiums to see your key when you went into the hotel. The food servers were Luke  warm, there were 2 in three days of eating meals there who were really nice and good! For the most part they were dutiful. \n\n4. When we went to pick up tickets for a show at will call, the girl actually told us the show was no good and a waste of money. When in fact, employees should be promoting the shows there and keeping their personal opinions to themselves. In fact the show was enjoyable and a big part of why we stayed there. \n\nNow for the good ... It is live ! Feels like a Vegas Casino. The energy is good. Hate the smoking ! But I can live with it. There are a lot of good places to eat. The lights are beautiful, the pool is open 24/7. The parking is free and the valets are friendly and good looking. I'll go there again, I just wish the management would actually care about people's opinions and make this place a place where people are welcomed and feel good about being there. Keeping the rooms as clean as the casino is just doing their job and being friendly doesn't cost and might actually make the place more money. \n\nSuzanne ... Oregonian who loves Scottsdale."
3;I got the groupon for this place and I loved it. I like the concept of the business and the store looks very inviting. The ice cream is nice and creamy but the cookies can be a little crunchy. The portions are pretty big and are only $3 per sandwich. Overall,  it definitely satisfies my sweet tooth cravings!
0;We BEG ALOT nail shop! OMG they STAY adding 5 dolla more! I REMEMBER why I stopped going there by the time I abruptly left because the nancy chick started working on another chicks nails at the same time as mine UUGGHH! they are MONEY DRIVEN no real sentiment for keeping repeat customer and for that I'll be going to EVERY nail shop in Arizona until I feel I have one that actually caters to Me.\n\nPro Ten nails SUCK BIG TIME!\nYou can find a BETTER nail salon THEY SUCK EGGS!!\nGREEDY nancy & tina UUGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
4;Everything I have had here has been good.  That especially goes for the bulgogi fries and fried rice.  Decently priced and the hot sauce is incredible.
0;Really. Your staff needs to learn how to read your ticket orders. We went drive thru waited for about 15 minutes which is not as bad as your usual drive thru line. We ordered 4 burgers and 2 fries. After pulling out we found out that they only gave us 1 order of fries. Went back inside the restaurant and staffs were trying to ignore what happen.  Did not even offer anything for the inconvenience. .. worst customer service ever!!!
2;The pizza was pretty good. Greasy and cheesy which is important to me.\n\nThe only things I would change are the service and the pricing. A little too pricey for what they offer and the guys behind the counter have ZERO personality or social skills. They are literally a-holes to everyone.
0;Absolute worst drip coffee on the planet. Charcoal. Tasted a lot like Caribou. Internet didn't work either.\n\nEdit: My brother and I visited this place and initially thought it was really nice. We really wanted to like it. The owner's asinine replies to this review and other reviews further solidifies that we will never visit this place.
1;Came here looking for some prizes for something that we have to put together for my daughter's school carnival. I thought it would be like your neighborhood Dollar Tree but I was mistaken. This place is pretty big, pretty messy, and downright disgusting.\n\nI didn't make it up and down every aisle since I was trying to find only one or two things. From the looks of it, at least 1/3 of the store is food. I saw a lot of employees stocking shelves. They also have a lot of cheap art and school supplies, kitchen items, even single pairs of ladies undergarments hanging on hangers.\n\nYeah...I won't be back.
0;Everytime I come here they forget something in my order. They all seem to be rude and hate there job. When i have told them I had missing something, they told me that I should of got it myself. Even though the item was behind thr glass case.
3;"So I came here on the recommendation of an acquaintance.\n\nHe sent me this text saying I should come find him at this \""awesome place\"" which I found to be quite vague. So I called him and got the address and for some reason I heard him say beer pong instead of ping pong. \n\nI assume it is the result of my old janky phone and bad reception. I am broke and cannot afford a new one so miscommunication happens often...\n\nI was only mildly disappointed that it was ping pong instead of beer pong and decided to play a few games. I discovered that I really really suck at ping pong\n\nAs for parking ....we just didn't use the blasted valet. We found a spot far far away from the bar. I have a bum ankle but was willing to gimp along if it meant avoiding the kind of headache that using valet usually entails. \n\nWe decided to get some food and started off with ordering waters. Since it was so crazy busy I think the waiter completely forgot about us. I was slightly annoyed because I had just got to Phoenix from Detroit and could barely breathe due to the crazy climate. \n\nI am not kidding; I felt like my mouth was full of sand 24/7 so I was constantly chugging water. So I'm sitting like there wondering if we should just bug someone for some water.\n\nSo we are sitting there chilling out and I'm trying not to die of thirst/or heatstroke someone from management came up to us and apologized. He was really super nice and offered us free food. \n\nI wish I could remember his name because it was a nice gesture. But I can't think of it right now. So we had a bit of a wait but we did get our drinks and free food out of the deal!\n\nThe food there is expensive. That is just my opinion as a broke girl from Detroit. I got the cheapest thing on the menu....the salad and it was surprisingly good considering that it didn't have that much stuff on it.\n\nThe bathroom kind of tripped me out...I was afraid I had accidently wandered into the men's (which I have done before due to being something of a space cadet) because there were men at the sink when I walked in. As it turns out, there is a communal sink area and the bathrooms themselves are adjacent to that. \n\nSo try not to have a panic attack when you see someone of the opposite sex in there when you walk in lol.\n\nI felt kind of out of place ...I tend to like dive bars where I can dress like a scrub and just enjoy my drinks without trying to impress everyone in the place. Many of the women were decked out (I am talking stilettos and minidress and shit) and I was trying to understand why.\n\nThere was also a delightful smattering of douchebags and hipsters there. I have come to terms with this because they are becoming impossible to avoid. Hipsters are like death and taxes: nobody likes them but we have to deal with them anyway so we might as well get used to it.\n\nSo yeah, good food, drinks, and friendly management plus free food! I also learned how to play ping pong (sort of). No complaints here. \n\nThe atmosphere was pretty chill with the exception of overdressed (or maybe I was underdressed?) people who can really cramp a chill vibe in a place. Overall, it was a pretty cool experience."
0;Great place to stay but as far as playing here this is not the place to play never have I seen anyone win here but to stay its a very nice place the rates are up there might need to bring out the savings
3;Nicer than your average PT's as far as ambiance is concerned, it's about the same as a Sierra Gold. Friendly, but aloof service, the waitress seemed to disappear for long periods of time . Good happy hour menu. I bought a regular martini here and it was pretty good and well executed, which I am glad for because it would kind of suck if their martini's were bad. This place had a pretty chill atmosphere.
2;Every now and again I make my way to Von's for groceries.  Of course it's because something I need is on sale.  \n\nThey have a huge parking lot that is easy to navigate in and out.  The store is kept very clean with eye appealing displays. I'm happy that when they put something on sale, it's been in stock for me.  \n\nWhat has been disappointing is the customer service.  The employees aren't very friendly.  I think my cashier said about two words.  No smile. In my opinion, it's the little things that make a difference.  Compared to my normal grocery store, Vons fails.   \n\nYes I will probably do some occasional shopping here.  I hope for some improvement next time.
0;Disappointed. The decor is beautiful but the food is bland. Disconnected service. Parking is a nightmare! The manager is very sweet and tried to correct everything from mistakes on our order to mistakes on our bill but the food isn't good enough to return.
3;"So a couple visits, and a couple specials, later these guys have gone up in my estimations. My previous concerns around menu and costs still stand, however with the ever-increasing competition popping up around the place, each with even more inflated prices and precisely the same variety issues, Burger. has improved by comparison and, as a result, look to be better value compared to many of their peers.\n\nOther reasons for the extra star include the website; they now include their temporary specials on there which is a big plus and saves me having to swing by just to have a nosey. And also their pending Christmas menu which will become available as of the 1st December. A great idea and one I'm looking forward to taking advantage of.\n\nHats off to them for expanding to the west end as well. Hopefully the next expansion will see them make it to Leith, perhaps as part of the continuous facelift of the Walk, and save me a ten min drive henceforth."
3;Yesterday was the first time I've ever been to Mimi's and it was pretty good,  I got chicken with asparagus and mashed potatoes and it was yummy, especially the chicken.  Not too fancy but a nice place to sit and have a pretty good meal.  Good service and reasonable prices.
4;A real hole in the wall place but that adds to the charm. BBQ burrito is amazing and the service is always great. There is no better place for Mexican in charlotte
0;Wish they would display there hours online in a more efficient and accessible way. Came here at 10pm last night after my buddy injured himself at our soccer game only to realize they were closed. This is after we checked online and what seemed to be like they were open 24/7.\n\nMaybe it's my fault for not searching better but typically when your in the NEED of URGENT CARE browsing the internet thoroughly while your operating a motor vehicle can be tough.\n\n**Note-This review isn't based off of any experience I had at this facility. It's based off the fact that I was trying to use their services and wasn't able to do so.
0;I hate to do this.  A Pho joint so close to home and yet so disappointing.  We've tried to give this place many chances and every time it's worse.  The Pho is just OK.  Anything else on the menu, especially if Thai-esque are abominations to Asian food lovers everywhere. The owners and their kids are sweet and I love Mom and Pop places but I just can't recommend this place.
2;Average cafe.  Small not much seating but great lemon meringue pie!
3;Good things about the MGM Grand:  Giant kitty habitat!  And as you enter from across NYNY, you can buy Jello shots for cheap!  It has some of the best dining on the Strip -- Craftsteak, Nob Hill Tavern, and Joel R.'s restaurants.  And more.  And they're all delicious.  \n\nBad things?  Well, the whole Studio Walk part is pretty tacky.  It's a nightmare to park in its garage, and CSI The Experience should get a forensics team in to figure out just who killed the fun in it.
2;"This is an okay place somewhat ruined by all the hype surrounding it. I'll just do a \""pro/con\"" thing:\n\nPROS\n\n-The beef brisket was pretty badass.\n-The homemade root beer was pretty nice, especially after not having root beer for a long time. \n\nCONS\n\n-The lines. We went on a Tuesday night and it was packed. I know there isn't much to do in Old Town Gilbert and maybe this place is the highlight, but geez. By the time you get all the food on your plate, it's cold from waiting in line so long.\n\n-The sides. While the meat offerings all seem super-tasty and well-seasoned and all that, I think they kinda got lazy with the sides. The mac and cheese surely comes out of some frozen package, and other offerings that my table mates had weren't much better. The cornbread was really the low point for me, as it was more the northern \""sweet\"" type and was dry and crumbly.\n\n-BUTTA. Yeah, this is just a pet peeve of mine, but the \""butter\"" they offered was not butter, I'm pretty sure. I'm anal about hydrogenated oils and polyunsaturated posers, and it had the consistency and look of one of those tub margarines, so let's call a spade a spade.\n\n-The seating/atmosphere: Since half of the area is taken up by people waiting in line, you have to sit on the far and dark side of the place (or outside) to avoid people standing over you while you eat. Guess you can't blame a place for being busy, but that doesn't really give any consolation. The place is also so dark, and not in a charming Italian restaurant way. \n\n\nAll-in-all, I'd say this is more of a 2.5 review than a 3. It really just feels like a soup kitchen with a bunch of starving homeless people, but hey: The meat's good."
4;I am VERY pleased with the service from Dr. Gus and his staff from start to finish in regards to my 10 year old Rat Terrier Louie. Dr. Gus listened to all of my concerns, was attentive to Louie's needs, and still practices old fashioned customer service. He and his staff member called me on two different occasions to check on Lou after surgery, and the front desk staff were also very efficient when I returned  for a follow-up visit and collar return.  The prices are quite reasonable, they don't put your animal under anesthesia unless necessary, (which was an issue with another vet closer to home) and in my opinion well worth the drive from San Tan Valley!  Thank you thank you thank you!!!
1;"Tubing for a drip system in my garden is not in gardening; it's in plumbing.  I guess that makes sense as I'm putting a plumbing system in my garden, or at least my wife is.  Light bulbs are not in lighting; they are in a separate light bulb section.  Not sure how to rationalize that one, but changing light bulbs is all me, in case you were wondering.  And so it goes in the aisles of Lowes that feel more like a maze with dead ends, trick turns, and no end in sight.  I would end up blaming myself if customer service weren't lacking.  It seems to be hit or miss with few hits.  The best thing Lowes has going is a convenient location."
0;The happy hour is good but they have t get rid of the old grumpy bartender. Killin the business... We walked out... He apparently thinks he owns the place.. Went to caralbad tavern instead !!!
3;Nice sports bar atmosphere. They have a shrimp appetizer that is so mouthwatering! I wish it was an entree! Food is good - beer is good - we all left satisfied! Recommend the French Dip! We brought my daughter who was 1, and everyone was pretty okay with her being there.
0;Utter piece of crap.\n\n-1 star.
2;We went for pie.  The apple pie was good as far as the filling went--nice and spicy.  But the crust was so big it wasnt cooked thru, I didnt eat it.  The portion--enough for three people--not a good thing for me, but some might like it.  The key lime was good and a bigger portion than other places serve.  Overall, not the best pie ever, the quest continues for great pie.  \nService was slow, waitress was nice.
3;Good food, good prices and VERY fast delivery.  The food is always fresh and the egg rolls are really good!
2;This is like a teeny tiny Daiso-like store, with an aisle of Hello Kitty, a few food items in the back, lots of kitchen tools that are definitely useful, bentos, school supplies, serving platters, and more.  It is a really cute place and everyone who works here is very helpful.  Lately, there have been a lot of green tea flavored sweets which are hard to find, including kit kats, nestle crunch bars, and pocky sticks, so that is a plus.  There are no food-related re-ment gum boxes or donabe, but there are sushi keychains and erasers, handroll holders, lacquer and plastic bentos, and other useful tools.  This is a fun stop for affordable and useful kitchen items and Japanese toys.
4;"Busy but not too busy killer brunch spot off the Strip in North LV.  Menu is amazing and overwhelming at the same time, making for difficult decisions.  Everything here looks so good it is tough to decide on what to eat and drink, as you want to try everything.  The spiked Limeade is a perfect morning-after cocktail; tart enough to mask out the taste of vodka and served with a massive oversize straw for big gulping.  The Gin Mary is really good too, and I am not really into Bloody Marys that much.  Portions are huge.  Had the Favorite Scramble with the salmon, pesto, and brie and tomato.  Biscuit the best I've had in a while. Also a great place to people watch, found myself admiring all the ink, piercings, and different hair colors of the fellow clientele.  Wish I lived near this place, but then again it wouldn't be good for my diet. Probably better that's it's a once-a-year visit. Will return."
3;"Are you not a fan of the \""club scene\"" in Las Vegas? Do you get tired of getting dressed up, just to be able to get in the club? Do you just want some place to just dance your ass off, without anyone caring how cool you look doing it? Well, my friend, Polly Esther's just might be your place.\n\nFirst off, their dress code is casual. In fact, the funkier you look, the better they like it. Second, there is rarely a line. Some might thing, well if there is no line, how good can it be? Well, there's no line because the place is HUGE inside. There are a total of four rooms, all playing different types of music. If you're a disco fan, then they have the clubs namesake 70's room. You can even belly up to a shell of the Partridge Family bus (known as the bar) and order a Brady Punch.\n\nIf your style is more in the last 25 years, there are three more rooms just for you. You can hang out in the 80's room (called Culture Club), complete with it's very own DeLorean. You can head to the 90's room (called Nerve Ana) and sit with Forrest Gump on a replica of the bench he sat on in the movie. Finally, you can go to the 2000 room (called Suite 2000) if you're interested in listening to more current music.\n\nAll in all, this is a club where virtually anyone can have a good time. So, lace up your British Knights and kick step your way down to Stratosphere to hang out at Polly Esther's Nightclub."
2;"Located in the back corner of the mall.  Quick takeout. Interior seating is nice with a L bar for sushi and plenty of booths for groups.  The fried egg roll appetizer was very good with plenty of pork filling. The pad see ew was over spiced with what I believe is basil, but a very large portion.  They give plenty of beef and broccoli in the pad see ew, but not enough noodles, I would have preferred a little more.  I also like how they ask what level of spice you'd like, 0 - 10; after ordering a level 2, there was barely any spice to it, I can't imagine what a 0 would be, nor could I imagine the level of spice in a 10."
2;The pictures made this Thai joint a more exciting place to visit.  I enjoyed my food here.  I ordered the Red Curry medium spice.  I was tasty but nothing to rave about.  Pad See Ew of course was ordered, but I didn't get much kick out of it.  I think I enjoyed looking at their plating more then the taste.  Service was good.  The decor I must say --- Finally!  Something different for once at a Thai restaurant! - Enjoy!
4;What a great meal we just enjoyed at the Border Grill in Mandalay Bay.  We are local to Las Vegas, and like the Border Grill because you can get in and out of the place without having to valet park or use the garage, so its convenient for locals.  That is just one of the benefits, the food has always been great but tonight we had a tasting menu and we were very impressed.\nI had the Fillet and my wife had the scallops as the main course, but the appetizer and deserts were just as amazing.  The price is very fair - locals ask about the VIP discount plan.  Great enjoyable place.  Check it out.
4;I can't remember the last time I ate at a Denny's.  When I think of going out to breakfast, I want to go to these popular little spots like the Cracked Egg, The Egg and I, or Hash House a gogo.  This particular Sunday I had a lot of running around to do and missed breakfast. I was STARVED.  One of my friends who is a super healthy eater had just texted that he was on a road trip and found a Denny's to aid in his healthy eating. I couldn't imagine what he could get at a Denny's that would be healthy OR delicious.  Boy was I wrong!\n\nIn between errands, I spotted the Denny's on Tropicana and decided to give it a try. It was fairly empty so I got seated right away and service was great.  I ordered the Fit Fare omelet with a side of fruit and it was amazing. Everything was cooked perfectly and the fruit was super fresh.  I've had healthy omelets at other breakfast places before and none tasted this good. My tummy was very happy.\n\nIn addition to the awesome food, the place is very clean and service was very quick. Perfect spot for a quick and cheap, but awesomely delicious and healthy breakfast at any of the day.
1;I saw this place online somewhere, the whole concept is marketed pretty well.\n\nThe only downfall(the most important one) is that the food sucks, the only thing that doesn't suck is the mexican coke with real cane sugar !!! But heart attack grill doesn't even make the coke, so they pretty much just suck. \n\nIf the burger actually tasted good, it would be unhealthy if you ate all of it. \nBut since the burger has no taste, and is just a piece of cooked meat on a huge bun, with a few measly pieces of tomato, there is nothing that would really make you want to go back. \n\nI had the 1/2 lb. burger, and ate the entire burger but didn't eat 1/2 of the bun.  I only ate the burger because I paid for it, and I was hungry, or else I probably wouldn't have even eaten it. \n\nThe fries are soggy and gross.  I don't usually add salt on my food, but I had to put salt on these fries to eat them, and they were still pretty gross. \n\nI was going to order a milkshake, but the milkshake was in such a small cup that there was no justifying the $5 price tag. \n\nThe only novelty in this restaurant is the scale outside the door, and the slutty nurse costumes that the waitresses must wear. \n\nThe waitresses are friendly, and the owner is the doctor looking man with the stethoscope around his neck. \n\nWe came in on Friday around 6pm, and there were only 30 or so patrons in a room meant for at least 75.... they should probably improve their food, and add more items to the ( 5 item menu) or I don't see why anyone would bother coming back.
0;Our food was brought out cold.  It took so long for the waitress to come back to check on our group and we were hungry because no one ate before our drive out to Vegas, we ate some of it anyway. We finally got someone else over to our table to make them aware we were served cold food, and the manager's solution was to send it back to be prepared again, so we had to wait even longer for our meal. We were already over the whole dining experience and besides we had eaten some of the cold food anyways, so the dinner was a bust!
1;Checked in for a party of two, was told there would be a 30 minute wait.  In reality, the wait was 5 minutes.  Not sure the hostess' know what they are doing.\n\nWas seated, took 10 minutes for the waiter to show up.    Drinks were slow to arrive.   Pollo fundido arrived cold.   \n\nWaiter never asked how the food/everything was.   Drink refills were very slow/non-existent.    Manager never came by to touch-tables.   \n\nOverall, have had much better food and far better service elsewhere.
2;This place is located in a shady-looking building. Their noodle bowls are huge but they also cost $9-10 which is pretty pricey for Viet food. The bun bo hue is actually pretty good and I would come here for that if craving it while in Vegas. Their bun rieu is supposed to be good but I was not a fan. The pho was just ok. Better than AZ pho but not close to CA or home-made.  Their nem nuong rolls were also large and tasty.
1;I've been here quite a few times, and I always try to like it cause theres a lack of good sports bars near Pitt. They have a ton of nice HDTVs.\n\nEverytime I go, there is always a weird taste to one (or more) of the beers that I get. I was just there for the Pitt/Oakland game and got a Redhook. I drink this beer regularly, and something was wrong with the beer. Its definitely hard to describe, but something is always off (others in my party notice it too).\n\nThe food is hit or miss. I got the French onion soup last time. It was good. Nothing ground breaking, but solid soup. I've had the pork nachos and they were blah.
4;OMG the Greek Fries RULE!!!  I got the Portabello Mushroom Pita with fries and had them prepared Greek style and as AMAZING as the sandwich tasted, I wished I'd just gotten a heaping platter of those Greek Fries.  Best fries I've ever had.  \n\nGood food, good service, friendly help and comfy booths.  Two filling meals with beers for $23.  Totally worth every penny.   People need to try this place out!  Well kept secret!
1;When the Golden Corral first opened we were very excited to have one in our area but when we went the first time we were very disappointed with the way it is set up.  Everything is crowded and people are practically climbing over each other to get to the chocolate fountain.  Getting from one end of the food selection s to the other is almost like a balancing act trying to hang on to your plate while dodging people!  I figured it was still new and that's why it was so crowded so we waited a few months before trying it again.  Last nite was worse!  The restrooms were a mess, the floors were wet, there was no toilet seat covers in some of the stalls and again, it was so crowded you had to dodge people to get anywhere.  People were rude, kids were running around and yelling....  THIS time we didn't stay.....
2;Bread Company has a selection of great ingredients that results in good food, but the service is terribly inconsistent. I have a bunch of stories about this, but here's the two that contrast most significantly: (1) When I came for afternoon drinks with my writing group, it was quiet and we received great, not-too-hands-on service: a nice mixture of noticing when we might want more drinks and letting us alone.\n\n(2) A few weeks ago, my husband and I went with a party of 6 for dinner 1 1/2 hours before a show, told them our schedule, and were assured that we should have plenty of time. Cool -- except that the whole thing turned out to be kind of a disaster. We all ordered at the same time, and there seemed to be plenty of servers for a full room at dinner, but our meals arrived over the course of a half-hour (the pasta came after the steak, hmm). Fresh and tasty dinners, yes, but it was impossible to wait and eat together, and everyone was antsy due to the delays. In the end, we finished 20 minutes after our preferred time and our waitress did not seem particularly motivated to help the situation along or even really apologize.\n\nSo: Good food, decent wine, but the service is a gamble. Try it, but go on a quiet weeknight -- definitely not for a Krannert opening or right before another occasion.
1;Soup was horrible. The tortillas in it was very soggy. The drink I had was horrible. It was suppose to have some spice and ginger in it but tasted really bad. \n\nGuac was ok and salsa was very bland. I like a lot more taste and flavor and this place definetely did not cut it.
2;So at the time I was very impressed because that apple fritter really was the best I've ever had.  But it was a tiny bit raw in the middle...  Had to be reflected.\n\nThe cake donut was ok, I've never been a huge fan of these and no its not special here.\n\nThe boston creme donut - my favorite donut - was fluffy and soft so good in that way.  However, the filling was only in half the donut and it tasted chalky..  :'(\n\nThe apple fritters like I said were wonderful.  By far the best thing I tried here.  It's almost like they fried a puddle of krispy kreme dough with some apples mixed in.  Very soft and fluffy.  Slightly too much glaze and a tiny bit raw in the middle.. but it will still haunt my dreams.  \n\nI would definitely stick to plain glazed with or without chocolate and fritters.  Yum!
3;Churn is designed as a classic ice cream shop (and has the accompanying candy to prove it) but also features some different flavors and interesting sundaes. I've gotten the S'mores sundae before, and though pretty good, was a little too much for me. I'd stick to a regular sundae. Usually I get the ice cream cookie sandwich. Pick two freshly baked cookies and an ice cream that they scoop right in there. \n\nOnce you get your treat, head to the back patio, which adjoins the back patio for Windsor, the restaurant next door. They're open late and they're always peppy, so be prepared to reciprocate with at least a smile.
3;Finally, wow! The Pressbox got a much needed facelift!  Brazwell's is a clean and modern looking pub.  It was packed on Saturday night both inside and out on the patio with a very fun crowd.  The new food menu looks great with plenty of things to try.  \n\nWe went back for lunch and I had a bbq chicken sandwich that was just so-so.  But their fish sandwich was great, lightly battered and cooked perfectly.  I hear they have a fish and chips dinner special on Fridays. So I'll definitely be back for that.
3;I used the taco cart for catering a birthday party for 50 people. They arrived on time,  set up quickly, and were all super friendly. The food was amazing!  I got chicken,  carne casada, and carnitas. Everyone at the party raved about the food and many have already asked for the contact info to use themselves.  I plan on visiting the restaurant for lunch as well. The service is easy & convenient since they bring everything they need,  including plates,  utensils,  and napkins, then clean everything up before they go.  You also get to keep whatever is left over. I researched several companies before choosing Taqueria Guadalajara and picked them from all their positive reviews. I'm so glad I chose them!
1;I checked out this restaurant at the Mirage right before watching Beatles 'Love.' The restaurant has a nice ambiance and is conveniently located in the middle of the casino. I read all the reviews on Yelp before checking this place out and was expecting great things. The service was great with fast and friendly service. The food however, was disappointing. I got the all you can eat $40 deal. They served cheese rolls and crackers that were tough to eat and slightly stale. The vegetables tasted like bad cafeteria food, the rice and beans were bland, and the salad was soggy. Then came the meats which were poor cuts, barely seasoned and tough to eat. I tried all the meats and my favorite was the lamb, and even that wasn't great. I'm a huge fan of Brazilian BBQ but I was hugely disappointed with this one. For $40 all you can eat, you're much better off going to one of the casino buffets. The only benefit here was the short wait time.
2;Ate lunch here. Was good!  Service was friendly
1;"Saw this place on Triple D.\n\nMy expectations were way to high for this place. \n\nThe service was terrible. It took our waiter 10 minutes to get our water. We didn't get our bread and crab cake another 20 minutes. We didn't get our entree food until about 1 hour after ordering. Other people got their food way faster than we got our food and we were there before them. We were really ready to walk out on this place. If it weren't for my partner suggesting to stay I would've walked out. \n\nThe food was mediocre. The Shrimp and Grits was \""okay.\"" nothing I would eat again. The grits were very gummy and gritty. The Shrimp was good and very well seasoned.  Pauls Jambalaya tasted good. Nothing we'd order again. I don't think we'll be coming here anytime soon. \n\nBut then again our service was terrible so maybe I am judging the food to hard."
2;In an effort to try new places near the office, we gave this place a shot.  The inside is much like a Chipotle in ordering style, menu etc.  The concept is interesting (burgers, hot dogs, burritos), but I was in the mood for a burger.  I had the Bueno style with pepper jack cheese.  It had fresh guacamole on top, and the pepper jacks cheese gave it just enough spice.  The fries and drink were not included in the $6 it cost for the burger, a little pricey.  The service was alright, thought instead of bringing out our meals by number they just walked over and asked what we ordered.  I think this ended up in a couple mix ups with another table's order, but we got it worked out. \n\nAll in all an ok place, maybe I'll give it a try again for a hot dog or burrito...\n\nPS: Yes, you will smell like a campfire the rest of the day after eating here.
1;"Stopped in here the other day, really wish I had explored other options.  Food was ok, burger was certainly nothing special, fries ok.  My main \""beef\"", I found this place trying to be pretentious and very overpriced.  They succeeded at both.\n\nI won't be back."
4;Yamaaaaaa is the best buffet in Vegas. Better than Wynn, Bellagio, better than anything on the stripppp!\n\nEvery time I'm in Vegas (which mind you was A LOT), I go out of my way to find this little restaurant off of Flamingo. It's a spot for locals, not tourists, but I don't care. Amazing AYCE sushi at a reasonable price? Count me in! \n\nI live in LA and nothing even begins to come close in terms of quality and price. This place is legit. I hate waiting in lines but I'm willing to wait an hour and a half/two hours for a table. \n\nSushi does take a while to make, so order appetizers to keep you busy. I carb load here before every Vegas Marathon and it does not disappoint. \n\nI took my friend here for the first time and he almost wept by how great it was (and I know it wasn't from the wasabi!).
3;The best little chicken finger place in Las Vegas? It's Raising Cane's chicken fingers. They only have one thing on the menu but its way worth a try! When first trying Cane's I was a little skeptical of the fact they didn't have anything else on the menu except fingers and fries and the fact they didn't have ranch dipping sauce. However after trying their signature Caniac meal I knew why they only had one thing on the menu, because you wouldn't want to order anything else anyway! The Caniac comes with 6 chicken fingers, french fries, grilled texas toast bread, and Cane's special sauce. The Cane's sauce is hands down the best dipping sauce I have ever had and the Caniac is more than enough to fill me up and I can eat! If you are in Vegas and are having chick-fil-a withdrawals, unfortunately Vegas has yet to embrace the king of chicken, Raising Cane's is a quite capable replacement and you might head home wishing that there was a raising Cane's in your hometown instead!
1;I like my pedicures like I like my movies: long and satisfying.\n\nI was so excited to try this place out even though I'm happy with my usual lady, because of the fabulous reviews. I made an appointment since everybody said it can get busy, but I ended up being the only one there. I was in and out within 45 minutes (including about 10 minutes for drying time) and left quite disappointed because I don't think I got the TLC my toes needed.\n\nThe hot stone massage that everybody is raving about lasted 4 minutes total which is way less than I'm accustomed to. My toes weren't filed straight and when my big toe had a weird scuff in the polish, he just painted another 2 layers on it. I ended up going running 3 hours later and the polish apparently still wasn't dry so it got messed up and I had to repaint everything  the next day. Unfortunately, this ended up being a total waste of money.
1;On a Friday you would think that service would be quick. Went on a Friday night didn't get a drink till 45 mins later and food was decent. Pizza crust was burnt and salad was overwhelmed with bacon. Our waitress was super nice but the service was too slow.
4;I stayed here for a weekend in January for my birthday and the hotel was absolutely beautiful.  We had a superior king room and it was large with high ceilings, exposed brick, a faux fireplace, and a gorgeous bathroom.  The bathrooms in many upscale hotels (St. Regis, W) are generally tiny and unequipped and uninviting.  This bathroom was the complete opposite - showering, getting ready, and washing up were honestly pleasant experiences.  From the rainshower to the flatteringly-lit mirror to the amenities, the bathroom was the highlight of the room IMO.  I have to say I was hoping for a standalone tub, which I know the junior and exec suites have, but I was just being greedy.\n\nThe service at the hotel is worth noting.  The hotel knew from our booking that it was my birthday, and when we first got to the room, there was a bottle of sparkling wine and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries and a card from the hotel team wishing me a happy birthday.  This sort of touch makes all the difference.  Every night we were brought bottles of water and chocolates with the turn-down service.  Again, these are things I feel like most upscale hotels skimp on, but the Place D'Armes didn't.  Coming home from an entire day out walking the city to a chocolates and complimentary bottles of water (and an awesome bathroom) really does make an impact.  It shows an attentiveness to the needs of travelers in a way most other hotels say they do but there's nothing to really show for it.\n\nI would 100% stay here again during my next trip to Montreal and highly, highly recommend Hotel Place D'Armes.\n\nPS - they also gave us vouchers for complimentary cocktails at the hotel bar but since we were only there for two days and had a lot to see, we were unable to use them.  Just another example of the awesome service and ambiance!
3;"New Owners- Not very Friendly!  I have lived here for around 4 months.  I have enjoyed living here, love the apartment, enjoy the location, have had a lot of fun with the local night life and entertainment.  Recently the ownership of the building has changed.  Mark Taylor is no longer the managers of the complex.  I went down to the leasing office to drop off a rent check (Online Rent is not an option for the first month they have taken over- hopefuly it does in the future) I have to say that the people working the office are not pleasant at all.  A girl was working the desks on the phone.  I guy came out to take my check.  The girl interupted our conversation and he walked away to take a phone call; leaving me standing.  I have to say, not a very good first impression.  Man I miss my old group already.  Mark Taylor Crew Please come back and do customer service training....  Man they need it! Thanks M"
0;"Finally tried this place after all the hype. \n\nDecor and Atmosphere was nice.\n\nFood was horrible!!!!  The rolls were tiny which considering the taste was gross is probably a positive.  I was eating free \""business dinner\"" and was still shocked at the price for the roll size and quality.  They should be asham of themselves bad.\n\nI will gladly go back to my \""regular sushi joint\""  Sushi Broker's.  Great happy hour, great atmosphere and most important great food.  \n\nThis place sucks!!!"
1;Mixed review. Food was very good. Friday night met cousins after a 7 hour drive from California for a late dinner, had the chicken pot pie, was delish as was the French Dip, service was outstanding, very friendly waitress, Jill.  My father and I decided to go have breakfast on Sunday before we left home.  Big mistake, don't know if it was the owner but a lady with short bob type haircut, greeted us at the door and quickly sat us off to the left where there were no other patrons, being Mexican, my elderly father took notice quickly, I made the mistake of sitting him facing the front door and he counted and watched as the same lady sat more clients to the right where the bulk of the customers were.  Needless to say breakfast food was marred by this incident, I could see him watching as people entered and were seated with the majority, finally they sat another couple  with a child (Caucasian) behind us, but we were the only two clients sitting in the whole area, our waitress was excellent, her name escapes me now but we knew it was not her fault.  The lady with the short hair may or may not have done it intentionally, but my father felt slighted, segregated and discriminated  upon, we did not say anything but will not visit this establishment again due to this.
0;Where's the management? My husband decided to take me there for a suprise. We arrvied there around 2 pm on a Sunday to a very empty parking lot. We arrived inside to find a large party. There was no direction for someone who has never been there. On top of that, the party had stragglers filter in, so of course they nonchalantly cut in line because they were there for the party. It should not work that way. We found a mix of 2 lines where we had no idea where we were supposed to be. After standing in line for an hour, the couple in front of us approached the counter to find out there was a 2 hour wait for a race. We didn't even wait to get to the counter before we said enough of this. There was no management around and found the laziness of the employees. We were disappointed in this place, but it's not really like one complaints going to hurt this. I just hope they learn how to be more effective at their operations and their customer service. You can train employees how to facilitate operations and when groups are known to come in, have them have a specific point of contact so the rest of us don't have to suffer for because we're not in their group.
4;My second visit here (Wednesday half-off rib night!) and the waitress Drea greeted us with the same beers that we both drank last week! What a great waitress!  The ribs are well cooked, with a tasty baked-on sauce that isn't overpowering.  The meat falls off the bones just the way I like it and the sweet potato fries are a new favorite. Lots of tv's and a little noisy, but the outside seats were filled so...can't wait for next Wednesday!
3;What a great visit! I've been driving by this plaza for quite a long time now and an impromptu date night led us to finally give West End Bar & Grill a try. Boy am i glad we did! \n\nNestled in a back corner of the lot behind Goodwill, it's definitely off the beaten track. You can't see it from the street, you have to pull in to the lot and head to the southeast corner of the back lot. And don't let the golf carts out front fool you--this place is BIG, FUN, and not just for the Geriatric crowd of Sun City West!\n\nWe enjoyed the wings for an appetizer. The wings were big and meaty with a nice crunchy coating.  I enjoyed the Veggie sandwich which was a portabello mushroom sandwich with mozzarella cheese and mixed greens on flat bread. It had a great pesto and balsamic dressing as well. It was EXCELLENT. My husband had the special which was a taco salad with a FREE margarita or beer. He had the marg. The taco salad was just the right size, fresh, and plenty meaty. We also had dessert--a lemon bar sundae. Everything was really very good. \n\nOur server was friendly, interesting, and not intrusive at all. The other staff members were also friendly as well when they worked near our table, checking on us and removing plates as needed.  \n\nI am really looking forward to going back to West End. This place is a diamond in the rough here in Surprise and supporting small, local businesses whenever possible is what I'm all about!
1;Mediocre bar with nothing special.  No food in house, they hand you menus. Bad.\n\nOne star was for the impossibly hot waitress who obviously doesn't realize she should be stripping for 50x's the money instead of working at that place.
4;Awesome experience! My husband, 6 year old and 2 year old all got the best haircuts. It was my 2 year olds first haircut and Jimmy and his wife made it magical. Could not ask for a better neighborhood barber!
4;I am new to the waxing scene and was very nervous.  Before my recent tropical vacation, I chose to visit Elevation because I had heard great things about their waxing specialist, Katie.  Everything I heard was true- she is phenomenal!!!  She instantly put me at ease with her friendly yet professional nature.  She was funny, caring, and so patient with me.  Even better, she did an amazing job and I left beyond satisfied with my brazilian.  Over a week later, my ladybits are as tidy as when I left.  \n\nThe salon itself is beautiful, clean, and perfectly tucked away into Madison's capitol neighborhood.  The front desk staff is so sweet and helpful, and I can't wait to try other procedures at this full-service spa&salon.  And I have no desire to ever be waxed by anyone but Katie, ever again!!
0;Worst place I've ever been to    No service or women. I would never come in this place ever again.  Women are not attractive and staff is even worse.\n\nBeer is almost $8 with no girls in sight.  What a joke.  This place is the worst place I've ever been to and I've been all over the world.
4;We passed by and read the menu on our way back to the Wynn from a day of shopping. We thought, hey, this place sounds good. So we ate here for breakfast the next morning. \n\nEverything tasted great - the fresh fruit platter, OJ, Coffee, my Filet Mignon Bfast Sliders! The food quantity on the plate was just right and it tasted awesome!\n\nAfter reading other reviews, I will definitely have to add this place to my list for lunch or dinner, or both!
0;"I have lived in Vegas for now over a year, and I have to say that by far this was the worst restaurant I have been too. \n\nWhen we first came in it looked fun, loud, dark - perfect for a younger crowd looking to have some fun. We decided to sit outside because Vegas weather is to be enjoyed as much as possible and were quickly concerned by the size of the menu. \n\nI have never seen a menu this large. Yes 2 pages are of the brews that they have on tap but the other 5 pages (back and front) are of food they serve. They serve pizza, soup, salad, vegetarian, tacos, fish, sushi, dessert, sandwiches, burgers, pasta EVERYTHING. This is when I got nervous. Usually when I see a menu over 2 pages I'm wondering if they're a \""Jack of all trades and a King of NONE.\"" As I looked through the menu every item had this grandiose listing of ingredients that looked as if they belonged in a high end restaurant. As far as I knew I was in a restaurant that cherished beer and was named the \""YARD HOUSE\"". It was obvious that they were overcompensating or just flat out LYING about what they put in their food. After reading a novel of a menu for over 10 minutes I thought I had finally decided what I wanted. I ordered a ranch side salad and their \""famous\"" mac n cheese. My husband ordered a BBQ burger - well done with french fries. We did not order any brew. \n\nWhen they brought out my salad I was surprised to see that they had used a hot plate to serve my cold salad. It did not help the taste. The lettuce itself was very weak and not crunchy at all like Iceberg lettuce generally is. After eating a few bites I saw something dark and shiny in the bottom of my bowl...I began to dig it out and realized that it was a long thin dark black hair. I stopped eating. \n\nA few minutes after I stopped eating I asked for our waitress to take the salad away due to the hair and she apologized and asked if I would like something else instead. Just to be safe I ordered the Caesar salad. The salad quickly came out within two minutes and I was excited to try it because I LOVE Caesar dressing. I took a huge bite and for some reason my nose and my pallete tasted and smelled something skunky...I had assumed it may have been the man who had just walked by and continued to take another bite. After that bite I knew it was the dressing. The Yard House had tried to \""remake\"" caesar dressing and it was awful. It tasted like someone had just rubbed their dirty gym sock all over my salad. I didn't take another bite.\n\n\n\nShortly after that our meals had arrived and as I am the BIGGEST mac and cheese fan I was super excited to taste their rendition of an old favorite. They had used some \""fancy\"" pasta with a few different cheeses, chicken, bacon, mushrooms and a bread crumble on top. The cheese sauce was good, the pasta itself was way overcooked and too soft, the bacon was soft..which was not appealing and some of the chicken was cold as if they had frozen slices and just heated them for the dish. I pushed everything but the pasta and the cheese to the side and tried to enjoy it. After a couple of bites I started to feel really sick. I'm not really sure what caused it but I honestly felt like I was going to throw up. It might have had something to do with the fact that a few seconds before the table next to us OUTSIDE had ordered fish and I was drowning in bad fish odor at our table. My husband even complained of the stench. That fish was IN NO WAY FRESH. It smelt like rotten salmon that had been sitting under a heat lamp all day. I almost gagged when they first brought it out. I think that, and the combo of feeling like I ate a dirty sock and soft pasta may have made me sick. \n\n\nMy husband said that his burger was alright, and the fries were okay, but really stringy. \n\nHalfway into eating my mac and cheese a woman came out to speak to me about the hair that I had found in my salad. She let me know that it was NOT a hair, and that it was actually corn silk, left over from the \""fresh\"" corn they had just chucked to make my salad. I've eaten fresh corn, canned corn and frozen corn all of my life. They have very distinct differences. I know, that that was frozen corn. It was gooey and hard to chew, fresh corn just pops in your mouth. I don't know why anyone had come out to argue with me about what I found in my salad. Last time I chucked corn the silk was usually white to a yellowish color. Not BLACK. Nice try though.\n\n\n\nAnyway, my husband and I both left feeling very nauseous and the drive back to Henderson was NOT a pleasant one. The entire drive home I was trying my hardest not to throw up. I don't want to explain what the rest of my night was like but I'm sure you get the picture. We wont be back here."
1;I always get excited to try new places that pop up.  The menu looked great (although a bit pricey for what it is), but what really drew me here was the lure of sweet potato fries.  I'm a sucker for them.  So we hopped on the lunch train and headed here.  Luckily, we were the first people there for lunch, so the wait was not an issue.  From there, annoying things kept popping up.\n\nAnnoying thing #1:  You have to tell them that you want the regular burger stuff when you order your burger (onions, lettuce, tomato, etc.).  I'm just so used to that being standard that when my burger arrived without its usual accoutrements, it threw me for a loop.\n\nAnnoying thing #2: $12 for a burger, drink, and S.P. fries?  Seems steep.\n\nAnnoying thing #3: I asked for a burger sans bun.  They put the burger on the little paper square thing, which would be fine if you aren't eating with a fork.  But you are if you don't have a bun, and then halfway through your burger, you realize you've been eating tiny bits of paper.  Uncool.\n\nI might give it another shot and maybe try the wings, but for burgers and s.p. fries, I'll stick with College Place.
4;"\""Where the eff is 115?!\"" \nThis was an overused phrase while walking up and down Laurier looking for Baldwin Barmacie as the store numbers got bigger and smaller at random. I was determined to find this place though because out of all the pre-trip research I did, Baldwin Barmacie was on my \""must see\"" list. \n\nVisiting Montreal for the weekend and wanting to get out of the main tourist spots, my friend and I decided to make the trek to the Miles End-ish neighborhood. After a wrong turn off the Metro, a failed attempt at bar #1, hands and noses that were chilled to the core and the frustration of actually finding the place, once the bar was in sight, I knew right from the entrance that I was going to like it. \n\nBalwin Barmaice made me feel right at home, this place could easily be found on South Beach (minus the mandatory $2 coat check), offering a casual yet trendy vibe where the clientele were upscale and the decor streamlined with a gimmicky twist, using retro bottles to mimic old fashioned pharmaceutics and unique lighting and chandeliers which casted a romantic glow on the place. At 9:30, Baracie was already picking up and seats were in high demand. My friend and I were able to score 2 stools at the bar where a number of bar tenders came to our service. \n\nThe menu was in an english/french hybrid, but the waitstaff was affable and happy to answer any of our questions. I ended up ordering some mac n' cheese complimented with a peach bellini and my bestie got a grilled cheese with a \""miss Baldwin\"" which was some sort of strawberry vodka mixed with something refreshing. The food was yummy and hit the spot. My drink was a tad on the small side, but tasty nonetheless. My friend's cocktail was delish and a good size. I don't think either drink was all that strong; I'm a lightweight and usually it only takes one cocktail to make me feel the alcohol swirling around my brain. Didn't feel a thing here though. \n\nBalwin Barmacie offers a great atmosphere and fair prices, their drinks could use some more conviction but all in all a really great spot!"
2;"I'd like to say something about the food but can't. Last time I was there, we were sat at a table and then ignored for 15 minutes - and then we left.\n\nI marked it 3 stars because it's what they're already ranked at now and I don't want to actually damage their ranking. Like I said, I haven't had the food, so it would be ignorant to give it any kind of star ranking - maybe the food is actually good; I would have loved to have found out, but again - *ignored* by wait staff for 15 minutes."
0;"Yet another example of \""Check Yelp before eating here\""...after waiting thirty minutes to get our food and receiving a bagel sandwich that seemed to have been soaked in grease, I logged on to Yelp to check what others say about the place.  If only I had looked before!  Service was slow (when there was any service), and the food was awful. Do NOT bother with this place.  Walk on by...."
4;"We were headed to Vegas for a family reunion, and I was not thrilled that my brother chose \""The Clown Hotel\"" for us to stay at, especially since we all left our kids at home. However, I was impressed with the hotel. The room was very nice (we stayed in the West Tower), the beds were super comfy, and all of the employees we encountered were wonderful. \n\nI stupidly left some personal articles in the room after checkout (including $100 in cash!), and the hotel called to let me know, then graciously mailed them to me. All I had to pay was mailing costs. \n\nI would have no reservations about staying here in the future. The Midway was fun, the hotel had plenty of activities going on (be sure to check out Vince Neils Tatuado!), and we had a great time. I highly recommend the hotel, since I had an amazing experience."
2;For the price, we've had way better.  We didn't like the atmosphere.  On the up side, the service was great.
2;Awesome food... Not so awesome prices. You're looking at like ten bucks a person, and no matter how you make it, it's a grilled cheese. But if you're like me and you throw cost to the wind to try something unique, this is where you do it. Great food, unique recipes, and killer desserts.
1;Just ate there with my wife, so it was only the two of us. We made reservations, however, they were not needed, as we were the only people there. I hate being the only person in a restaurant, but I would imagine even more, the restaurant hates it when there is only one table occupied. (By the time we left, there was one other.) Anyway, it is a fairly small place in a small strip mall type environment. The prices are high, very high, the food is all labled in Italian, which I can't stand. You now have to read the description of most everything because who the hell knows Italian. Anyway, I ordered Chcken Parm, sort of what I almost always order when dining Italian, and my wife got some mixture of Shrimp, greens and pasta. Being and aficianado of Chicken Parm, I was quite surpised that all that was on my plate was a piece of chiken...usually there is a side of pasta...in fact always there is, until now. So $24 bucks for a chiken breast. My wifes was about $24 also. Anyway, food was OK, mine was very salty. The bill for only two was over $70 with tip. Honestly, I would not return. There are a few good Italian joints in Henderson, with better food and better prices. Also, service, which was prompt enough (we WERE the only ones there!)...finding any personalty or friendliness from the guys there was non-existant.
2;5 star coffee, easily the best coffee in the whole valley. The service has gotten much better. It used to be where the baristas were total snobs, and looked down upon you. I think maybe you need to be a hipster to get smile and good service. A paying customer who loves good coffee isn't good enough. But like I said, they are much more cordial now. I would go more often, but I don't like the dungeon dark feeling in the place. They should open that back more, add some natural light ambience. It takes forever to get your coffee, but its fresh and delicious. Coffee 5 stars, everything else, 1 to 2, Therefore a 3 star rating.
2;Good variety on the menu (at least as far as non-traditional rolls go ... the deep fried stuff, the gajillion combinations, etc).  Came at a strange time (end of lunch) and service was good.  Sushi was not bad, but not great.\n\nI would say this came across as a reasonable sushi option ... I doubt you'll go truly wrong here, but there are better to be found in South Charlotte.
3;Food - Great!\nPortions - small !\nLine - long )-:\nFresh !\nAll an All - Great sandwich place !\nVery recommended !
4;This is absolutely one of my favorite places to go! Their happy hour has great choices! I love their rolls and dessert. Their cinnamon tempura is amazing. Their service is awesome. Waiters were very friendly and always recommended the most tasting appetizers, course meals, and desserts. The place itself is beautiful and different. Also, signing up for them is a good idea. You get special offers and birthday gifts from them! The manager, I don't know his name, but he is very kind and sweet to his customers. Always making them feel welcome!
3;CUTE CUTE CUTE shop has a little something for everyone and prices for everyone too.  It's a mish mosh of things, jewelry, laptop cases, purses, shoes clothing, knick knacks.\n\nStaff is really cool too.
2;Very nice and modern view external facade. Great  SMoCA - Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art that can be visited without there being an event. Quiet garden spot in the upper floor. The position is not quite adequate in the center of the old Scottsdale, Council a snack in the old market nearby at truly Cheap
0;"I went in today to pick out a puppy for my husband's birthday.  I knew I wanted a maltese or poodle mix, and asked about the two females near the front of the store (apricot malti-poo, chocolate shitzu-poo). The employee (older white female, red hair) let me see the chocolate in a private room. I fell in love with her, but she wasn't \""ready to go home\"" today. When I asked why she wasn't ready and when she might be, the employee was extremely defensive and rude.  I tried to clarify when I could buy her, and was repeatedly told, \""I ALREADY told you, she's just not ready yet.\"" Very disappointed, because this baby girl would have been the perfect fit for our family. I informed another employee about the rude behavior of the older lady, and she apologized, although she didn't seem very surprised."
4;A group of friends and I ate here our first night in Vegas just because it was late and convenient (we were staying at the hotel). What a great surprise. The food here is absolutely delicious. It was so good that we came back each night for the rest of our stay. Everything all of us ordered during the three nights was excellent. The first night one of the specials was sea bass with livornese sauce, and if I remember correctly, four of the five of us ordered it. The fish was cooked perfectly, slightly crispy on the outside and flaky on the inside, and the sauce was rich and flavorful. During the next two nights we worked our way through more of the menu. Everything we tried was delicious, from the appetizers to the desserts. The wine selection is excellent too. The service is warm and personable, and the prices are reasonable.\n\nEspecially in a city of overpriced restaurants with mediocre food, Tuscany Gardens is a real find, and worth going out of your way to visit.
4;The expanded menu suits the expanded seating area! Try the pulled pork poutine, the cone of fries with homemade beer mayo, cheese plates, even the veggie burger is not shabby. Cure for the sads: try a shot of Sortilege and espresso, served up by beloved folk singer Mike O'Brien. After this, nothin can touch you.
2;There's the actual dine in place and also an area outside where you could order food.  The first time I ordered the frozen hot chocolate (from outside), it was amazing!! The second time I ordered it, it was just okay.  Tasted more like ice.  If you order from outside, they give it to you in a plastic cup, but if you order inside, the presentation is pretty and it costs a little more.\n\nTo dine in,  I gave my phone number to the hostess and she was able to text me when my table was ready.  I found this convenient, and the wait was only 15 minutes long.  It took quite a long time for our food to come out, but I understand that the kitchen was busy.  Our server was very friendly and accommodating.\n\nI went on a Sunday morning and Brunch is served until 2am.  You can't order off the regular menu.  Dessert was also being served.\n\nI ordered the fried eggs benedict.  It was alright but I wasn't completely satisfied with it.      The egg is kind of hard boiled.  I was hoping for it to have more sauce.  The biscuit was good but it was lacking in the other sauces so it made it seem a little dry.  \n\nFor desert, I got the can't say no sundae.  I LOVED it.  The humble pie in it is yummy and rich in flavor.  It goes well with the ice cream.
3;Quite the experience. Expect a line. Worth the wait.
0;"Went in tonight for the Turkey dinner, and chicken fried steak. Chicken fried steak was \""soggy\"", and tasted horrible. 2 Turkey dinners, and both dishes were served cold. The only thing somewhat edible, was the coleslaw, as it tastes fine when cold. To add to the experience, the Chicken Fired steak was served exactly how I asked it NOT to be, and the mashed potatoes for the 2 Turkey dinners never showed up. The waiter never refilled my Wife's drink, no checked to see if she needed a refill. I asked 3 different times for condiments for the sides, only to receive them after I asked the third time. The kitchen staff, and management are clearly over taxed on anything more than 10% occupancy. we couldn't count the number of people who were in line with complaints over their orders. I WILL NOT ever consider going to this place again."
2;This place was cheap, and that's why we stayed there. And that's all there was to say about that. It looks a bit old and you can tell when you stay there. \n\nWhen i tried to take a shower, my hands hit the ceiling. wtf? I'm not that tall! really i'm not!\n\nI had a great view of the Imperial Palace and parking lot next door. Its got a good location, as its on the strip and I didn't have to walk far to get to places. The staff was friendly. \n\nVegas has hard water, and its dry so your skin will freak out. The lotion that they gave did nothing. Their shampoo sucked. But they cleaned the room every day. \n\nThe flamingos they had there outside were good for taking pictures. They had swans and a few other animals there. Take some more pictures. \n\nDonnie and Marie were playing there, so we made sure not to be there at night. Its a good location, near the Bellagio and it was cheap, so go with that if you're strapped for cash.
1;"I love the decor and there's a pretty fountain in it.   But you know what threw me off on this place?  The guys manning the carts.\n\nThere was some guy that tried to sell me a solar charger while I was trying to text my cousin, and when I said \""no thanks\"", he yells .... OH HO..... I SEE.... or something and causes a ruckus.\n\nI mean, seriously.   It's one thing to be in sales, but it's another to be an annoyance.\n\nOverall, there's quite a few food choices that anchor the place, and there's a Fat Tuesday (slushie alchie drinks) that I know people go bananas for but outside of that, it's a pretty typical mall area.\n\nThe signage was pretty terrible.  I was in self-parking, and it took me two looks at separate directories to find Planet Hollywood since I didn't know the area and never been there before.   Then going back, it was the same.  They should have large signage that actually directs you towards areas just as any other mall.  It's almost as they don't want you to get to your destination.\n\nSaving grace of this place?  Earl of Sandwich."
0;Long 4 hour wait and rude disrespectful miserable staff. People do not deserve to be treated like crap just because you hate your life and your job. I don't understand how the DMV has been around this long and still can't manage how to move things in the right direction on having a better system on how run things. Will never be going back here to this location again.
3;"I could see this place being the BEST invention in the world after partying at one of the clubs at SLS. \n\nOur table ordered two different burgers (one turkey, one beef), French toast, and eggs with potatoes. Food here is pretty big. Not Hash House big, but still massive. French toast was two slices bigger than my friend's face, and burgers came with a pound or two of potato wedges. The Mama Mia burger was tasty with a garlic sauce, mozzarella, and a roasted bell pepper with great flavor! The turkey burger was hailed as \""real good\"" as well. My recommendation is to finish the burger first with just a few fries here and there so you don't get full trying to conquer the tower of pre-frozen potato wedges. That or bring really big (or really drunk) friends. \n\nService was not particularly outstanding, but I feel like it's one of those hit or miss situations. The server that took the order and brought the drinks wasn't actually assigned that table, and the actual server didn't ever stop by. So we never got refills or checked on once the food came out.\n\nPrices are $13 on average for entrees. A solid drunken meal, hands down. Sober it's good too, though probably not a first on the list with a limited amount of time in Vegas. If you're with a family, maybe split an entree between every two people, and your breakfast tab should still come out affordable with full bellies."
0;Not very good at all.  I stayed at the hotel and that was a great experience.  I was really looking forward to the buffet, I knew it wasn't going to be 4 star dining but I expected more out of this place, it didn't have the greatest selection and the food had no flavor.  I would never go back.  Please take my word for it, don't try the sushi...
1;Really this is suppose to be a hot new restaurant!?! The food was mediocre at best. all the food was wet. Not with sauce just wet like they forgot to drain the water out.\n\nThe Girls dancing/walking couldn't help but stare at themselves in the mirror the whole time they were on the runway and to top it off our waiter was poring water and ice came out too fast and shatter at our table and all over my fianc\u00e9e and he didn't even offer to comp us a drink or anything. Pretty lame experience.
3;Pizza is their strength.
4;If this club is actually closed, its a sad day for vegas...one of the best clubs I have ever been in the US, Bunnies galore, probably the closest I'll ever get to one again, and the best dance club/view in the city...balling.
3;Let me preface this by saying that I just got off a plane and was starving and my friends had been rock climbing all day and probably would have thought a Slim Jim was the best thing they ever tasted.\n\nWhen you arrive, you will think you are in the wrong place.  It's in a crazy seedy strip mall and at night I had trouble picking this restaurant out of the string of strange establishments.  It was so dark that I thought they were closed (none of the strip mall's neon lights were on), but then I saw an open sign.\n\nInside it is nicer.  Huge wine selection.  On the menu there is an entree specialty section priced in the +$20 range, but the standard menu has lots of options under $10.  My 3 friends and I got 4 entrees and two beers for under $50.\n\nI may get crap for it, but I always order pad thai as a backup when at a new thai restaurant because it's usually edible, even if the other stuff you order is not.  Everything we ordered (cashew nut chicken, lemon pepper pork, yellow curry, pad thai) was great, but I was surprised that the pad thai was phenomenal. \n\nThe guys in the group were scraping every last peppercorn off the dish.  I had to practically stop them from licking the plates!\n\nEven if we were biased by hunger, I have had marginal thai food before.  This place was fantastic and I would definitely go back.
3;love the noodle soups!
2;"The food was \""OK\"". It has great reviews so we decided to try it out. We had some tuna with mash potatoe appetizer sprinkled with raw onions and a green sauce.  That was good! The steak and plantains were pretty greasy and it actually made my stomach hurt for a couple days. I don't think I'd recommend this just cause if the grease but if you can handle it then it's a must try."
4;The Rack is my favorite place to shop.  This Arrowhead store is great, because it is better organized than other Rack locations.  It is easy to figure out where things are located and sizes almost always in the correct location.  Highly recommend
4;"This place was a surprise. I got a Groupon for a dinner and a show and was not expecting much at all. I especially wasn't expecting superb service and gourmet food! This place is outstanding. Even without the Groupon, the prices are very humble. Everything we got was delicious.\n\nWe were seated immediately as it was not very crowded on a Monday night. \nOur server was cool. He looked like the sidekick from Quantum Leap. Very attentive and helpful with the menu. He recommended the Scallpos for an appetizer and we were sure glad he did. They were phenomenal. Biggest scallops in the ocean onto my plate, seared perfectly with a miso butter sauce that was divine.\n\nWarm spinach and bacon salad was delicious. Just wish it was bigger for sharing. My wife got mad that I ate it all so quick. \n\nIf you have the word steak in your restaurant in Vegas, you have a lot of pressure to deliver. R Steak & Seafood did just that. Porterhouse was cooked perfectly and tons of great flavors. \n\nSo I thought with a Groupon, the drinks would be like \""Vegas specials\"". Wrong. Good size drinks with good pours."
2;"Looks can be deceiving and with this mall, it's deceiving. \n\nEdgy. Chic. Beautiful. Big. Those are my first impressions of this mall. \n\nParking is a bi**. Too crowded to walk. Rude shoppers. Nothing is in stock. The reality of this mall - Not my idea of a peaceful shopping experience.\n\nIf you're bored and not really trying to shop for anything in particular, this is a great place to people (tourist) watch and kill precious (valuable) time - but it's not my first pick of malls in Las Vegas. Parking is terrible on the weekends. Props to having the only Nordstrom in Vegas, but it's not even a big Nordie, it's rather petite. I'll still enjoy driving a little bit further to the local's paradise, that is the Galleria Mall. ;)\n\n*edit - pop up runway show? Sounds interesting. I guess I'll have to come back to experience it and report back."
3;Fried leeks are now one of my most favorite things to eat!\n\nThe meatloaf hash was not as delicious or full of flavor as I had hoped. It grew on me over time, though.\n\nThe chicken and waffles is very impressive. I'll probably get that next time. :)
3;Yummy toasted sandwiches. Had turkey and chedder on whole wheat. They were out of the broccoli cheddar soup which I was super bummed about. Maybe next time. The great thing is they deliver! I live right in the neighborhood so its nice for a change.
3;Good times!!\nI have been to the Aruba for several different events. Now this location is damn near the butt-hole of Vegas but luckily I am always there for a event where i am with a bunch of friends and 3 sheets to the wind.\nThis is obviously thee place to have some quirky, cool, hip,retro events.\nI been here for the Atomic Frolic they had in January ..actually had a room there WHICH rooms are blahhhhhhh. You could hear everyone's biz through the walls I mean if someone cracks ass 3 rooms down..you will hear it!! The floors have cheapy 5 cents a square fake tile flooring, beds are old, sinks runs, toilet flushes some of the time..I could go on but the rooms are just fine when it is 5am and your completely waisted and everyone else you know is all staying at the same hotel. \nThe time I went in January it was a blast, plenty of room and seats, cool people, great friendly bartenders, nice staff it was a blast.\nSecond time I went was the following month for a Scooter (vespa) Rally and their night event was held at the Aruba. It was fun once again HOWEVER, The security guards did not let anyone smoke inside..which for Vegas is strange and me being a smoker (and from CA) was a little disappointing.\nAnyway I am going back again at the end of the month for a HUGE 60's Soul and Garage weekender for Labor day weekend. Not looking forward to the seedy room but looking for Lots of fun and great cheap drinks and lots of memories!!\n\nFour stars simply just for being so accomodating to all those fun retro quirky events that I like to go too and just for that ol Vegas feel.\n\nOh and SPA...never seen it...be cool to find it and try it.\nOh and if in Vegas dont expect a cabby to know where this place is...seriously most of them have no clue unless it's downtown or the strip.
3;Traditional and delicious food. Really neat restaurant that used to be a church.
4;"I love chick-fil-a and I really wish they were in New York. The prices are completely reasonable and the quality of food is so good! It would put McDonalds to shame. \n\nTheir chicken nuggets and strips are so fresh it honestly gets me every time. Additionally, the chick-fil-a sauce is a must try! They have also come out with a honey mustard BBQ sauce which I have to admit is better than the chick-fil-a sauce! I didnt think it was possible but it is. I used to mix the chick-fil-a sauce and BBQ and now with this new sauce they kind of did it for you. Anybody who has been here and tried the chick-fil-a sauce knows why its such a big deal, especially to claim there is something better! \n\nThe staff here was really nice. I found it funny because one of the girls asked us right away where we were from. We answered NY and an employee asked \""Why are you here\"" which my friends and I thought was hilarious. And of course like the New Yorkers we are we teased her for a little like \""should we go back\"" \""you don't want us\"" She seemed to be really embarrassed so playing around with her seemed to ease her up.\n\nOverall, one of my favorite fast food places."
2;It's exhausting to walk just about anywhere in Vegas and traveling from one end of the Forums to the other is no exception but there are plenty of restaurants along the way (and even center kiosks for booze, oxygen, and desserts) to re-charge your batteries - however you might choose.\n\nSelection of stores seem to run the gamut - from low end retailers like an H&M where you can pick up a tshirt for $6 to others where I hope you won more at the tables than I did, and everything in between.\n\nIf all else fails - at least in true Vegas style - it's a visually pleasing backdrop poorly attempting to transport you half way around the world but at least transporting you away from the street vendors for a second.
1;The line was long to get in for a Friday (2/20).  The employees openly talked about their frustrations to one another while checking us in.  TACKY!  Save it for the break room ladies.  I don't need to hear about how your Manager made you come out and help.. ME! \n\nWhat can I say?  It was a basic room.  Queen bed my eye though.  We were like sardines in there.  But what do you expect in Vegas.  The 2 rooms were about $320 for 2 nights.  The bathrooms don't have fans.  A bit odd.  We had to open the doors while showering to let the steam out.  The only cool thing was the iron and ironing board in the room.  The were doing construction on the pool area when we went.  Might want to check that out before booking your stay.  And they are dead serious on cut off being 4 p.m. for the pool.  You can't even get in there to see what it looks like cause they lock the doors.  Oh, and it's $30 for late check-out.  No courtesty hour here!
4;Large portions, excellent food! We attended their opening and were pleasantly surprised at the portions of food. Each dish we ordered was fabulous but my personal favorite was the pork tenderloin. I'm ashamed to say, I ate the whole thing! \nAmbiance couldn't be better. The lighting is perfect and the noise level not to loud considering the open space.\n\nTheir hours are fm 11am to late night....1:00am. Except Sunday they are only open for dinner. \n\nThis is a must try at least once, but I'm sure you'll be hooked. I'm going back next week to try their salads for lunch.\n\nIf you live up north/DC Ranch Area, also consider trying their sister restaurant Local Bistro. Everything there is fabulous as well but my two favorites are their burger and chicken dishes.
1;Came here while in town visiting a relative and wanting to get some sushi together.  This place was a huge disappointment.  The place was overpriced and left me with a not so fresh feeling.  I dont recall everything that I had, but when you spend money on sushi, which I have no problem doing, you expect to get what you paid for.  At this place I felt I would have been better off going to a local grocery store and getting some of their crap sushi, because at least then I would have wasted less money.
2;I've had better. The rumor mill around this place seduces you, then you get there and you have a taste and you're like what the hell was the hype about? Yeah, it is good coffee. The product is nice. But seriously, nothing to freak out about. It is your standard independent coffee shop that makes an espresso you'll be glad to drink. I won't go out of my way for it but when I'm around the location, I'm glad its there. A solid good choice.
0;"Wow...I've never experienced such rude customer service at a vegas hotel! This used to be my go-to hotel, regardless of the things I have heard from people, but NO MORE. Yeah the rooms are decent...but if you are not a family with kids, this is not the hotel for you.\n\n1. 3 STRIKES AND YOURE OUT! if you get 3 noise complaints...they kick you out and do not give you back any of your money! in fact...they CHARGE you more for the inconvenience you have caused! It was one person's 21st birthday and he got noise complaints during the day from the room next door = busted. I was playing music from my phone in the bathroom during mid day, ALSO got a noise complaint. really? I think outside on the strip has louder noise then the \""ruckus\"" i was causing.\n\n2. $250 FLAT RATE CHARGE for smoking/ANY TRASH left in room! We left our trash in trash bags by the door and left our towels in a pile in the bathroom..and apparently that was so disgusting for the cleaning lady that we had to get $250 charge and no way to argue it. they sent us the pics...and trust me that was clean compared to some of the rooms i have seen. I even left a $20 tip! just cause we didnt get room service for one day [which they charged me $15 for], the room was deemed too messy. \n\n3. $15 random charge for room service! umm what? is that not included? and i left a tip that was more than what they charged. \n\n4. washer/dryer has a 40 min timer and you can not remove your clothes until the time runs out. my friend's clothes were literally LOCKED in the entire night. we called room service, they said there was nothing they could do. we turned the machine off and back on...still locked. we stopped the cycle...STILL locked. needless to say, hes lucky someone else had extra clothes he could borrow for the night.\n\nLESSON LEARNED. if you want to have a good time in vegas and not get charged for random things, STAY AWAY."
0;For picks up on the street Atlas is your best bet drivers are kind and polite IF you know where you are going. \n\nI wouldn't bother calling the dispatch for a cab if you are visiting and are calling from a non local number- dispatch can't contact you and cabbies won't ring their fares once they arrive at their destination. \n\nYmmv
3;In the age old war between Zaba's and Chipotle, Zaba's always wins out for me.  So much so that while the Eastern location which is closest to me is closed down in preparation of a new location opening soon, I drove all the way to this location instead of just settling for the Chipotle down the street.   That's partially not true as I was somewhat in the area before deciding to get some take-out for lunch, but it was definitely much less convenient than going the Chipotle route and dammit I still took it.\n\nThis location seemed much nicer aesthetically than any other Zaba's I've been to.   That's not to say that they usually aren't nice because they are, but something about this one just seemed a step ahead.   It was packed for lunch but the employees were on top of their game in within a few minutes I was out the door with a couple Zaba Bowls to go.   \n\nI did my usual, a zaba bowl with brown rice, shredded beef, corn, green salsa, and lettuce.   It's about as healthy a meal I can put together at any of these fresh-mex joints that I can still enjoy.   I found it to be a good version of the same thing I've gotten 100 times at the Eastern location.   The shredded beef was nicely spiced (I've had it on occasion lack spiciness which I believe is due to it not being stewed long enough to soak it all in) and the veggies were fresh and as tasty as veggies can be.   My rice was a little mushier than I normally like it, so that was my only minor gripe.   I also shared a bag of chips and they were spot on as usual.   \n\nA good value became even better recently with the introduction of the Zaba's reward card with which every 10 entrees purchased you get the 11th free.   Points are doubled on Sundays.   Since I go to the other location at least 2-3 times a week and buy for 2, I average a free entree every 2-3 weeks.   WHAT HAS CHIPOTLE DONE FOR ME LATELY?   Exactly.
4;Andrea is an artist when it comes to shaping your eyebrows to naturally match with the shape and flow of your face. She has a gentle touch but gets all of the hair, which I appreciate! No lingering labia or booty hair with the Brazilian.
0;"So my boyfriend got orders for the military a couple months ago and trusted me enough to leave his car in my hands.  I decided to surprise him with an oil change and just simply top off all the fluids in his car.  I chose Purrfect Auto because I noticed that they were having an \""Oil Change Special\"" for something like $15.  A gentleman, who seemed to be an owner or manager, accepted the vehicle and told me it would take about 15 minutes.  I decided to get some fries at PT's while I waited, but 5 minutes later got a phone call from them.  They told me my boyfriend's oil hadn't been changed for a long time and recommended an engine flush.  Of course, this wasn't without giving me a LIST of things that needed immediate repair - to which I later took the car in to a different location that verified these \""needed repairs\"" were all *BS.  I agreed to just the added engine flush and was told it would be another 15 minutes.\n\nAfter waiting for about an hour, they finally finished and presented me with a $70 bill.  So much for that \""$15 Oil Change Special\"".  When I asked him why so pricey, he told me that he wouldn't get into the technicalities of it, but he gave me the best quality oil which is 5W-30.  (For those who do not know much about cars, this says NOTHING about the quality of the oil.  This is the TYPE of oil this particular car is SUPPOSED to have - per manufacturer.)  Anyways, my boyfriend came back only two days afterwards and looked under the hood.  Everything was dry - No oil was added, let alone changed, whatsoever!!\n\nDO NOT go here.  Save your CAR, save your TIME, save your MONEY.  The mechanics who work here should be ashamed to work with such low/no ethics or even call themselves mechanics!  If these negative reviews on Yelp are not enough to convince you this place is a scam, check news segments on Youtube."
4;The location is not all that great but when you walk in they are welcoming people. My husband daughter and I walked in for a pedicure they Kept my daughter busy while we did our treatment. THEY ARE SOOOOO GOOD WITH IN GROWN TOE NAILS.(my husband had a few) every time I visit arizona this is my nail place to go. Defenetly recommend it. The prices are so inexpensive 15 dollar pedicures with 3 dollar callus remover.
3;If you love their ice cream this is the only place you can get a served scoop in a cone in the greater Phoenix area. I made the drive which is a long one from central Scottsdale and extreme from much of the Valley of the Sun. It was nice to enjoy the ice cream. It is a great product and I think it is superior to any other. This is not a full size store. It is in a shopping center that seems to be suffering. I hope it survives. I haven't been for a few months.
0;Greasiest pizza I've ever tried.  Couldn't even eat it because the grease soaked through the crust and it was falling apart.  I'm from NY and I would rather eat nasty chain store pizza over this stuff!
2;Meh...it's just ok at this point. \n\nPerhaps the problem is that I've never actually gone into the place. I received the whole menu through the mail and I was intrigued so I went on the website and I've ordered from their a handful of times. Each time I try something new to get some variety. Their crab dip was...questionable. I tasted fishier than it should have. The calzones are pretty good...not enought filling though. I tried their spaghetti bake and it was good but too much sauce even though I specified light sauce. It's good but there always seems to be something off about it. I'll try going in next time so they can redeem themselves!
0;"Interesting experience.\n\nRooms are clean and simple.\n\nCasino floor, riddled with robotic people, staring at the slot machine wheel, ashtray overflowing.  \n\nHeaded from my room,  saw what appeared to be police officer come out of a room, accompanied by uh...a rather interesting woman.  Rode the elevator down, and it turned out to be a hotel security guard with a prostitute.  He was boasting about himself, mentioned a chap named Jose who hooked them up eith the room. \n\nLater while killing time at the bar, the lady of the night was trolling the bar for clients.\n\nSo, the good news, Boulder Station requires thorough \""back\""ground checks on the prostitutes....so you should feel safe in that regard.\n\nDoes housekeeping know that the rooms are being used for trysts....or are you lying in a bed of recent fornication.   \n\nEnough to keep me away in the future for sure."
0;Anyone who gave this place above two stars does not have taste buds. I know Indian food I grew up in Asia. Indian food is one of my favorite cuisines.  I went to the buffet. I received bland, room temperature food  with undercooked meats.  There are good indian food restaurants in Arizona this place is just not one of them. Go to The Dhaba which is just up the street
4;I been in this restaurant many times after. They hire a new chef,  and never had a bad meal,you can tell the difference then before I will keep coming back and   Recommend to all my friends!
0;Terrible customer service. If you want Business don't argue with customers. Whatever they are doing with the rice doesn't taste right. I am a regular customer and come in twice a week and I felt very harassed and I didn't feel welcome. The women's bathroom never has hand soap! How are they washing their hands? This place is last on my list :(
1;My actual Dr appointment was good.  When I picked up my new glasses it seemed they wanted no part of my.  There was no checking to see how they fit or anything.  I could see that the new glasses sat on my face at a slant, she seemed to have NO training in adjustments.  When I walked out of there with one nose pad was almost sideways and digging into my nose as well as my glasses digging into the side head by my ear. So once again I go to the NVC in Scottsdale by work and they fix the problem.\nNot sure how many more chances I should give this office. This is the second time in a row.
3;I just moved the area and came across this one on yelp. I prefer a tanning bed as opposed to spray tan, which many salons are strictly spray only. I was taken back when I entered because the receptionist asked me what my tanning needs were and since I tan very easily, she recommended a great bed which was only a level 2. Normally these girls try to upsell beds just to make commission. I filled out a questionnaire about myself to determine what type of skin I had also. The bed was spacious and clean. I really liked the friendly and warm staff! I will return!
0;Updated review, September, 2011.  This Asian buffet has gone way down hill.  Our last experience there was terrible.  The food was just awful.  The sushi was stale and no sushi maker in sight.  I take back every bit of my previous review, I will not go back.  \n\n(Previous review)  If you like Sushi, you will like this place.  At least 12 different sushi varieties.  The buffet of Asian food was very good.  The buffet does include American food which enlarges the appeal to families, not all 4 year olds are in to Asian.  \nThe food was excellent.  The crab legs actually had flavor.  The dessert bar was nice.  \nWe live near this restaurant and will go often.  I hope it maintains its food quality and does not fall into the buffet trap of yuck food and skeezy presentation.  \nFor Asian buffets, this is the best in the nortwest Valley.
0;STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!\nThe OWNER, as she wanted everyone to know, has the attitude that will keep me from entering any Firehouse Sub location again. Worst attitude and customer service anywhere! The chip on your shoulder hopefully gets knocked off HARD!\n\nYOU MAKE SANDWICHES, YOU'RE NOBODY!
1;Horrible service!!!! It took too long to get our drinks, napkins and utensils. Not to mention we couldn't get our waitress' attention and when she brought our napkins they were dirty. Not the cleanest of restaurants either. The food was ok, nothing special. Loved seeing what they had to offer in their menu but disappointed when it came out. The bacon was the best thing.
1;Where do I begin? I'm lucky I got here because the staff could not give me directions to their own hotel. We mainly came for the big tubs but the first one was all chipped broken so we opt for another room. Our next room had worms and sewage coming out of the bathtub drain. 3 hours later we are finally checked into room that was decent. Since there wasn't a tub that was decent I thought I could relax in the Jacuzzi only to find out it wasn't working. There's a TV in the bedroom but no remote when we asked for one they told us they didn't know where it was there's nothing like getting out of bed to change the channel on the TV. On the second night at 1030 the fire alarm had a false alarm. Thus we had to scramble to get dressed and evacute rhe building. This happened at a most in opportune time in my wife and I's evening. \n\nThe staff did try to accommodate us but it seems like they're trying to play with bad cards. But for their efforts I will give it 2 stars. Such a waste of a promising location.
4;Sehr gute K\u00fcche, gem\u00fctliches Ambiente, kompetenter und unaufdringlicher Service. Ob Gesch\u00e4ftsessen oder in privater Runde - hier macht es immer Freude. Reservierung ist empfohlen. Macht weiter so. Bis zum n\u00e4chsten Mal.
3;"Overall The Trump is a very nice hotel. They don't have a casino so it's great for us nonsmokers who don't want to walk through a cloud of smoke to get to our rooms.\n\nThe rooms are very spacious and nicely decorated. The king size beds are very comfortable. I loved the double sinks in the bathroom and the jacuzzi tub. The bathrooms also have a separate shower and toilet.\n\nRoom service is polite and efficient. And to is guests services; having lost our room key several times, they were very nice about bringing one up or making us a new one.  \n\nMy one complaint about The Trump is that cell phone reception is nonexistent! There were 6 of us on 2 different floors and all different networks and no one had reception. I don't know how this is possible in 2014. That's the only reason we won't be returning to this hotel."
3;Best pho I've ever had, hands down, coming from Sacramento, I come from a very heavily vietnamese populated area where pho is always readily available but the stuff here takes the cake. It was bomb af and the portions are heavy, I'll definitely come back here and try the phozilla challenge, win that jackpot, baby!!!
0;We don't have Dunkin Donuts in Utah, so when I was in Vegas I had to try one! I had had a disappointing visit to Krispy Kreme the day before, So I was hoping that Dunkin would blow me away. It was a horrific excuse for a donut. I got a glazed donut with a chocolate frosting, and it had NO flavor to speak of. All it was was empty calories. This made my disappointing experience at Krispy Kreme look like a 5 star restaurant! \nI guess I know why Utah doesn't have a Dunkin Donuts!
4;We stumbled upon this place during one of the festival of the arts.  The atmosphere is quaint, very friendly, and has a nice down-home feel to it.  The hot dogs are the best, with a wide variety of toppings (try the Nana Tee dog), but if you like bratwurst, I highly recommend it.  We also tried Nana Tee's salsa, of which I was curious, having numerous awards displayed, but I'd have to say those awards were well deserved.  I will be coming back for some more.
4;Friends and I dropped in last Friday and luckily they accommodated us! Three pedi's and a full set of acrylics. Very friendly and those who received pedi's were happy. It's located off the strip in a little strip mall but if you follow your gps no problems getting here. They did get busier as time went on so you may need to make an appointment. Try them out!
1;"\""Dark in the city, night is a wire\nSteam in the subway, earth is a fire...\""\nShe swayed languidly, as her hips gyrated in a seductive and carnal manner most unbecoming of her age,\n\""Do-do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do, do do\""\nwhile human sexuality has no age cap- her guttural languorous dance proclaimed her wanton desire for every ripe male drop of lust she could glean.\n\""Woman you want me, give me a sign\nAnd catch my breathing even closer behind\nDo-do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do, do do...\""\nThe tempo of the live band increased, as the staccato and drunken attempts at dancing of the desperate middle aged men in the room filtered onto the small dance floor.\n\""In touch with the ground\nI'm on the hunt i'm after you..\""\nThe unbridled passions of the room intermingled on the dance floor as we stared in revolted awe, like a train wreck we scoffed at the hook ups that were just kindling, and those now fomenting to completion.

3;It was restaurant week so I thought I'd give Bradley Ogden a shot and I'm disappointed that I haven't tried this place sooner. I actually enjoyed this place more than my dinner at Daniel Boulud Brasserie a few nights before. The atmosphere, while not as elegant as DB Brasserie, felt more warm and inviting. We were seated at a cozy 2-top in the front half of the restaurant. I appreciate the fact that they space out the tables as to give diners a little privacy. Many places will cram in as many tables as possible, leaving diners about a foot apart from their neighbors (and I hate it when larger patrons have to squeeze by and their big ass knocks into my beverage). \n\nWe ordered the prix-fixe restaurant week menu (which is also available on a nightly basis as their pre-theater menu).\n\nFIRST COURSE\n- Blue cheese souffle: smaller than I thought they would be. They look like 2 little muffins. The plating was nice and the flavors were great. The blue cheese souffle matched with the figs was fabulous.\n- Yellow corn soup: as good as the blue cheese souffle was, this was even better. Creamy, yet not too thick or watery with a little bit of a kick from the spiced popcorn.\n\nMAIN COURSE\n- Alaskan halibut: one of the better fish dishes I've had recently -- delicate and flakey, tremendous flavor. I'm usually not a big fan of bok choy, but it went well with the fish.\n- Pork loin: this dish had 2 sizable cuts of pork, both very tender and tasty. The star of this dish was the potato croquettes. There were only about three of them but I could have eaten a whole plate full of them. Fabulous!\n\nDESSERT\n- PB&J bread pudding: tasted much better than I thought it would. Subtle hints of peanut butter, not too overpowering. Warm, moist and delicious.\n- White chocolate panna cotta: light, creamy, not too sweet. Accompanied with fresh berries. It was a really good dessert.\n- Butterscotch pudding: loved it! It was a great way to end the meal.\n\nThe service was really good. Very buttoned-up and formal with the way they clear dishes and silverware between courses. I guess I don't know enough about fine-dining because I asked the server to bring me a new fork for my halibut. They were so quick to swap out silverware that I thought the small fork left on the table was the salad fork. It wasn't. It was a fork specifically for a fish dish. As the server pointed out it had three prongs like Neptune's trident and was designed to pair perfectly with the delicateness (is that a word?) of the fish. I'm an idiot for not knowing that. The server still brought out a regular fork, which I used. By the end of the night our server finally seemed to loosen up and joke around a little bit. Before that point he was a little too formal (all the servers wear suits which just adds to the stiffness of the service). A little personality always adds to the experience in my opinion. \n\nGreat restaurant, great food, service, and atmosphere. 4.5 stars.
4;Got an oil change, it was fairly priced and done quickly.  Employees were polite and helpful.  They noticed one of my brake lights were out, and helped me resolve the issue in the least expensive way possible.  If I'm near glendale again, this is my go to garage if I have any other problems.
4;I was lucky enough to score a sample bag of 8 delicious caramels!\nThe flavors include, vanilla, coffee and raspberry. \nThese are some of the best candies ever, smooth, creamy, just amazing!\nThe shop is located near the Orleans-\nwww.jmauboinechocolates.com\nTry some soon!
0;This place sucks!!!! Jus went there and they wont call the interlock place so you can get an oil change, you need an appt...but if its a repair they will do it...what a joke!!! Dont ever go here again!!! Chandler location has way better customer service
0;Ugh!  We normally come here for breakfast which is good, but made the mistake of having lunch.  WOW, what a disappointment!\n\nWe both ordered salads and ice tea.  It came with wilted lettuce that seemed to have it's strawberry dressing tossed hours earlier.  The portions were minuscule which we didn't finish.   The tab came to $24.76.  Ouch!\n\nSo, skip the lunch and keep to the breakfast menu.\n\nSorry!
3;I come here every now and again with my dad. It's around the corner from where I live, but rather than just the convenience I come for the food. It's not super fancy, but everything always tastes good and fills you up. The staff is always nice and friendly, and they will continue to refill your coffee or water until you tell them to quit. They seem really helpful with food suggestions too, from what I've overheard. Had Joe's Omelet today, less the mushrooms which the waitress agreed with me was a wise move lol.
1;Consistently overbooked. Controlled chaos. Issues with insurance processing. Need to either stop accepting new patients or add dentists.
2;I've only been here for drinks so I cannot say how the food is, but I don't have much to complain about. The service was mediocre, drinks were good, but draws an odd, older crowd.
3;Having not updated my original review of nice GWB2C here since way back 15 months ago, I got Mike C. to join me today to stop back in & see how the place is doing.\n\nThis is a big restaurant, with a variety of seating areas, so you can watch or escape from the two TVs.  Today they had a nice array of 89 food items out, not counting sauces & dressings.  There was a small selection of Sushi, & what I had was good.  Some standout items for me were the delicious roasted peanuts for the salad, excellent fried chicken, homemade style Egg Foo Young with rich brown gravy, bok choy, & the creamy chocolate pudding.  Also, the drink bar includes coffee & milk.  MILK in a Chinese restaurant?\u00bf?\u00bf?     :-))\n\nStill a big 4 Stars for Great Wall Buffet Two Corporation!\n\nLunch Buffet $7.79/$6.79 includes self-serve beverages.
0;"I tried this Detroit style \""pizza\"" last night.  I can only say that I hated it with all my pizza loving heart.  The service was served up begrudgingly since they where more interested in cleaning so they could get out of there early.  We arrived 1 hour before they were to close to find all but the chairs already on the tables.  We ordered the largest special with two drinks and it came to a little over thirty bucks. The employee's were talking with a gross off duty employee loudly just a few feet from us about how one of them hated that he had to work tomorrow and some other lame topics we tried our best to ignore. and he filled his giant cup full of soda.  Finally he left and the other employee went back to cleaning all around us.  It was very uncomfortable and awkward since her cleaning was the only noise in the place.  The TV's were muted and the background music was real low.  Finally the pizza arrived, but I thought they had the order wrong, because I didn't order a $4 frozen Tino's pizza.  This piece of trash they believe to be pizza must be for poor Detroit trailer trash.  I can't believe anyone would eat crap like that.   I totally agree with the other posters who've stated that the toppings taste and look like they came straight out of a bag.  I've had better pizza in high school cafeterias back in the 80's.  This place was a fail on every possible level for me.  I'm going to keep trying what Vegas has to offer till I find a pizza I can eat without crying."
2;Was there for a casual dinner, it was good but not great. The service at times was annoying, especially when they fill your water glass up every 10 seconds. The food was adequate but not spectacular. If you want a spectacular Mastros experience I would suggest going to the Mastro's in Beverly Hills, CA. It is above and beyond anything you'll experience in Las Vegas. I would go back to the Las Vegas location but only after some serious thought and consideration of some of the other steak houses in Vegas.
0;It is important to note that the one star rating has nothing to do with the food or atmosphere as we did not even get a chance to have dinner.  My one-star rating is personal and results from me and my family being super offended by the etiquette -- or lack thereof -- of this little gastroshop.  \n\nNothing says, 'Children Not Welcome Here' like not providing a place for them to sit and have dinner.  No highchairs... really?\n\nFirst, I have heard SUPER great things about this great little hidden treasure.  I SO wanted the Tuck Shop to be my new fav.  My husband, child and are I are true foodies and as part of the Central/North Central community we truly love and support small, eclectic businesses that make up our cool little community.  When we pulled up to the Tuck Shop we were ready to become regulars!  So it was a huge disappointment when we got to our table and asked our server for a highchair for my daughter and his response was, 'We don't have highchairs.'  I was floored!  My husband and I spend a lot of time out and about and have never run into this situation.  After picking my jaw up off of the ground, I asked if children were not welcome at Tuck Shop.  Very flippantly, the server replied, 'No, we just don't have highchairs.'  Needless to say, I gathered my family and hit the road very offended and really not believing what just happened.  We have some pretty great places in our neighborhood... and they ALL accommodate children.  \n\nAnd for the record, I do not enjoy having dinner with screaming children.  I believe that if a child cannot behave properly in public, then they should not be in public.  This includes my child.  She has been carted to every restaurant in the Central/N. Central neighborhood so behaves better than some adults I have had the displeasure of dining with.  If she does happen to act her age in public, my husband or I quickly take her away so as not to disrupt the dining experience of others.  I realize not all parents follow our policy, but really Tuck Shop?  Seems like this 'No Children' policy was designed by a petulant and ill-mannered child.  Tuck Shop, me thinks you need a time-out.
1;"It's right by where I work so is convenient. The decor and efforts to make it look Irish are top notch. Here's why it gets 2 stars:\n\n1. Teach your staff how to pour a Guinness or go and actually spend some time in Ireland to realize the importance of this or at least Google/YouTube a correct pour. One pour with a head full of bubbles and a head ranging from 2mm - 2 inches is not acceptable. If the owner (who's not Irish) is going to run a business and profit from our traditions and culture at least take the time to learn something about the country.\n\n2. Irish Breakfast should be just that - not some attempt with not even close to an Irish sausage, no rashers, beans etc . The other attempts at traditional Irish food are ok - Shepherd's Pie, Stew etc.\n\n3. Service can be very hit or miss. Never fantastic but often times it is absolutely terrible.\n\n4. Finally. A lot won't understand why this is a big deal - I suggest search the net. There's a Happy \""Patty's\"" Day ornament in the cabinet on the right when you walk in. \n\nSuggestion - hire a manager/senior bar person who is Irish or has spent a decent amount of time bar tending in Ireland and listen to their advice. Most of the problems are easily fixed.\n\n\n*EDIT - I nearly forgot about this!! To add insult to injury after point 4 above, this is on their menu:\n\nAn Broc Angus Beef Burger**\nCertified Black Angus Beef Paddy, Choice of Char or Flat Top Grilled. Served on Your Choice of Our Guinness Roll or Sesame Wheat Bun\n\nGRRRR!!"
4;I was told to go to this salon by my best friend after I had fried my hair in a depressed state. (Long story)  I slumped in and was immediately set at ease and take care of totally by Erica with a FANTASTIC cut and Gina with some color shampoo.   The damage finally grew out but I still go because Erica or Susan give me such great cuts and Gina gets me in when I need to - fast too!  Lily does great waxing and the place is just urban cool.  It smells good too.
2;If you are ever looking for a place to reunite with long lost family members, I highly recommend Postino. \n\nI went there on a suggestion by my Bestie, Dottsy Z. after I received a phone call from my uncle (whom I had never met in my life) wanting to meet for brunch on Sunday. I was looking for a central location between Mesa and Avondale and Dottsy being the Social Diva Extraordinaire knew the spot! \n\nIt was the perfect day for sitting on the patio. The trees provided enough shade to prevent me from improving upon my already awesome farmers tan I received the day before at the Good Guys Auto Show. There was a trio playing a good mix of soft music although I would have toned down the volume a bit. All in all it was the perfect setting for my first meeting with my uncle, his wife and my cousin. \n\nThe menu is perfect for light Italian dining. The majority of us ordered panini's. I had the prosciutto and brie on ciabatta with salad. It was AH-MAZING. Being the Italian gal I am I love me some prosciutto, and added with the brie and fig...YUM! My cousin had the same and he devoured his before I had even three bites in to mine. It may be the fact that he is on spring break from the Naval Academy that he has the constant appetite of a teenage boy. My aunt had the bruschetta which she loved but couldn't finish, my cousin took care of that problem. My husband had the tuna panini and like my cousin took his down in seconds flat.\n\nThe only down side to the menu was the lack of kid friendly options. We had our 18 month old son with us and there wasn't a thing on the menu he would touch. Luckily our server was kind enough to bring a bowl out of their organic chips for him to munch on, and happily he did. So unless your little one can maintain on chips alone or has an advanced palate, I would refrain from taking them along. \n\nThere are so many other things on the menu that I want to try. I cannot wait for my next visit!
3;Star Mexican grill is what a small owner operator mexican restaurant  should be, it is not a white linen $20.00 entree type Mexican but the food is very good, stick with the basics Tacos, enchiladas, and Burritos, they serve rice and beans with most dishes really like the chicken or pork enchiladas. the prices are $5.00 to $7.00 a few dishes higher it is served on disposable plates and plastic silver, they have some sauces on a small bar area if you like hot there hot sauce is very good and home made. This is just what I expect out of a small Mexican diner. good cheap food, you will like it
2;Really nice food however it is very overpriced. $10 for guacamole is outrageous, even if it is prepared tableside.  The pollo mole is spicey with just the right amount of chocolate.  Service was nothing great, noticed the table next to us who had a different waitress got a lot more attention than our waiter gave us.  Would I go back again yes, but would like it much better if someone else was paying.
3;Our last night in the Phoenix area and this was our last stop! I had already eaten a trillion times that day and the whole week--needless to say I wasn't as hungry as I normally am. On  tjhis certain Friday night after 7pm, the restaurant was very busy and there was a wait. What I did like about this restaurant is they take your phone number and they will notify you via text when you table is ready. We had a 40 minute wait so this gave us plenty of time to shop! The hostess was very nice! After about 35 minutes of waiting/shopping at the mall, a text was sent to let me know my table would be ready soon and to start heading back. My husband grabbed the table before I made it back but the hostess kindly directed me to our table. Once seated it took our waiter a moment to get there---hey were busy so I understand. He finally came and took our drink orders while we looked over the menu. I tried their pink lemonade (not sure what the lemonade was mixed with) which was delicious! One thing that I did not like was our waiter waited until we waited for a while, placed our drink order, had a our drinks refilled, and placed our food order before he brought bread to our table. For the most part he was very nice. Our food arrived and I ordered a Brio Chopped salad and added a side of grilled chicken to go with it (only three dollars or so to add chicken to a salad). My salad, the chicken, and the restaurant dressing was very good! My daughter got the kids pizza which was the size of an adult pizza that could feed two people--at least! Her pizza also had fresh ingredients and tasted good. My husband ordered a Strawberry Balsamic Chicken Salad--which was soooooo good! My mother in law ordered a Caesar salad and barely received any salad in her bowl. The waiter was nice enough to take the salad back and have them add more salad to her bowl. The original salad she received ordered was very skimpy on the portion--I am not even sure if it was a joke or not. Although we didn't order any of their major menu items, the items we did ordered were really good. I am not a major Italian restaurant eater, but when I return to the Phoenix area and have a larger appetite for Italian, I will be sure to give them another try.
3;Petsmart continues to be my one stop shop for everything Harley. From food, to toys, to grooming, to the vet to a place to lay his head for the nights when I'm out of town, Petsmart never lets me down. This past weekend I left town and Harley spent the weekend at the hotel and then got a much-needed grooming on Sunday. I picked him up smelling fresh, looking handsome and acting very happy from his weekend at the hotel!
4;I took my kids and it was fantastic.  They had samples of the chocolate chocolate chip cake and it was to die for!!  Both my girls ordered a mini one of those.  My son got cinnamon and I got Red Velvet.  I think the chocolate chocolate chip was the best.\n\n$4 for a mini and it is plenty for two.
1;The fianc\u00e9 and I love Cuban food. We had a couple die hard favorites back in SoCal that we would frequent on a monthly basis. We've been missing our Cuban craving fix since moving here to Phoenix. So last Friday evening as we were deciding where to get our grub on we happened to pass by Havana Cafe. The fianc\u00e9 had heard good things about this place from coworkers so we decided to bust a U turn and give it a try. \n\nIt is located in a small strip mall with a metal gate door. A little sketch looking but we weren't deterred because good food often comes from little dives. The place was pretty busy but we were seated right away. It was a little weird for us to be seated side by side on a bench which the hostess first had to slide the table forward, allowing us access to the bench, and then proceeded to slide the table back in towards us so we were essentially boxed in. But moving on....The place is loud with great live music but you find yourself having to talk really loud to your server to get your order in. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 ordered his usual favorite: ropa vieja. I couldn't really find anything that looked especially appealing to me...for a reasonable price at least. So I settled on a tamal cubano and the ceviche from the appetizer menu. Overall, the food was good. We enjoyed the ropa vieja and the ceviche. I only wished that the ceviche came with chips instead of crackers. The tamale was good and had bits of pork in it which made it more of a crowd pleaser for the fianc\u00e9. However, both of us felt that we didn't enjoy our meals as much as we do at our fave Cuban place back home. Plus, we didn't feel our meals were worth the prices here so we left a little unsatisfied. Don't get me wrong...we are not opposed to spending good money on food that we feel is worth it so please note that our review is not because we're cheapskates or anything. But if you plan on hitting this place up then be prepared to pay $20 and up per entree. \n\nBottom line is that we may or may not go back. Nothing really wrong with this place but nothing overly exciting either. Maybe a future visit will change my opinion but until then we will be continuing our search for our go to Cuban spot.
0;this man the owner called and threaten R and B whole sale had his friend call and death threaten him for giving him a bad review this man IS EVIL!!!!!!! he didnt do the job right had to take him to court and he tells us to f off and said i will never give you your money an keeps sending death threats DO NOT EVER TRUST THIS HORRIBLE person. he has no manners at all always cussing NEVER professional  swear to god he death threaten!!!!!!!!!!!
3;"I think I was imagining cigarette stained walls, low-slung ceilings and trashy looking people, but I was WAY off.  Casino Arizona is a really gorgeous casino.  I haven't been to many casinos here, but if you closed your eyes, fell asleep and woke up on the casino floor [not that I've done that or anything] you might think you're in Las Vegas.  Everything you can find in casino there, you can find here - slots, betting,  roulette, you name it.\n\nI was here for a company Christmas party a couple of weeks ago and schmoozed, boozed and nibbled on appetizers.  The food was delicious.  I wasn't surprised though, because I've heard their fancy restaurant, Cholla, is critically acclaimed. I recall all the food served cocktail-style as being delicious - the highlights being the coconut fried shrimp, foccacia pizza, charcuterie plate and roasted veggies.  And all the cocktail waitresses walk around Vegas-style mumbling \""Cocktails? Cocktails?\""\n\nYou can get your Beatles cover band fix every few months or so when Beatlemania performs.  Yes, it does sell out every time too. Besides that and Showstoppers, you can find the comedian circuit or occasional big-name performer stop here.  Don Rickles was performing last week. \n\nIt's not Las Vegas, and shouldn't be considered as such.  But for the serious gambler or the tourist who might be itching to throw down a few, Casino Arizona might just do the job."
2;It was ok for a buffet. We had to wait for a table in which we thought if we were waiting then it was going to be awesome. The food was mediocre & selection was alright.  Standard beef broccoli, sweet & sour chicken , & rangoon. But nothing out of the ordinary.
1;The food is OK. Not great. The customer service is OK. I've been here twice in 20 hours because it's close to my house. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here though.
3;Excellent place to eat in Arrowhead. I've been here at least 30 times but this is my first review??!!!??!?  Ha\n\nAnyways anything on the menu is good! I've had most of the featured entree and its all good recently the black peppered chicken is awesome!!  The wife is in love with the Carmel steak or chicken.  Big entrees so good enough to share but we had a buy 1 get 1 free so we ate like royalty!   \n\nAlways clean and good service. If you are looking for a good place in the Arrowhead area to eat look at Pei Wei!
3;"You don't need a view when your room is this big. The secrecy of Hotwire deals in \""downtown Pittsburgh\"" is a situation. Their perimeter crosses into the Southside and whatever you call north of The Point across the bridge. And when you cross reference the hotels in that area on Yelp with the providers on Hotwire, you can end up in very different situations. Then, you can research the Omni price -- $190 regularly -- against the Hotwire deal $120 and it's worth the risk. \n\nLarge room. Large king bed. Large room service 24 hour menu. Large hallways. Wander them. If you're looking to pull an Aaron Sorkin in a random American city and stay in a hotel without leaving for 24 to 144 hours straight, this is your place in Pittsburgh. The expansive lobby gives you enough fresh air. The front desk staff is simple & accommodating. If you're the type to leave the hotel then it's a decent location. Just know there isn't a decent bar within 5 blocks, and you're only decent walkable option is to jaunt over to Market Square. But if it's summer time and you want to walk to PNC park for a game or the Heinz museum, it's a perfect option. \n\nAlso, robes."
0;Gave a second chance, food is good but service sucks. I will just say had two not so good experience with 2 different waiters. 1st one was asked to hold the onions and we we told him there was onions he said let me check, this was implying we were wrong, then came back and said it was his fault, never apologized and when we left he ran to the table to see if we left a tip, he thought we were not watching. He was rude and not very pleasant.  The 2nd time I went to give them a try, we were going to leave because he was there, but another waitress stop us by saying she would be our waitress, she was nice but I made my order an never got my slice of pizza, when she realized I was already paying  the check and by then I did not want the pizza anymore.  I think she should if offered the pizza for free since she forgot and the 1st waiter never apologized and never offered something for his mistake, so we will not be going there, I'm\nAfraid what the next thing is going to happen.
0;Do not eat here....even for the 50% off happy hour special. It's not worth it. I just experienced the worst service and I swear every roll tasted like a California roll. \n\nI understand the waitresses had to accommodate to some large parties that night but this restaurant is a large venue and should be well versed in multi-tasking and careering to various parties. I also noted the waitress would constantly check on the table of 2 next to us. She stopped by them 4 times and never came to check on us. \n\nHere is our wait time broken down: We waited 3 minutes to be seated, 15 minutes to place our order and 25 minutes for the first wave of food to arrive. \n\nWe ordered 8 rolls total and our last 2 rolls didn't come till more than an hour after we ordered them. Were they one sushi chef down today or is this how it always is? Also I wished the waitress would have told us what rolls she delivered as opposed to running off and leaving us playing the guessing game.\n\nI hate to be harsh on a restaurant that has potential but this just isn't cutting it for me...maybe I'm just accustomed to better service in California.
4;Gonna keep it short.\n\nEver since I was 19, (I know, I was doing the dirtbag thing and drinking underage) I have set aside time in every Vegas trip just to come here for a 190 Octane. \n\nSuper Awesome and Super worth your hard earned dollar....period.
1;"Can I start this review with a little emoesque touch.... I am sad... To say the least. I hear from every direction that jimmy johns is #1, the best, the winner, the best looking, best smelling, moi guapo, the sexiest sandwich this side of the Rio grand and for that I say to you all, I am glad that none of you happened to be my wing man in my younger days. This place was T-T-T-Terrible. Pulling up to this joint I was curious if the recommendations would pay off and at first glance I thought yes it would. I mean pulling up to place that has a bright neon sign that clearly says Free Smells seems comical and like they had something up their sleeves. Open the door and POW you are hit with the smell of Pickles and floor cleaner but I can look past that so I take a quick look at the menu and decide to grab a gargantuan, the wife figured you can go wrong with a BLT and the kids would kick down a turkey and cheese. \n\nI know that the order sounds pretty ordinary and seems pretty easy to achieve greatness, unfortunately that was not the case. After waiting in the cramped quarters for our sandwiches we sat down to see what the jimmy johns hype is all about and that first bite was like the moment your parents popped your favorite balloon and all the air shot out of it and you felt completely let down. Okay so that might be a little much and if it felt like that then you may want to be checked for daddy issues but I assure you it was not good. \n\nI was hungry so I dealt with my sandwich but my wife asked me to try her BLT and see if I thought the bacon was no good or something and even though I thought for a second that she was over reacting and in my mind I mumbled, \"" come on Hun, bacon is bacon\"" as I took a bite I began to scream in my mind, \"" What the hell is that, it is definitely not bacon\"". so first thing was first she stripped the bacon out of her sandwich and decided to pull a piece of turkey out of the kids sandwich and transform her BLT to a turkey sandwich in hopes for a better experience but the issue was that the turkey sandwich had only one slice of meat and we couldn't just give the kids a bread sandwich now could we. \n\nI don't want to turn this into a 100% rant but unfortunately to all of you Jimmy Johns Lovers that I know, please warn me before we hand out next time.... I'll grab Subway. I'm sorry was that a low blow, Well sometimes the truth is like a kick in the metaphorical nutts."
0;Don't do it! The food took forever and when my husband's steak finally came (which he had ordered medium rare) it was well-done. They sent it back and the replacement was tar-tar, absolutely raw inside. The atmosphere was lackluster and the entire experience was bad.
4;"I walked in last Wednesday with some co-workers, expecting to get my usual slice and a cannolo (Gio recently taught me the singular form of cannoli... lunch and a lesson, haha!).  Much to my surprise, they had a special treat that day that they don't make often:  porchetta, or Italian pork roast, with an au jus type sauce.  Offered in the form of a sandwich on their signature sourdough, my mind was changed instantly.  Why not try something I'd never had before, especially when it smelled so heavenly?\n\nAnd what a good decision it was!  Juicy with a crispy outer layer and full of flavor from the herb mixture it was stuffed with, it had a bit of the \""au jus\"" poured over it that soaked into the bread.  All the flavors mixed together into one of the most delicious dishes I've had in a very long time.  I rarely eat my entire meal, but this was one I couldn't stand to let go to waste.\n\nThe moral of the story:  If you ever happen to stop in on a porchetta day, forget about pizza and eat the pork.  :)"
4;watch replacment was great
3;"Time to get crafty...crafty and buzzed.\n\nLas Vegas has really come a long way since the days of only catering to the tourist. I mean there's over two million people now living permanently in the Valley...so move over loud \""woo-hooing\"" bachelorette parties and all L.A. peeps who claim they run the strip (even though they only visit twice a year) the locals have officially reclaimed their city and I couldn't be happier. \n\nThe craft beer mushroom cloud is slowly rising over Las Vegas and Bad Beat Brewing will definitely be apart of that boom. The main tasting room is a little plain on the inside, but very clean. There are multiple tables to sit and sip at; along with a dart board, giant bean bag chair accompanied by a TV, and a classic Nintendo game system. They have anywhere from 7 to 13 different beers on tap depending on the season, but just like any hop-headed thirsty young buck I ordered a flight to help me decide on that final pint. \n\nThe flights come in groups of 5 unless you want to just try all their beers on tap which would make it 7. I chose to do this and was very \""hoppy\"" with my decision; all the beers were great with exception of their sour ale. This one didn't really sit well me, but I don't like sours anyway so don't let that sway your decision to at least have a sip. \n\nI tried a good chunk of their beers during my visit, but I'm just going to focus on my favorites, the \""Ante Up\"" was delicious with a super smooth flavor, very light golden brown color, and didn't leave me feeling full. This is a beer that I could easily drink over the course of a few hours while watching football. My other favorite was the \""Gutshot\"", this beer has a very menacing black color resembling that of a Guinness, which would make sense because this is a dry Irish Stout.  This beer looked very hoppy with a think foamy head on it, but it was actually insanely smooth with no bitter after taste. It was a little on the heavy-side and belongs in the \""session beer\"" category in my opinion. This is one glass of beer that will go a long way...get me a nipple please because I'm sippin'!\n\nBad Beat Brewing is great and I have very high hopes for this brewery in the future. I talked with some of the owners while I was there and they have some awesome stuff planned for the next couple of months. \n\nStay thirsty my friends."
0;I'm not sure why everyone loves this place.  Maybe it's the gigantic portions of meat they serve.  I was not impressed by the veggie section of the menu...oh wait, there's not one...and no, I don't like oatmeal or f-ing grapefruit for breakfast.  ick.  I've waited in line once--that'll be enough for me, Matt.
1;"I'm so very sad about the review I have to write about this place.  I was so excited to go to Petite Maison.  I had gone to the Yelp event at the Science Center and was absolutely floored by how delicious the beef tongue with bone marrow au ju was at PM.  I immediately made a reservation for the following week to go to the real deal.  \n\nWe had a reservation for six people at 7pm.  We all arrived and were seated outside, which was fine since it was a beautiful night.  However, it took forever for our waiter to come acknowledge us.  Finally after about 10 minutes, he comes over and takes our drink orders and recommend some specials.  We ordered the mussels and scallops as appetizers and ordered our entrees.  Four of us wanted the duck breast, but they only had three left, so one of our friends ordered the pork tenderloin.  About ten minutes later he brings us some bread (almost like eggy popovers, very good), but he only brought out five, so we asked for one more since not all of us got to try it.  After about another 10 minutes, he does--by this time we all need a refill on our drinks but get no attention.\n\nWe get our appetizers finally, and they are pretty good.  The mussels are cooked perfectly with a nice light broth and the scallops are in a creamy white sauce.  Fast forward another 30 minutes and we finally get our main entrees.   The steak frites was eh.  Left much to be desired.  The steak was slightly tough and mostly flavorless and the frites were limp.  The duck breast (times three) was good, cooked just right, but the risotto was surrounded by a lake of broth which made it too soupy for some of us.  The pork tenderloin was on the dry side and not that great.  The last was the salmon which was \""interesting\"".  It was an odd combination of flavors which didn't make it bad, but wasn't out of this world.  Half way through out entrees we flagged our waiter down (since he never came over to see how we liked our food), and ordered dessert--the souffle requires 15 minutes--turns out it was more like 30 minutes.\n\nFinally around 10pm we got our dessert, two souffles and french two cream puffs.  They were good-but after having to wait basically an hour between the appetizer, entree and dessert, I was just looking forward to getting out of there.  We basically had to wave our hands in the air constantly to get anyone to come over to get anything.  What made it worse was that since we were a party of 6, we had 21% gratuity automatically added.  I can't help but wonder if that's why they chose to ignore us all night.\n\nI hope others have better experiences here."
2;Moira isn't the best sushi I've ever had, but for Phoenix and my neighborhood and the pricepoint (as long as we don't order alcoholic beverages) is doable when we get a sushi craving. \n\nThe happy hour is a great benefit if you can get away from work before it ends.  \n\nTheir spicy rolls are definitely spicy, and have some great kick to them.\nIt hits the spot without breaking the bank and we'll take it.
0;"This place has HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Especially the hostess/cashier in the front, the lady has serious attitude problem: if your staff cannot deal with human being in the front, please schedule that person to work BOH, so she/he can provide the best use of his/her labor. We had problem with this lady on 2 different occasions already. Once was on Christmas eve /day, I called ahead of time to see if they were open, and was told they are open till 9PM. So I went there around 5ish, and was told by the lady that they STOP seating already, I understand that you were busy, but the tone and attitude she had was really bad, and rude.\nSecond time was last night, we got there early, again 5ish, SAME person: \""sorry we stop seating for today unless you have a reservation\"", I replied \""I thought you guys dont' take reservations?!\"", she answered \""yes, we don't, but it's our 3rd anniversary, so we open for reservations.\"", I asked her how would the customer know if they can or cannot book reservation, she replied with a VERY rude and unprofessional tone, \""well, if you have been to our restaurant for the last few weeks, we have been talking about it.\"".\nREALLY?? so you are telling me that if I don't go every week, Im NOT welcome here?!? I work in service industry, I know how important it is to be nice to your customer, even the assholes, I always answer with a smile on the face when Im in front of customers, I also co-own a restaurant, and I know damn right it's NOT the right way to treat the customers. She better be the owner there, otherwise the owner should really consider to get rid of her, she obviously can not be working as the front of the house. There are plenty of sushi houses in town, food there is not bad, but for the last few times I went there, the service had been lacking and some of the service staffs have the attitude of \""oh-our-place-is-so-good-and-you-are-SOOOO-lucky-to-eat-here, now-what-the-heck-do-you-want-me-to-bring-you?\""\nI will not be the one that's paying money to take shit from service staffs. NEVER GO THERE AGAIN and I will make sure to tell anyone I know."
4;Quality pizza all the way. The cheese crust and sauce were of such high quality this easily is the best pizza I have had in Las Vegas. I have ordered from them several times and they are consistently amazing. Great job guys!
3;"I had a bunch of random garbage and junk around my house. I wasn't familiar with junk removal companies, so I called them up to see how much it would cost to remove all of it--they couldn't give me an estimate over the phone because their prices are based on how much truck space is required to fit all your stuff.\n\nI asked them to come out to give me an estimate. They were able to make it that afternoon. They quoted me $252 to remove all the stuff--it was a little expensive, but the speed they removed the junk was totally worth it! Ah, no more junk. ;)\n\nI would definitely recommend them to anyone looking to get rid of their random junk in a hurry. I would not recommend them to anyone who is on a tight budget."
3;Vanessa R., Corrie C. and myself started our Saturday night here and apparently it was John Legend's birthday at Aria so everywhere else was packed except View Bar. \n\nWe grabbed some comfy lounge chairs and Vanessa R. ordered me the legendary margarita they serve here. The tequila was so smooth it gave me that warm honey sensation running down the back of my throat. The mixer was brilliant and perfectly sized...not too skimpy but not a boat load of marg. \n\nWe only hung around for one cocktail but I'll be sure to stop by on my next trip out there.
4;This is my favorite Starbucks, and I have been a gold card member since I was 13.  Also, be sure to look for Veronica, the barista who knows everyone who walks through the door.  These baristas make it a true caf\u00e9, and whether you're reading a book, running through, or just people watching, it's the perfect place with great service and great drinks.
2;Magnolia's Veranda is not a bad dinner for the price. Skip the seafood selections on the menu.  Stick to the steaks, prime rib, hamburgers and fries.  You can't good wrong with those items.
1;It is very small, cramped and smells like a mixture of old people and cigarettes. The selection of items was okay, I guess. Nothing to rave about. Some of their items were moderately priced, others not so much. \n\nI thought they might have some hidden gems to find in here but alas, they did not. It is truly just an average run of the mill not so cheap thrift shop.\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to return.
0;Ich war dort nur ein mal da ich beim Einkauf das Gef\u00fchl hatte nicht Willkommen zusein. Der Service war einfach nur Super unfreundlich
1;$14.35 for a beer and a coke. \n\nI'm OK with the price, this is the Airport. What I'm not OK with is my girl couldn't get the soda she wanted  and I couldn't get the beer I wanted. I got the feeling the bartender didn't really care either way. \n\nIt's also guaranteed when you leave you and all your baggage will be completely saturated with smoke. What would be a trip to Vegas with out bathing in smoke?
2;Amazing view, good services, good food.
3;I'd almost give them 5 stars other than the barber made me bleed with the straight razor haha. Nothing crazy, but they did a really good bald fade. I was worried since I just moved here from Michigan.
4;Get the bean & cheese chimi. It will never disappoint. Now, I need to go have some Elmer's...
0;(Gamblers warning) Man oh man!!! This may be long winded but needs to be said.\n   \nOn Aug 26th I met my boyfriend at 5pm while he ate and played four card keno. I put in a $20 bill and asked to change 10 ones for a $10 bill. I received 2 $5's which is obviously fine but somehow the machine registered $30 dollars as  $23.75 and not $30!! I was confused because I didn't even touch a button?!! The bartender/GM called the slot tech and told me it would be 10mins. PSH! An hour and 45m it took!  I had 3 drinks within almost the two hours I waited. Finally they figured it out that between the $20 I put in and the 2 $5s I put in they said there was 6 hands played??!!!! What the hell!?! They eventually gave me my money because it was obviously something wrong with the machine. After that was resolved I started to play and I ordered a cocktail. Once I gambled my $30 I put in another $20 and ordered another cocktail. When the bartender brought me my drink she told me they started a tab for both my drinks cuz I only played $30. Huh? I told her I just put in another $20 and it made me feel like I needed to gamble more money. Meanwhile my boyfriend was playing 4 card keno since he got there. The whole time he was winning and losing but apparently not enough for any of his drinks to be comped. \n\nThe bartenders are always checking their phones which you can clearly see they're texting or checking Facebook  and for whatever reason couldn't ever remember my boyfriend's Sam Adams, but they did make sure they remembered to charge us for all our drinks? After putting  $80 into the machine and being charged for my drinks I had enough of putting my money into their machines! \n\nSo here's our bill. We were basically told we didn't gamble enough?! Although my boyfriend was winning and losing and played $90 himself!! We were very surprised when we got the bill and tried to explain the money we played to Chris the GM/Bartender. He took my 3olives off the bill but why did I have to even justify that to them.! \n\n     I've seen plenty of players drink tons and play as much as us and NOT get a bill for almost as much as they put in!!! Crap!
2;They are called Island Style but once you see their menu, you will discover that they serve Hawaiin, Korean, and American dishes.\n\nFirst off, if you are not actively looking for their sign, you are definitely gonna miss it. Even when I parked, I still had to look around for what door I had to go in. The door to their restaurant isnt labeled. So after sticking my head in there, I confirmed it. \n\nSo I sit down and the nice lady hands me a menu. Just like that they put a small to go box of boiled peanuts on your table. I guess you can take it home if you dont finish? Nice. They also give you a glass of water by default. Also nice. But thats where I notice my good experience ends.\n\nI ordered Beef Teriyaki. They bring it out accompanied with a sampler plate of kim chi which consisted of cabbage, bean sprouts, some kind of radish, and sliced hot dogs? As for the Teriyaki Beef, they actually give you a decent amount of beef and rice. (refer to my pic). \n\nI probably would of enjoyed my meal better if I got a refill or two on my water. As soon as I got my food, the next time I saw the server, she was bringing out my check. I asked nicely for a refill on my water. I decided to pay with cash for I had a feeling it was gonna take a while for her to come back with my refill thinking that charging my card will also take some time. I wasnt in any rush or anything but there were people waiting to sit down and eat. \n\nSo overall, I wasnt really blown away. My bill was about 10 dollars. I tipped 2 bucks which was what I thought was more than generous considering my mediocre experience. I dont think I will be going out of my way just to eat here.
4;"I met Rich and Dave through a networking event in Las Vegas.  I was lucky enough to meet them at there office and really speak to them about there business.  What impressed me the most is the passion, experience and professionalism they posses.  When making an appointment to see what they provide such as engagement rings, custom jewelery or colored gems, these two are knowledgeable.  It's a private environment, no \""mall atmosphere\"" and they truly listen to what you are looking for.  I have a ring that I wanted them to redesign for me and they took the time to walk me through the process and provide a very reasonable price.  I also had the chance to look at beautiful loose diamonds, which was fun.  I would highly recommend anyone who is interested in engagement rings, bridal sets, loose diamonds, diamond earrings or redesign an existing piece.  Thank you for being so great to me!"
4;"This place is perfect if you live in Henderson and don't feel like going all the way to Red Rock or Mt. Charleston for a good hike. The trailhead begins at Hidden Falls Park and if you can, make sure to drive all the way down to the end of it, where there is a decent amount of parking for Amargosa Trail. \n\nImmediately, you are greeted with a trail sign, showing not only Amargosa Trail, but other trails in Henderson that you may enjoy. And so, you start your adventure, feeling triumphant and adventurous, until you come to a fork in the road. Do you go left or right? This time, we opted for left, towards the condos that I wish I could afford. The trail itself is fairly easy and there are A LOT of branch offs for people who feel extra adventurous. My husband I were those people. We got to the end of it, seen a branch to a higher area and went for it. Our total adventure was about 1.3 miles and burned around 515 calories. Not bad for an hour! \n\nThe view is amazing and you can see all of Boulder City and the surrounding mountains. If you go up far enough, like we did, you hear this wonder think called silence. It's always fun to find places like this. Looking off into the distance to see the busy streets, yet not being able to hear anything but the wind at your back. I will be going back a lot. Just be sure to wear appropriate shoes if you opt on some of the harder trails. :) \n\nThere are a lot of different side trails to take, so this place is only not acceptable if you are a \""one trick pony\"" type of person, but who is?"
2;This place is A-OK!  I was contemplating giving it 4 stars but the scene is getting a bit dated.  They need to spruce it up or something.  It's just sorta there now.  But don't get me wrong, every time I go here I enjoy myself - but I make sure I have a good group to go with.  You do see some regulars but that's just the type of place that it is.  I like that you get a mixed crowd, no one too young and most of the people that seem to frequent this joint are in there late 20's, 30's, and 40's.\n\nIt can get a bit pricey if you have a tab open and aren't thinking about what your drinking and how much the drinks are.  The drinks are made reasonably well, by that I mean they have enough alcohol in them so that you don't have to wonder why you just paid $10 for ice, water, and a splash of alcohol.  \n\nBack in the day Bossa Nova was a novel idea for this town, but now with all these upscale bars/lounges and restaurants opening they may have to reinvent themselves somehow.  \n\nAll in all a fun place to hang out.  One thing I noticed is that there is a gap between when it's jumping.  Right after work is good b/c you get the happy hour peeps, but then it seems to clear out after 7:30 PM and then it picks back up around 10:30 PM...maybe it was just the night that I went, but I have a feeling that this is the norm.
1;"When giving two stars, the Yelp Star selector says \""Meh. I've experienced better\"" and strangely enough the word \""Meh\"" is flagged on Yelp's own spell checker. This is puzzling to me. How is it that Yelp can use the word \""Meh\"" yet their own spell checker rejects the use of this oh so appropriate verbiage, especially when describing Viet Kitchen. I work really close to this little place, which is always very clean and is staffed by some very nice folk. The menu selection is ample yet typical of any Vietnamese fair... Pho, Vermicelli dishes, French type sandwiches, spring rolls, etc.\n\nBut everything I've had is just.... here it comes..... you know what I'm gonna say.... you guessed it..... MEH. Nothing is great, everything is just ok. Where's the love? This is how I feel about the place. If you're completely Jonesing (another term not in spell checker) for Vietnamese food, this place will satisfy your craving, but after your meal you might end up saying \""Meh, I've experienced better\""."
1;"Pizza is average - they use the \""sweet\"" sauce which I do not care for. Pomo is better. Service was very slow and not very nice."
3;We ate here twice while we stayed at Encore.  The prices were average (for Encore prices) and it was delicious.  I ordered finger food both times but my boyfriend ordered a burger the first time and pancakes the second time.  He raved about both.  Their mac n cheese bites are to DIE for!  Their chicken lollipops are awesome as well!
0;Four of us went here for lunch on 02/27/14 and we all agreed it was the WORST hamburger we ever had.  The meat was tasteless and very dry and the hotdog was so awful my husband hardly ate any of it.  We all had to try the hotdog to believe it was that bad, and one bite was enough to confirm.  I don't understand how the owner can serve that kind of beef when it is his entire menu.  Perhaps if he ever tried a good burger, like perhaps Chili's burgers, he would change his meat supplier.  It was also very boring that there were no other choices of food for lunch, and not even one good dessert.  I think the waitress offered a milkshake for dessert.  Really?? The one thing we did enjoy was the French fries, but that wasn't enough to ever go back.  I spent about $70.00 (including tip) on a lunch nobody liked.  This was our only bad meal in 5 days in Vegas.
2;My mom and I finally made it to the Ansel Adam's exhibit at the Phoenix Art Museum -- on its final day, no less -- and after perusing his beautiful photography, we were ready to get a bite to eat. I'd heard about the Arcadia Farms Cafe in the museum, and thought this was the perfect opportunity to give it a try.\n\nIt was a quaint cafe -- not too big, not too small, and if it was a lovely fall or spring day, I could see myself really enjoying the outdoor patio.  Nevertheless, the floor to ceiling windows offered a lovely view of the unusual and quirky sculptures spotting the museum grounds. \n\nMy mom and I were seated promptly, but it seemed to take a bit longer than usual before our waitress finally arrived to take our drink order.  After that it was a bit more of a wait before we received our simple water order and placed our meal order.  And then, again, we waited what seemed a bit too long for our simple sandwiches to arrive. It wasn't that big of a deal, since it gave me time to chat with my mom about the photography we just viewed.\n\nI had the tomato, basil and mozzarella sandwich and my mom (if I remember correctly) had their signature strawberry and chicken salad. I do remember distinctly my mom telling me she LOVED the vinaigrette, and my sandwich was quite delicious, although I have to say I could have done with a little less mozzarella -- it kind of overpowered the sandwich and left me feeling over-cheesed.\n\nDespite it being a bit pricey for a lunch spot ($14 for a salad?!) and the slightly long wait, I had a nice experience at Arcadia Farms, and I would love to try some of their other dishes on my next visit. Plus, I would love to take advantage of their Sunday brunch and a mimosa or two with some girlfriend.
4;This place made my Vegas experience.  A momentary brief calm in the sea of slot machines.  It was dirty, it was grimy, there was Japanese anime porn on the television.  It was everything the glitz and glam everywhere else in Vegas was trying to cover up.  It was the proverbial whore beneath the make-up and I loved every second of it.  $4 shots of ass juice, tack on an extra dollar and get a beer and beef jerky.  A must see, just be sure to use the back door.
2;I agree with Paul on this one. But I had to stop here on my way home from work tonight. \n(I think I feel my heart yelling at me again) , The gal at the drive thru window was just soooo sweet , I just might go back and ask her to marry me! \nBut then again , she gave me a slip with a survey on it to fill out online. \nMaybe she just wanted my positive response. Ok Sarah B. you got it ... now where's my free coke ?
2;Been coming here for years, figured that it was time for a review of the buffet.\n\nLet's cut to the chase: The food is average. Nothing too exceedingly fancy, but better than mystery meat swimming in gravy. Breakfast offerings usually include waffles, french toast, made-to-order omelettes, and various styles of breakfast meats and potatoes. Lunch and dinner are pretty much the same, with basic fried seafood, pizza, chinese food (which is pretty tasty), with some nights offering crab legs and steaks for a slightly higher price.\n\nThe wait staff is generally nice and attentive.\n\nThe price really can't be beat. As long as you have a player's card, breakfast lunch and dinner are 6-9-12 dollars, respectively. Compared to other buffet offerings, I'm not sure where else you can get a decent breakfast or lunch for under $10.\n\nIn review: It's inexpensive, it's basic.
0;I am usually very positive about reviews  and complementary about employees. Unfortunately, I made the decision of visiting this establishment tonight. If the business wishes to flourish, make some changes very soon.
2;Phenomenally good pizza. Tasted very fresh! Quite a bit over priced though. $45 bucks for two personal sized pizzas. There are definitely better values out there.
0;"I give up.\n\nA friend suggested meeting here for lunch this week. I reluctantly said yes. We were the first ones in. We went to the right and up the few steps to find a table. EVERYONE had dirty chairs and tables with crumbs, obviously from the night before. If i was desperate, there might have been enough food around to make a meal.\n\nAfter looking at each other we decided to try one of the high tops down in the bar area. OK, the chairs were clean and the table top looked clean so we sat. Since there were two of us at a four place, i went to move the salt and pepper out of the way. Not an easy chore since the salt was stuck to the table. Breaking it loose and moving on to move the small appetizer plates, they were stacked for four.\n\nThe top three slide off, the bottom one stuck to the table. The table had that sticky \""someone almost tried to clean it off\"" feeling to it.\n\nTo the waitress' credit, after mentioning the upper chairs and tables she got a towel and went to clean them off after telling us it must have been the night crew's mistake - WELL DUH!\n\nAgain, there's no management at this place. If they would clean up, improve the inconsistent food and get it together, they might do more biz. Maybe they need to call in Restaurant Impossible, OR... just ask their customers. We could all tell them a few things... those of us that care.\n\nAs a note, it was my friend's first time there wanting to try it. She said she'd never be back. . Maybe my standards for cleanliness and good food are higher than some others but... I always tell it like i see it. \n\n...I give up, I'm done with this hole"
2;"A very average bar. Do not be misled by the Irish-seeming name; Casey Moore's is your typical bar with a patio. \n\nPros: near ASU and Mill Ave, and probably cheaper than most around here.\n\nCons: very little indoor seating, and a patio which is only tenable 6 months a year."
4;The brisket blew my mind.While I am no expert,I did grow up in Texas and good bar b q was a regular thing for me growing up.That brisket reminds me of home.
2;Delux sounded really good, so I decided to grab a burger for an early lunch.  I had heard from others that it was really good.   The service was excellent and for that alone, I give Delux 5 stars however..\n\nI ordered a cup of coffee $2.50,  a half order of sweet potato and regular fries $3.5 and the delux burger with bacon and avocado $10.90 (typo in the menu it said $9.90) and $1.50 for the bacon and avocado. It was over $21, crazy!  The bill was high for what I got I think , compared to other restaurants, definitely not worth it.   Fries, awesome, in the top 5 for best sweet potato fries but not the best in town, sorry, I do have my favorites!  The burger was not a tasty as I imagined it to be.  Yes, it was fresh, but it wasn't that tasty even with the extra bacon and avocado, and usually I devour burgers if they are good regardless of the size, this one I didn't. \n\nDelux has a wonderful outside venue and is a great place to hang with friends and maybe share a burger and fries, but I wasn't blown away as I thought I would be.  I gave the restaurant a 3 because of pricing and just the taste of the burger, it wasn't that great.
4;Super fun! Low key. Nice bar staff and Karaoke.\nInexpensive beer.  Just a nice place to relax in a non judgmental place..
4;I cannot sing Patricia's praises enough!  She is truly a gifted massage therapist.  I stumbled upon Patricia via Groupon.  Her Groupon special is quite the bargain especially given her skill level. Patricia is warm, personable, and highly accommodating (I cannot tolerate getting massages from cold, sterile people...especially when you are entrusting your body to them). I enjoyed the high paced energy she brought to my deep tissue massage.  She is meticulous and ensures knots are adequately found and eradicated.  Her aromatherapy techniques and use of heat are highly effective in driving away pain.  She demonstrated a variety of stretches I can utilize to relieve stress and tension.\n\nThe search is over...I have found my massage therapist in Las Vegas!!!
4;Sooo good, had the chefs special fish filet, the shrimp and octopus were cooked to perfection as was the fish, sides were delicious and portions were large. Definitely plan on returning and exploring the menu
4;When we are in Phoenix  for business we tend to eat breakfast here. The food is yummy, the place is small and Matt tends to be around to say hey and help serve up the grub. I like the oatmeal of all things...my husband really likes the scrambles. I love that it's small and homey the food is good and it's not too pricey. Also, I love to give my business to ma and pa places as opposed to, say...IHOP or Denny's. (YUCK)
0;"I feel compelled to write a negative review of this place after giving it a second try since it's constantly listed as a recommended lunch place in my \""nearby\"" search. To say the quality of the food here is \""mediocre\"" is an overstatement. A compliment in fact. Because frankly the food is barely edible. What's worse, one of my pet peeves is when a food establishment calls its food one thing when it's not actually the case. I believe that's called lying. Or at the very least, false advertising. Like when a restaurant claims their orange juice is fresh squeezed when it is actually from a bottle (you know who you are, Eat), or in the case of this terrible place, calling frozen chicken that's been microwaved as grilled. I mean come on. In what world is that the same thing? You can't just get fresh chicken and grill it if you're gonna call it grilled? Such a disappointment when I've paid $10 for my sandwich and taken it to go only to unwrap it and realize it is NOT AT ALL what I expected. Not to mention it tastes bad and is totally unhealthy! Anyway. Never going back here and I hope they read this and revise their descriptions to reflect the truth about the shitty ingredients they offer."
3;If you are buying a TV please go see a young guy named Frank. I went in to look for a new TV for my bedroom. I know ZERO about tvs. 1080dp, LCD, LED vs. plasma? WHAT??? Frank is so knowledgable and hands on. He broke it down for me and now I feel like I can explain it to someone else! I left with my knowlege in hand, went home did my own research and I'm actually going back on Sunday to pick up one of the Samsungs that Frank suggested.
4;I found The Specialist here on yelp and called in a relative state of panic. I had been at work and the office complex neglected to tell us they were painting part of the building. I ended up with a car covered in green paint specs. I called The Specialists and asked a series of questions about how to handle the situation - Theo was both patient and kind - he answered all my questions and told me to bring the car in so he could take a look at it. He was able to remove all of the paint in record time and I was back at work shortly there after. \n\nI recommended them to everyone in my office! \n\nThey are absolutely brilliant!
3;Great store with tons of great pieces and basics.  This is the Uniqlo/GAP/H&M of London.\n\nMuch of the stuff is expensive for what it is, but you can find a good deal.  They have some great shoes and dresses for reasonable prices.  The jewelry section is amazing and I was so tempted to buy a bunch of stuff.  I also like that they have a 10% discount for students, woo.\n\nI bought a cute polka dot dress (somewhat retro), some cute flats, and socks.  Some of the loafers they have are cute and all leather but pricey for what I was looking for... $65 for cheap loafers...  decided to spend that on my dress!  And the dress is machine washable! \n\nSizing is a little odd... I'm usually a 0 or 2, and a 4 in my dress fit me ok.  The 2 was too tight.  Odd.  Definitely need to try before you buy here.  The dressing rooms are spacious and nice.  They're a bit understaffed though.\n\nAll the clothes are on trend and will be standout pieces in your wardrobe... this is more than I can say for Uniqlo/GAP who specialize in the basics.\n\nDefinitely worth a stop to shop.  After I purchased my goods and walked around to other stores and other malls, people actually stopped me to ask me about Topshop.  I guess it's pretty popular since it's so new in Vegas.
3;Great neighborhood joint.  Decent menu.  It can get crowded on Friday and Saturday evenings with long waits.  Great place to watch a game or down a few cold ones.  Service is OK (not bad, but not great).
3;My husband took me here to celebrate my 30th birthday and it was fabulous!!\n\nWhen my hubby booked the reservation he mentioned it was my b-day and they waived our parking fee and sent free wine and cheese to our room-- YUM! \n\nRoom:  Our room was comfortable and clean, great bed-- we are really picky about beds because we have a sleep number bed at home. Loved the shower: spacious, beautiful tiling, pretty good water pressure. Coffee and tea are available in-room. \n\nPositives\n-Beautiful views, especially at night. \n- Nice workout room with very high tech equipment, cold towels and fruit.\n- Special treatment for a special occasion.\n- Misters around the pool during the day to keep you cool\n- Poolside ice water coolers for easy access  \n\nDownside\n- The entire pool is a play pool, no deep water.\n- Hot tubs were too hot to get in and my husband usually wants the hot tub really warm but this would melt your skin off.\n\nSide note: During the summer tons of locals are here with their kids so if you are looking for a romantic getaway go some where pricier-- where parents won't pay just for a day at the pool :) And just a warning I will be bringing my kids here next summer when the rates are cheap :)
2;The old arcade game was excellent and only a few quarters to play.\nDrinks nice enough .\nBartenders were really nice.\n NIce enough place.
3;Nice owners and good tasting food. The prices are very reasonable, and the service is speedy. Comes highly recommended.
2;It's a fun place to hang out with friends.  Indoor/outdoor setting is really nice to wander around.  The live music was fun,  lots of stuff from the early 2000's.\nThe service is mediocre at best.  We were with a big group and the waitress knew she was guaranteed a 20% tip so she barely helped us.  Our drinks were empty for a long time and she never checked on us, we had to ask other waitresses to track her down if we needed something.
4;I have been going to Stacy for my haircuts for close to a year now, and she is the reason I stopped shaving my head and wearing hats (which I had been doing everyday without fail since I was 15). I literally told her to do whatever she thought would be best for my hair and she did.\n\nI now feel like a million bucks, love the way I look when I walk out the door, and I'm regularly complimented on my hair.\n\nStacy is fun, smart, creative, and will make you drool yourself to sleep with her shampooing/conditioning. Haha! Her environment is relaxed, she'll make you laugh, and you'll never think about going somewhere else for your hair needs ever again.
2;The atmosphere is conducive to getting in a good workout. I appreciate that! A group of guys were having the weirdest steam room ritual I've ever seen. A group of 10 guys (sausage fest) would stand or sit for 5 min till a sweat was worked up, then they'd take a walking lap around the pool then back in the sauna. Ooook I guess they were tryna do something! It was weird but motivational. I was inspired to go hard on my workout, so that's what matters. The staff wasn't overly friendly. No greetings or offerings of help, directions or assistance. Oh well.
3;I've always experienced excellent customer service before - and the other night was no exception. Friendly, efficient and courteous throughout. \n\nFor starters, we had the oyster and scallop selection. Oysters were good, however a little on the small side. The scallops were prepared well and they went well with the sauce and sides. \n\nI had the steak special with grilled veggies. Prepared just right and a good sized portion. I didn't want too much as I wanted to save for dessert (somewhere else). \n\nMy friend opted for the ribs special. Now her meat just slid off the bones. She also asked for mash and I really liked her dish better than mine. \n\nBoth meals were delicious and the staff was awesome. It's a little on the pricey side however I'd still come back even if I didn't have a ton of gift cards to use up
1;I stopped here in August when my band was on tour. We decided to busk in the plaza before our show that night, and I needed some food that didn't come from the cooler in our van. Not wanting a huge portion of food and trying to eat healthy, I took a change on a roll of sushi and a seaweed salad. I thought that since I didn't order anything that needed to be cooked, it wouldn't take too long. After waiting for way longer than is necessary to make sushi, they told me they were out of seaweed salad and offered me a replacement or a refund (of which I took the latter). Again, I waited a pretty ridiculous amount of time and eventually got my roll. It was tiny, but it tasted alright. Employees were nice. All in all, about what you might expect from a tiny Asian food stand next to the plaza. Probably wouldn't go back.
2;How incredibly adorable!! Practical Art is just what the name implies - tons of items that are beautiful works of art that have the bonus of being able to be used in your everyday life - cooking dinner, having a glass of wine, relaxing in the living room, sending greetings to friends and so much more.\n\nMost of the items are for the home and sadly aren't the style of mine, which makes it hard to buy for myself here. However, I have a feeling this will be a potential gift spot for friends for years to come. And I just realized, people may now try to vie for my friendship or get engaged just knowing of potential gifts they will receive. \n\nThe employee that was there was really nice as I aimlessly walked about, but after seeing the special offer on yelp of iced tea or tequila, I'm suddenly sad I wasn't offered any.
2;"I love indian food and I consider Tamarind as Pittsburgh's one of the best indian places. The portions are generous and service is great. \n\nI got the usual chicken tikki masala and the sauce was great to dip in my garlic naan. My bf got some lamb dish with green sauce ( I dont remember the name) which had unique great flavor as well. I asked my dish to be spicy but it was not. I know I am pretty good with spicy food but I know how HOT Indian food can get. So this one thing put me down a little on my visit but other than this, the soft chicken went well with fluffy white rice warm naan. The lamb was tender too and didn't give off that \""lamb smell\"" much. \n\nEverytime I go back to Pittsburgh, Tamarind is always on my \""must go back\"" list. \nThe staff will greet you kindly, prices are reasonable for the generous portions, and the food comes out quick enough so you don't start to get frustrated. \n\nI would give 3.5 stars. Even though it is my fav indian place in Pittsburgh, I feel like there is a better place somewhere out there. So as of now, it is a 3.5 for me~"
2;"I've only had takeout. No major complaints. I would order for a reliable hot meal, but so far nothing has blown my mind.\n\nThe lamb curry was kind of spicy but besides that not as flavorful as I would prefer. Supposedly comes with yogurt but if it's in the sauce I couldn't tell. Next time will ask for it as a side as well. Generous with the lamb; lots of big, delicious pieces in my dish! Would've liked some more veggies or something to break up the broth in addition to the meat.\n\nChicken 65 was pretty good and the naan was great but I've never seen a restaurant mess up naan.\n\nGotta go back for the buffet. It's kind of expensive to do takeout from here so that should be a more affordable way to sample the menu."
2;They've done a nice job with this new ballpark.  I wish there was more than just a bunch of chain restaurants surrounding it at Mesa Riverview.
1;I don't get the love for this hotel? We stayed there for 2 nights promised a view of the pool but got a room with a view of the roof waited in line for 1 1/2 hr to get checked in on a Friday night only 2 people at the counter. They do not care ! Valet always full. Was given bogus advice on where to pick up luggage on departure. We couldn't wait to leave this hotel\nBest experience was initial bellman \nWorst experience was checking in\nBuffet was very good I would not go back\nJim d
1;Everything here was just average. Average burgers and average pasta dishes. Nothing set them apart from a standard chain restaurant. The prices were fine and the waiter we has was great but this is the kind of place I won't really seek out to go again.
3;All I can say is jalape\u00f1o bacon!!!!!! \n\nOkay really wanted the best or one of the best burgers in Vegas OTS. After several reviews we decided to give it a shot. Decided on the Kobe with cheddar and all the fix ins. Gf had the black angus beef w/jalapeno bacon, cheese, shared fries and had a beer. Bartender recommended an IPA for me (delicious, creamy not too heavy and potent). I am coming to the realization that I am not a huge Kobe fan but for some reason I keep trying. Fries came first, average steak fries with Good ranch. Burgers came and mine was okay. GF's burger was awesome. Perfectly cooked-med-but it was the jalapeno bacon that made the meal. It was spicy and delicious a must try. I would definitely return and try more beer other options and dessert!
0;$11 bucks! For mixed drinks! 8 bucks for a shot of Cuervo *%@#!! I didn't have to pay to get in tho (usually $10), so I guess it evened out that night. We had vip seating (upstairs) this night and after the first bottle of Goose was finished they said a second bottle was $250!! I wasn't paying for any of it tho.:) This club is nothing special. One side of the club has some good energy to it, but packed.  The female employees are very attractive (the go go's in particular) and some of the women who patronage are attractive as well.  Seems like this place is starting to go down hill and lose money that is possibly the reason for price hikes. One thing that bothers me about this place is the tripping hazards there is a step off around the tables on a black floor, plus I was already getting my stumble on, (nearly fell) the stairs are a little tough on me as this point as well.  It does have a little pizza nook attachment to it outside, which taste great after a night of empty stomach drinking, and its a good way to start sobering up. But you could just go to a club that serves food as well. This place is pretty much your token club, before the decline in atmosphere and the hike in prices I would have given this places 3 stars which is average overall but, now I wouldn't waste my money going.\n\nI think the writing is on the wall for this place's chances of staying open for another couple years, without some type of revamp.
3;Dropped in for a coffee to go...it's damn good coffee!  It tasted familiar and I asked if they roasted their beans or ordered it from somewhere in Canada and the barista let me know the beans I was having was from 49th Parallel in Vancouver!  So Vancourites, if you're missing your awesome coffee from home you should drop by here.\n\nI also ordered a scone which was also delicious and was on my way.  I'm not to sure about the amenities at the shop but it's a cool little space but I think the people watching might be at a minimum unless something is happening at the convention center since it's off a smaller street in Old MTL.\n\nOh yeah - staff was really friendly
1;"\""That's it?\"" \n\nThese words started - and ended - the night.\n\nThe first time it was said because I had a dumb moment. Stupid me thought the restaurant would be at the very top of the tower. I realized that wasn't true when the elevator ride up to the restaurant was all of 5 seconds. Kinda took the magic of Paris away.\n\nWhat I was also hoping was that the food would be better. If it's any consolation, the escargot was great. It was my first time eating this dish, and I really enjoyed the textures that came through. Well done. The \""warm\"" lobster salad came out COLD and it was also quite bland. It also was difficult to eat. Do NOT order it. The rest of our food was overcooked and overseasoned. My seabass was dry, and my boyfriend's ahi tuna was practically cooked all the way through. He wasn't too happy with this and even offered his two cents for my Yelp review (which he never usually does). Salvation came at the end of the meal in the form of creme brulee. At least the French really know their desserts. In spite of all this, the service was very attentive and superb. They deserved their tip that night.\n\nMy advice is that if the view of the strip and Bellagio fountain show really matter all that much to you, then go ahead and have dinner here. But if you really want the main event to be your food, take your money elsewhere."
0;"Good points: Nice server, good wine, great location. \n\nBad points: Food. Food. Food. \n\nFirst problem: The menu had very little to choose from. The same ingredients that make up a particular pizza can also be found in salad or entree form. \n\nHere's the rest of the play-by-play: \nBread and oil - The bread was pretty good, home-made and salty. \nAppetizers:\n 1)Proscuitto wrapped mushrooms stuffed with risotto - Decent. Nothing to write home about. Clever idea but the sauce and filling were bland.\n2) Baked brie and jam wrapped in pastry: I'm a good home cook, not great. However, this is a dish that I've made at home and it turned out much better. The brie was either under-heated or just poor quality, because it was not as melted as any of us expected. Also, this dish was surprisingly salty.\nEntrees: \n1) Cheese pizza: just like Domino's makes it. But more salt.\n2) Chorizo and manchego risotto: Chorizo was fine, risotto was chunky.\n3) Shrimp linguine: Again, good idea, just needs alot of work.\n4) Mushroom and spinach risotto: Worst part of the meal. I will never go back because of this. The risotto was chewy and mushy, the spinach was all but raw, and it was topped with, you guessed it, lots of salt. I ate a few bites because I was hungry, but couldn't bring my self to try to get full on it. The server claims they make the risotto with \""a cream base, which is why alot of people don't like it.\""\n\nThe next thing I will want to say is that the \""white wine\"" list included Rosso Dolce. If you're thinking to yourself \""Rosso sounds like red,\"" you're right! I ordered it off the white list and was surprised when I was given a glass filled with deep red. It was wonderful, and the sweetest red I've ever had, but when we brought this to the servers attention she said it was on the wrong list because it was sweet. She also struggled to answer the question \""Is the zin red or white?\"" \n\nAs I said the service was very friendly, and the chef graciously accomodated a request (one which wasn't on the menu) for a member in our party. \nThe place has great potential, but they really need to work to reach it."
2;I am not a huge fan of Vietnamese sandwiches... or really sandwiches in general.  But I love the egg rolls here.  You can get a whole box of them for like $20 and they are really tasty so its a great thing to pick up for a party.  Way better than the frozen kind and just as cheap.
1;Definitely not worth going to, unless you have the Groupon or some sort of crazy deal. I used the $75 Groupon that covered a starter, 2 salads/soups, 2 entrees, a side to share and 2 desserts. Asked for a medium cooked Filet Mignon and very clearly was given rare/seared. Mediocre steak and quality, would not go again and that showed! Seating for at least 250 and there was about 15 people on a Saturday at 7pm.
3;We came here to end our evening with a couple drinks. Some sort of special event dinner was taking place inside, so we opted to sit outside. But the restaurant space looked very modern and warm.\n\nAnyway, outside....GORGEOUS!\n\nWhat a view! What a fire pit! LOVE. The drinks weren't expecially cheap, but the view made up for it. We even met some 'interesting' people around the fire pit.\n\nDPOV is a definite must-do if you're staying in the area.
1;I'm disappointed that I'm disappointed with Sunset Grille. I went with a fellow Yelper to use a Groupon I had and I wanted to like this place since I'm always looking for new spots in Dilworth but just had a meh experience.  \n\nThey brought us these little fried dough balls, sprinkled with powdered sugar. I was on it like white on rice. They best way I could describe them was like a soft funnel cake ball. Unfortunately, that was the best part of my experience there. \n\nThe prices for the salads were absolutely insane. If you wanted salmon, chicken, shrimp or tuna it, an additional $5! I could've been the frugal girl I am and just brought my own in because I refuse to pay that much for a measly portion of meat on my salad. I ordered the large portion of the Sonoma County Salad It came out quickly and there it was, a glorified greek salad (mental note, ask sister who lives in Sonoma County what their salad exactly is). Maybe I was expecting more for a large salad  since the ingredients sang to me.  Don't get me wrong, it was good but if I would have gotten meat on it and paid $13 for this salad, I would have been very disappointed. Other said Yelper got the Asian chicken salad and it looked like something you would get at Wendy's. Hers was $13 and it she kept calling it a $5.99 salad. If I am going out to spend that much money on something like a salad, I want something substantial that will fill me, not a small plate of lettuce with a few add ins. I know, it's Dilworth and all and the rent is probably a  little high but I think I will just stick to Harris Teeter if I am looking for a bulky salad in the future. Sorry, Sunset Grille, I won't be back.
4;I was originally attracted to this place by the bright color scheme, chic decor, and relaxing music. It seemed like a nice place to have lunch. Many such places use this as a ruse, then don't deliver on the menu. No so at Distrito. Everything we ordered was delightful. We started off with their fresh, crisp tortilla chips and a thick and chunky (as it should be) guacamole. Excellent. Then there was the ceviche: the lemon sorbet they put on top added a nice texture and perfectly complimented the dish. \nFor an entree, I had the carnitas and my friend had the mahi mahi fish tacos. Both were exquisite. I was impressed by how they took simple dishes and tweaked them slightly to create something altogether new and exciting.  This was a great lunch experience. I hope to return here soon.
1;Everything is just too sweet here...My teeth were literally in shock - The frosting is too sweet that it overpowers the cake and then your taste buds are too drunk from sugar that you can't even taste the actual cake. \nThis was my second time here wich ended with the same result - If I'm in this area I'm going to Retro Bakery!!!\nThe gentleman (owner) is extra polite - I think he said Thankyou like 50 times when I was there. Now there's absolutly nothing wrong with having manners but it was Thankyou overload. \nHere's what I tried:\n-Strawberry = I lked the fact that real strawberries are mixed in the cake but the frosting is so sweet that you wouldn't even notice..\n-Cookies and Cream = So sweet the oreo on top had no taste...\n-Lemon Cream Cheese = Too sweet, where's the cream cheese?\n-Pumpkin Spice = This was by far the best of the bunch. It was sweet (as cupcakes should be) but it wasn't too overpowering. I liked this combination.\nThe  interior needs some decor...As a consumer I like having a variety of places to go to so I hate to see a buisness fail. I don't wish that for this buisness - just take it easy with the sugar please....
2;"I shop here most of the time I go to the mall since it is one of the anchor stores. I find at least something to buy there most of the time. It can be very tough to use their big coupons....so many things are ineligible!  But that also means that they have alot of things on clearance and listed as incredible value or best buy. However, my parents have plenty of luck using their $50 off $100 coupons. They have \""saved\"" so much money using them. And they come once a month. Selection is OK and they have a good amount of petites. Service is hit or miss. You have some very helpful folks but you also have some don't seem to give a crap."
3;Dropped by to have a cigar and some lunch. Good selection of drafts, nothing exotic but good beers. Food selection is limited, I had wings and they were great. good atmosphere and the outdoor space was great. It wasn't a really hot day and sat outside and smoked my cigar. They don't allow glass out there is the only problem.\nBiggest asset they have is Carly, what a sweetheart and service was great.\nWill me more of a regular now for sure..
4;"Funny story here, we had reservations for the restaurant, but since we arrived around four minutes  early, they didn't want to let us in (\""we were too early\""). We thought that was so stuffy--but we were expecting that since the menu de gestacion is around $300. So we walked outside the restaurant (which is actually inside the casino) and saw that there was L'atelier next door to the \""high end\"" Robuchon (2 same restaurants next to each other). We went to see their menu because we wondered what the difference was--it seemed like the same stuff on the menu..So we asked, and in a very diplomatic manner we were told that what you really pay for is the \""ambiance\"" (i.e. ATTITUDE--which we got when we walked into the first one), because the food was the same but for much less! Well--in that case let's get a seat now! So we ate at L'atelier instead for a couple hundered dollars less! \nEverything that is said by the reviewers that give this restaurant 5 stars is absolutely true..This is really la cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me as far as menus go--WOW. *Everything* we had was done so perfectly: perfect seasoning, perfectly cooked, perfectly presented--the FLAVORS--wow! NO WONDER it got a michelin rating! This is the type of restaurant that is *absolutely* worth the splurge. My husband also got the plate of tarts/pies for his birthday, and they were absolutely delicious. I can't remember what we had exactly, what stood out was the dessert we had; I can't remember what it was called, but it was like a pineapple custard, and I think they whipped some coconut cream until it was very light and airy (must have had heavy cream--it was SO decadent) topped with a caramel crisp... It doesn't sound extraordinary (I didn't think it did), but it blew us away..Also, we sat in the bar area WAY in the back, so the bartender (a very cordial gentleman) was helping us, and he gave great recommendations, including an apple WINE..Now we thought what you must be thinking--probably some expensive cider! To our pleasant surprise it really did taste like a delicious dessert wine, it didn't taste at all like apple juice/cider. It is a canadian wine and the apples freeze on the trees, leaving a very sweet residue that is extracted together with the bit of juice--honestly, you've never tasted anything like this! It's called \""Neige\"" and we plan to buy a bottle! Anyway, this restaurant was amazing--hopefully we can come back for a special occasion!!"
3;The course was in tip top shape when I played yesterday.  My only advice is that the greens don't hold.  Apparently they are fairly new, and I would say they are like trying to get a ball to stop on a pool table.  So firm that it's tough to get a repair tool in them.  Super fast, and super firm cost me at least 10 strokes.  Pace of play was about 4 hours, had lunch in the clubhouse after and our service was perfect.  I think her name was Michelle, and she did a great job.
2;"Went there last night for dinner.  Since my companion lives in the \""historic\"" area of Phoenix, said it's been there since forever.   Really??    I didn't even know it existed, albeit I don't drive that street much, but I've been here forever as well.   The host asked if we had reservations.    We had although we surely didn't need them.    I don't like tomato-based Italian sauce; therefore, I ordered the sole in white wine lemon caper sauce.   The side was fettuccine Alfredo.    I had the server put extra Parmesan on everything since I like Parmesan on my Italian dishes.   He ordered the lasagna.    As I said, I don't like tomato-based Italian dishes.     I tried a bite of his.    I thought it was ho hum.   They brought french bread to the table.   Another ho hum item.    It would have been better if it was warm and a bit of a heavier bread.     It was just white bread in french bread style.     I asked the server for her suggestion of a good heavy-bodied red.   She suggested the Michele Chiarlo Barbera D'Asti.    Although it's the most expensive on the wine list per glass, I thought it was barely drinkable.   There were too many interruptions by the staff.    In addition to our server, there were two other people asking if we wanted this or that.   They would show up at the table right after the other one had barely left.    I mean, my fish and pasta was good.     Would I go back?    I dunno.   Plenty of Italian restaurants in town."
0;Projector was horribly out of focus(we do screening rooms for a living so it's not that I forgot my glasses)) - notified the server who sent the manager over - told him the same thing and as assured they would address it.   Watched the whole movie out of focus - will not return.
0;"Here is my detailed review:\n\nI went here for my birthday with my wife after reading the great reviews of this place.  It was a Friday night, so the place was packed.  Be that as it may, the wait was reasonable (20-25 minutes).  The place was buzzing and it got me really excited about the food.  I waited with bated breath to get a taste of the food that all of these people were getting so hyped up about.  The anticipation was mounting heavily, not only because of the buzz, but because I have failed to find a place in the area that makes a half-way decent pizza.  Maybe, I thought, just maybe, I've finally found the place.\n\nWe get seated, waitress comes over, I order a Guinness and me and the wifey order an app which consisted of mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, basil, bread, pepperoncini peppers, and some oil to dip it all in.  It was decent.  The bread was extremely heavy on the rosemary.  It wasn't out of this world, but I couldn't complain all that much.\n\nFor entrees,   me and my wife both ordered 10\"" thin crust pizzas.  I ended up getting a buffalo chicken pizza and she got a deluxe pizza.  The first thing that I noticed when the pizzas came was that, whomever cut it, either had a sense of humor, didn't care, or just didn't know how to cut a pizza.  \n\nNormally, when you get a pizza, the pizza is cut into 8, triangular sections.  However, Nello's fails to provide its customers with this modern convenience, instead opting to cut the thin crust pizza more like a flat bread, but in random, strange angles.  What this ends up creating is shear frustration as now, in order to not make a mess, I must dissect my pizza like some sort of stupid jigsaw puzzle.  If I wanted to solve a jigsaw puzzle, I would've bought one.  But all I wanted was a slice of pizza.\n\nAnd do you think that it was worth all the hassle?  Of course not.  My wife's pizza was under seasoned.  Indeed, upon its creation there was n'er a salt shaker in sight.  The buffalo chicken pizza, on the other hand, was the exact opposite and I mean this to the utmost extreme as it tasted as if the \""chef\"" dumped an entire salt shaker on the thing.  It tasted horrible.\n\nOn top of this, the crust was far from crispy.  When you order a thin crust pizza, you expect the crust to be crispy.  However, in our case, it was not crispy largely because the pizza was under cooked.  Normally, you're looking for the pizza to have a golden brown bottom when cooked.  The bottom of this pizza was pure white, which says to me that either the \""chef\"" in the back doesn't know what he/she is doing, or doesn't even care.\n\nSo, I thought that, maybe, they just can't cook a thin crust pizza.  Their normal crust appeared, at first glance, to be more along the lines of a \""Chicago style\"" crust.  So, out of curiosities sake, I ordered a large, pepperoni pizza to go.\n\nI took it home, and of course the box was chock full of packs of crushed red pepper flake, a topping that I've never heard of going on top of a pizza in my entire life until I moved to Arizona.  In fact, I've never even heard the two in the same sentence before.  Needless to say, I discarded those.\n\nNow, in case you've never had a \""Chicago style\"" pizza before, let me inform you of how it is supposed to be.  It's a deep dish style pizza with a thick, chewy crust, and is loaded with toppings.  A good \""Chicago style\"" pizza can even be eaten with a fork and knife because it's more like a pie then anything else.  A beautiful, tomato, cheese, and meat pie.\n\nWhat I got here was far from that.  Again, the pizza was underdone.  There was hardly any cheese on it, the crust was more like white bread than pizza crust (are they even using pizza dough?  There is a difference between pizza dough and bread dough - pizza dough contains more gluten than normal bread dough).  It had absolutely no flavor at all as, again, it was under seasoned.  I mean, I guess that I can't blame them there - things like garlic, basil, and salt (especially salt!) are pretty dang exotic.\n\nI think that what disturbs me even more than my experience with this place is how vehemently people defend this place and how insistent they are that this place serves good pizza.  What, are you people paid to write these reviews or something?  If you truly think that this place serves a good pizza, then frankly, you have no clue as to what a pizza is.  In fact, you don't have any clue as to what something even closely resembling a pizza is.  I truly pity you all.\n\nAnd for those of you that are insistent on the fact that the place is good because it makes good salads - come on.  How hard is it to make and dress a salad?  Their salad dressing is good, you say?  Yeah, it's really hard to mix up red wine vinegar with extra virgin olive oil, some salt, pepper, garlic, and oregano, isn't it?  Phew, I'm breaking a sweat just thinking about it."
4;I walk in, sit down, and they already know what I want. They've never forgotten me from the past time i was here. This is customer service. Love is place.
2;"***yet again, ANOTHER update***\n\nI docked this location one more star, down to three. The man that runs this store seems to follow whatever hours he pleases. I have now driven out to get boba a total of three times, two of which he wasn't even open (during his posted business hours), and the third of which he didn't have any boba ready. What an idiot.  Please don't make me dock you a fourth star. \n\n****UPDATE*****\nI have demoted Lollicup by one star, sadly. They open at 10 am daily so I thought this morning, \""hey, I'll grab the boy and we'll get some boba after work this morning\"". So I run home, grab they boy, and we make the trip to Avondale for some delicious milk tea. We get there around 10:10, I can hardly contain my excitement as I run up to the counter, \""two boba milk teas, please!\""\n\n....only to hear, \""Oh, no boba right now\"".\n\n *jaw drops* \n\n\""WHAT?! are you out? what's going on?\""\n\n\""No, no, it's still cooking\""\n\n\""...oookay, when will it be ready?\""\n\n\""At least 11\""\n\n\""ELEVEN?! Are you serious?!\""\n\n\""Sorry..\""\n\nOkay, HUGE letdown. Seriously though, why the hell do you open at 10 when your product isn't ready 'til 11?! Why can't he start making it an hour earlier? I just don't understand this. At all. And I was super pissed cause I spent like $5 on gas and went home empty-handed. Seriously. Seriously. Oh! They're also closed on Mondays. So if you're in the mood for some boba, make sure it's Tuesday through Sunday AFTER 11 am. \n\n*******\n\nI've already put in my two cents about Lollicup and how wonderful their boba is. HOWEVER, I just discovered this location and it's 8 miles closer to my house than the Chandler location. Hello BOBA!"
3;One of the tastiest steaks I've ever had (bone in ribeye).: clutch\nPopcorn Rock shrimp: clutch\nFrench fries: clutch\nMac--cheese: NOT clutch\nBeer selection: clutch\nCustomer service: aiight\n\nI brought my two year old and the booth worked out clutch \nwife had the sea bass: clutch.
0;This is probably the worst Cracker Barrel I have ever visited. Apparently they did not schedule properly for a Good Friday crowd. We waited about 10 minutes to even put our name on the waiting list because the hostess couldn't figure out how to take names and call names at the same time. Then we were seated and had to enjoy our brunch next to a filthy table because they did not schedule bus boys for today and it sat empty with plates and food thrown everywhere the entire time we ate!  Really?!  Get with it Cracker Barrel!
2;C'\u00e9tait ben correct, beau bon pas cher. Service relaxe, la place n'Est pas grande. C'est une bonne place relaxe pour faire un plein rapide. rien de wow! le pain est frais et bon. J'ai mang\u00e9 un sandwich de ch\u00e8vre avec pacane. pas mal.
2;I honestly hate to give bad reviews but I did have several problems at this location.\n\nTo start off I did like the staff and the ladies at the front desk were more than helpful, however when it came to getting a call back from my service advisor it was really lacking. I think I got two calls back in the whole 2 weeks I worked with them. Also, my car had been in the shop for 7 days and it didnt even come out with good body work. \nI did make them aware that I was unhappy with some of the work and they nicely got it fixed for me when I was out of town. They even towed my car to the shop and home free of charge.
1;Visited here on a Tuesday morning for their breakfast buffet using a 25% off ACG coupon.  There was a fairly long, slow moving line at the cashier stand in order to be seated.\n\nService was AWFUL.  I had already practically finished my first plate before a server came around to bring drinks, and then only after I had asked another server is anyone was assigned to my section.  No excuse for that.  Also had to ask for the one refill I managed to get on my coffee.\n\nThe food was decent, except for a piece of beef of some kind that could not be cut with a knife or chewed.  \n\nMy experience at Flavors buffet at Harrah's the next morning was much better.
4;Very good traditional breakfast food. Portions are huge. Definitely can split an entree. Good service good prices
4;Our second visit and everything was wonderful - great beer, food and friendly, attentive service.   Plan on many more visits and will highly recommend this establishment to our friends.
0;They were so rude! Which doesn't bother me as bad as the poor food! I had the Alfredo and my chicken was cold. My sister had the chicken pasta and said her broccoli was almost frozen. Won't go here again!
0;If you want to get the squirts, order their frittata (which sucked BTW - bland, very little pesto sauce, veggies, hidden by a mound of bitter greens. I couldn't tell if I was eating a salad on an omelette or the other way around).  The cafe latte was good, but small for a 'regular' sized coffee.  I was hoping to have a filling breakfast, butt, in the next several hours, everything came back out...
1;I went there last night for the very first time and the food was delicious. I showed up 45 minutes before closing time and the lady up front said I was still able to stay and eat but the chefs stopped cooking the food so I basically had to settle for the food that was leftover which was cool because there was more then enough to feed this beast. The only thing that I had a problem with which is very common in Asian restaurants was the horrible customer service. The staff was so eager to go home that they rushed us out of the restaurant. They must have asked if we were done about 5 times and started to clean and get rid of all the food before we even got done eating. I thought the staff was very rude and unprofessional. This place is delicious but the workers need to take a customer service class or two.
0;My husband and I ate at Bouchon in Vegas as part of our twentieth wedding anniversary celebration. Expecting an amazing meal given it is a Kheller establishment, we were unfortunately very disappointed.   Our first impression was soured by the two men in suits at the podium when we arrived. We assumed at least one of them was the maitre de, but as neither acknowledged us, we couldnt say. We waited standing literally right in front of the podium for several minutes and neither ever acknowledged us. Finally, a young woman took pity on us and handled our seating. So much for being welcomed at Bouchon. \nOn to the meal....\nWe ordered the bone marrow appetizer. Tasty, but served at room temperature rather than warm which, frankly, was a bit gross.\nSardine salad was swimming in oil and no acid at all, ether lemon or vinegar was discernable, to cut all of that oil.  We sent it back. \nThe entrees, trout for hubby and sole for me, were so oversalted, they were barely edible.\nWe did not bother to stay for dessert.
1;Just overall a blah experience.  The service was decent but nothing special and the food was just not hitting the spot whatsoever.\nI ordered the margharita pizza assuming I couldn't go wrong but I did...I went very very wrong.  The sauce on the pizza was water and almost flavorless, the crust was decent but the pizza itself was very doughy and soggy.  I couldn't taste any basil and the mozzarella wasn't fresh.  No fresh tomatoes, just a runny sauce.  Not very good at all.\n\nTwo others ordered the penne vodka (not on the menu) and added chicken.  The chicken looked like it was on the floor in the back of the restaurant, collecting dirt, getting stepped on and then heated up in a microwave to just ensure it was nice and shriveled.  Rubbery, tough, flavorless.  Gross.  The vodka sauce was again sub par.  Just not good!!\n\nOne of my other dining partners got the clam sauce and he said it was okay but nothing that great.  \n\nOur starter salads were decent but again just not great.  The bread served prior the meals was okay.  \n\nWe weren't offered dessert but the desserts in the cooler looked old and stale.  \n\nOverall, I would never make the trip to come to this particular location again.  Others mentioned how great it is at the Park Road location so I am willing to give that one a try.
3;"I have been to the Stratosphere Tower observation deck itself twice (both during the daytime) and the views of the Vegas strip and beyond are nothing but fantastic. The only thing I wish is that their prices weren't so expensive ($16 adult admission, additional $12-15 if you go on any of their other rides at the top).\n\nThere is both an outdoor and indoor observation deck when you reach the top via elevator (you're going up 108 floors). Clearly, I must think people who go on the Stratosphere tower rides are absolutely out of their mind because of the fact you are literally hanging over the edge at times. But hey, that's just me; I could not see myself going on such kinds of rides even if I had the money and guts to do so."
1;Honestly, the only reason I ever come in here is to use their bathroom.  So, the only reason the shops is even getting 2 stars is because they are kept relatively clean.  I cannot even tell you what shops are in this place.
0;The crowd has a lot of undesirables and rift-raft. I dont want/need uber exclusive but its nice to go out to a nightclub where at least people look the part.  My GF commented that the guys were super ugly. Even the bouncers sort of the looked goofy and academic.  Forget about what people looked like, they were basically a lot of wierdo's. \n\nPerhaps I stopped by on a off night, but it I would have to agree that the crowd was not attractive.  If your gonna go out, might as well choose a place that has a sexy crowd. otherwise why deal with the headaches, might as well have a fun night at O-Shea's
1;2 stars only because the pizza was good. WORST delivery driver EVER. He should be fired. Called me to ask where he was supposed to deliver and i was like what the heck i gave you guys the address and he said he has the address but he's not gonna drive around trying to find the hotel. Are you serious? He had the most unpleasant attitude and demeanor when he finally arrived. Oh and before that, someone calls me from the restaurant asking me for my credit card number. I was like,  uh i am not giving you that since i ordered through grubhub. The guy on the other line figured out he was calling the wrong person and apologized but i mean still...calling a cuatomer for their credit card number is just funny business. I'll pass on this place next time I'm in vegas.
1;"Normally I like Pei Wei (it's the predictable \""faster food\"" second channel of PF Chang, and the recipes are fresh, flavorful and fast.)  Unfortunately, this location kind of sucks.  Most of the tables in the place were either dirty or had been left half-bussed.  Clean plates and napkins weren't on the tables ready to go like they usually are at Pei Weis.  And my dinner companion for some reason got an entree that was about half the size of everyone else's.  Overall we just got the feeling it wasn't well managed.  Unless this location is within walking distance of your place, try the one on South Eastern Avenue going into Anthem - it's always clean and efficient."
1;I only had some wine and two small dishes so I feel like my review is semi incomplete. I had the sliced beef app that came with bread. It was ok to not good. Very dry and virtually no flavor. The baked brie with lavender honey and apples was awesome. Totally redeemed the flavorless beef appetizer. The wine was great. I had three glasses of Sauvignon blanc. The service was ok not to very good. The waitress had no idea what she was talking about. She must be new. That's fine...I can understand and be ok with that. But it probably would've been better if she just said so. She almost messed up my friend'a order but I quickly realized she was talking about the wrong dish. My friend was asking about the fish sandwich and she was explaining the ceviche. She said it was raw. I said there's no way your fish sandwich is raw. And she insisted the fish was so good it could be served raw. I insisted she was wrong. She checked with the kitchen. Sure enough she was wrong and admitted she was describing the ceviche. Which technically isn't raw since the juices cook the fish but I digress. Anyway, yeah, service not so great. Food not so great minus the brie. Wine good. Will I go back? Doubtful. For paying that much for apps--one of which was flavorless--I doubt I would be willing to pay a lot for a main dish. But I suppose the other dishes might be pretty good.
3;In all the years I have eaten here, I have never been sick.
2;"I was seriously thinking about giving this place two stars but my husband reminded me that the price was actually pretty reasonable for Vegas.  I compare all Vegas buffets to the Champagne brunch at the Bellagio, which is pretty amazing. But you pay for it. Really, my main problem with Wicked Spoon was that I wanted breakfast but they had mostly lunch/dinner items in their \""brunch\"" service.  There was just one guy at the omelette station and he was working his a$$ off because at 11am in Vegas most people are just barely waking up and that was the only egg option in the buffet.  They also had some pancakes that looked like they had been sitting out way too long and some waffles which I tried but didn't finish because they were really soggy.\n\nI like the concept of the small individual portions instead of the huge trays like most buffets.  It is visually much more appealing. But don't fool yourself into thinking that they didn't prepare that dish in bulk and then plate it up and leave it under the heat lamps for an hour. You can tell that after the first bite. Some of the items were room temperature which is not good. They weren't too busy when we were there so maybe that's why? I don't know, I guess that's a problem for all buffets. It didn't stop me from getting some of the Mac and cheese in the cute little skillet or edamame in the chinese takeout box."
2;Love to go for brunch on Sunday's. The food is always great but the service can be slow. If you're not in a hurry, enjoy the atmosphere...that's half the reason you should go there. They are supposed to have great bloody mary's however last time we were there they ran out of their mix and instead of telling us they ran out, they made a new mix with whole tomatoes. Although I give them credit for improvising I couldn't even drink through the straw it was so thick! It also had absolutely no flavor.  I ended up paying for a whole tomato in a glass even after I told the waitress I was unhappy with the drink. The food was delicious!
2;Cute little atmosphere, nothing too fancy here. Just order, pick  up and go, or order sit and eat. Simple. We stumbled in about 30 minutes to close and were pleased with the service. Most restaurant employees seem to get upset when you walk in anytime after an hour before close. These employees were kind, and did not seem bothered at all that we were there. \n\nWe ordered the sweet and sour chicken and the pork fried rice. The sweet and sour chicken was the bomb! The chicken was fresh with a light crispy crust, the sauce was perfectly balanced between sour and sweet and the plate was big and full. Not to mention the healthy serving of veggies chopped up in big chunks and spread around the chicken. The pork friend rice however wasn't my favorite. It was very generic fried rice with strips of chewy pork. Bleck. I will not be ordering that again. \n\nI would have most likely given this joint 4 out of 5 stars however nearing the end of our meal one of the chefs came out and let out a huge burp in front of us. Not exactly professional or appetizing. I would definitely order take out from here. I might not dine in again though as the experience turned out to be a little confusing.
3;love the owner PETER ! great hands ! GREAT massage ! salon is gorgeous , cleaned , tools are sanitized , brand new files and buffers and pumice !
0;"WTF x+&..)!  I graduated college, went to law school and passed the Bar the first time, and have done nearly 90 criminal jury trials.  I thought I was smart enough to do my homework before plunking down $210 for BMG.  What a dummy!  Wish I had read the reviews before falling for the \""myth and mystic\"" of this show!  First hint it was a dud was the half empty audience.  Then, the VOICE kept making those dumb jokes as the words passed on the screen -- bit o advice: move on after three times.  The show started out good enough, with a great percussion piece -- and I thought, great, everything I'd heard about the BMG experience.  But then the guys started with the throwing-catching marshmellows (or whatever) -- and this went on for, like, 10 minutes.....!  2nd bit of advice:  move on!  Then, they grab some lady from the audience for a skit.  Fine.  But, for TWENTY minutes.  My God, I've seen grass grow faster in that time span.  And then they have this 1999-dated sequence about the Internet -- oooh, ahhh, ummmmm......DATED!  Then the Western Neon show thing -- fine, but no Blue Men.  What are they doing?  Taking a pee?  Then they grab another dude, paint him, press him against a canvas, and send him back....?  Wow, yeah, that was really.....dull.  Finally, they managed to spray some people in the first few rows with some kind of liquid -- guess it made their day, although it looked like they just sweated in their tarps the entire show.\n      I knew the show was going to be underwhelming within the first 10 minutes, and I just had to hope it would get better for the next 80 minutes, which it didn't.  It's a good show for a 5-year-old, maybe 10 at the most.  Frankly, I didn't mind that they didn't talk; that's the novelty.  But there's just very little that's entertaining about this show.  I guess I'm one of the people that just didn't get it.  Sorry, I don't like being so negative. But I am being honest.  Go see any of Cirque shows, or Phantom -- money well spent."
2;i wasnt as impressed as i thought i would be. The food was good but i think I was expecting more based on the great reviews. I didn't care for the fresh spring roll, it was not like any other fresh spring rolls I've ever had. It was more like a sausage roll with some veggies and glass noodles rolled in a dough. The silver noodle salad medium spicy was good.
0;"We came here with a group of 9. A few of us had maybe 2 spoon fulls of left overs when we were done eating the \""all you can eat sushi.\"" 3 people had 2 bites of salad. One had a bite of rice left. One person had a spoon full of soup at the bottom of her bowl. When we were done the server came over & told us if we didn't finish those last bites of our food they would have to charge extra to the whole table. Really? What if we didn't like the food? You would still make us eat it? Then the server didn't know how to ring up the bill & tried charging us extra anyway. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone! It's like a prison camp where they are constantly watching us eat and checking our plates as they take each one away! Not a good way to keep customers coming back. Oh and they put extra rice in every sushi roll to get you full faster..."
4;If your looking for a place to get authentic Italian food, look no further. Great Italian born owners and staff make this cafe the best place in town for a quick lunch or a long cappuccino break.
0;I'm not sure where to begin. Perhaps starting with three days after I returned home from Arizona Charlie's. Coughing, lethargic, gloomy. Mostly that can be blamed on the lack of ventilation and the probable 2-pack-per-day-per-customer cigarette habit that sucked every bit of fresh air out of each square inch of the building(s). Maybe it was the years of sealed in despair that permeated throughout. Down-on-their-luck locals coming for the penny slots - surely this will be the day I make up for all the lost years? Yes, there were a few clueless tourists there for the cheap rates and the $3.99 steak/eggs deal, though how anyone could have eaten through the fog of smoke is a mystery to me. \n\nSome horrific details: a broken down pensioner at the poker table, two overflowing ashtrays next to him. A gooey substance above the light switch in my room. More motorized scooters than I care to remember. \n\nOn a positive note, it's been almost a month since I was there and I seem to be disease free. Nothing was stolen and the parking lot was well-lit.\n\nBut, we were there for a middle-school basketball tournament and if anyone thinks that's a healthy environment for young teens, well then let's shoot back in time to 1972.\n\nThe only way I could see myself back there would be if I were to become another person - one with a gambling problem and nowhere else to turn.
4;I have a blast every time I eat at this place. I had NYE there, met a colleague for a business lunch and took my parents for dinner when they were in town.\n\nThe chicken and salmon are fantastic.\n\nWhen you order tea, be sure to inquire whether it's hot or cold. I've seen a few people make this error.\n\nGreat date place.
0;I got the express wash and the car wash broke the antenna. The employees had me fill out a claim and said the manager would contact me in two days to take care of the repair. I never heard back and called and she said I was responsible and I also spoke to the district manager who said the same thing and offered me a $18.99 car wash instead. I have used this car was numerous times in the past for more expensive washes w/ no issue and their response is very disappointing.
2;"Tucked in the wrong place?\n\nMy first thought driving through the residential area was there's something wrong with the directions to this place.  However, to my surprise, it was indeed a \""tucked away\"" restaurant.  My first impression of this place was it was a cute little home with a family room as a waiting room, which I thought was pretty cool. Not a lot of sitting space so I hope you come on a slow day.\n\nWe ordered 3 items, the Brussels Sprouts, Date salad, and the Lamb Meatballs.  The Brussels Sprouts was crispy and tasted of charred vegetables.  Guess it was supposed to be that way but wasn't right for my palate.  The dates salad was definitely my favorite!  It had a hint of sourness from the dressing and sweetness from the dates -- nice and light.  The lamb meatballs were good I thought, but nothing to rave about.  Wasn't gaming like most lambs, but I thought the marinara sauce over powered everything.  \n\nService was good nothing to say here.  The host was kind and attentive. - Enjoy!"
0;"Overly boisterous. Deaf staff. Fillers in the good so there's no flavor. Our hibachi chef was non-Japanese and kept saying how he just learned how to do everything. He basically wanted us to clap every time he cracked an egg. As he left he said,\""gotta make more money\""\nNever going back to this place."
1;Wine list was great, however I would say service was absent.  I figure the food would make up for the service considering other yelp reviews but again was disappointing.  Prices are a bit high for the quality of food, I felt the dishes are a bit amature.  Bruschetta seemed like it was made with toast and pana cotta was comparable to a store bought mix from a box.  If you are looking for old world Itallian food I suggest going else where.
4;Our best meal in Vegas!! Great table side guacamole, and fajitas were amazing! Cant wait for my next trip!
0;"If it was an option not to give any stars this place would get zero. I didn't even get to try the food and will say that I never will. I was meeting my Dad and brother for lunch and was very excited to try this place out. There was a 30 min wait and we had no problem waiting. I waited for 15 mins and my Dad arrived with my autistic little brother. We were about to be seated. My Dad brought my brother is own food which happened to be McDonald's fries and a drink because that's the only thing he will eat. They would not seat us because he had McDonald's. They said it was a health code issue and he had to finish it before we sat down. My Dad clearly stated he was autistic and the only way for us to all enjoy a meal together was if he had his McDonald's. We were going to be paying customers. My brother is very well behaved. So we left and tool our money else where. My mind is blown. We were denied services because my 9 year old Autistic brother had \""special\"" eating habits. What if you have a child with allergies would they to be denied to eat at a family restaurant because they had to bring \""outside\"" food with them so he could eat with the family. Baby food? That's outside food too... I saw lots of babies there that I'm sure had baby food. Horrible costumer service."
2;I came here a few times during their first month, but I haven't been back in awhile since I no longer work next door to the restaurant. I would hesitate on returning after reading some of these reviews indicating that they switched from counter service to table service. The workers there had a hard enough time deciphering the menu and ringing up orders anyways. I'm frightened how they would handle a full service gig.\n\nThere are some good items here, however. I like the first two dishes that I had tried, the eggplant and butternut squash. Both were very unique for this area, and the flavors were great. I really like the kabuli rice too. I liked the small salad bar. I couldn't get enough of their Afghani pico de gallo.\n\nI wasn't as impressed with the appetizers. The samosas and ashak were both too greasy. I didn't like the baklava either, but I'm ruined on that dessert after going to Turkey.
1;"If you're in Vegas and you happen to have the urge to check out the strip clubs, do yourself a favor and skip The Olympic Garden.  Unless you plan on \""strip club hopping\"" and begin at this place, you should head towards one of the surer bets because you will surely be disappointed.  By the way, most of the better clubs offer free rides and entry...not to mention friendlier and more attractive women.\n\nPros:\nLarge facility\nMore than a dozen ladies\nBar\n\nCons:\nLess than a handful were actually \""ok\""\nWorst in terms of friendliness\n\nThroughout the years, I have managed to visit every major Strip Club in Vegas at least once, so I have a pretty fair range of exposure.  Even at the worst clubs, I've been known to kick back a few drinks and tip the women for their effort; however, at the Olympic Club, I literally could not give my cash away.  It was so bad, that I left the club in less than 10 minutes - I downed a beer in 2 minutes, felt completely dumbfounded by the experience, and left.  There were only 3 people that got any of my money: the door person was tipped, the waitress was tipped, and I tipped the only dancer that said anything to me because I've never left a club without contributing to at least one lady's college expenses.  \n\nAfter sitting in the club without a single lady approaching me, I got up to leave.  That's when an older dancer apologized for the slow shift - I gave her a tip for approaching me because it meant that I could leave without feeling too guilty.  There were probably 3 dancers that were ok, but like all the others, they were busy on their phones.  None of them (about a dozen ladies) got up or even smiled, and none of them got any of my \""strip club\"" roll.  \n\nThis review may be a bit skewed because I went in the early evening on a Monday, and perhaps the ladies were simply warming up or needed a couple of more drinks?  The club is pretty dark, the couches were comfortable, and the waitress friendly.  I don't mind being the only paying customer in the club, but this place was just plain awkward.  \n\nI'm not sure if I would go back because there are simply too many options to even risk wasting my time."
0;I was so disappointed with my visit to this store tonight .  \n\nWhen I walked into the store, there were three employees all standing behind the cash registers talking and talking and talking. Only one other customer was in the store. \n\nI was in the store for at least 20 minutes and did not receive a single acknowledgment.  The three employees remained behind the registers. I heard one employee identify herself as Debbie. \n\nTerrible customer service, employees obviously need more training. \n\nI don't plan on returning. I'd rather go to Origins - I've always received fantastic service and friendly employees in their shop.
3;The reviewer who called this the best European bakery got it right.  Amazing breads and baked goods, terrific sandwiches, and European style service - which means brisk and impersonal.  Never rude but never friendly.\n\nThe sfogliatelle is the best in AZ, far surpassing the frozen husks you'll find elsewhere and better that those on offer at Andreoli's (where they don't seem to mind selling burnt goods, and the service is equally 'European').\n\nPrices are a bit higher than mass produced goods, as they should be, but are reasonable for the quailty.  Make a visit, savor the goods, withstand the service.
2;"It wouldn't be October in Matthews without costume-clad sign holders standing on Hwy 74 directing commuters to the Spirit Halloween Store.  From late September through Halloween, retail space in Windsor Square that normally sits dormant the rest of the year turns into a hauntingly ripe playground for all your needs.\n\nAs Chad E. said, the props and decorations they sell range from tame to down-right creepy (this year's demonic children are something else...).  They do try to have novel decor to purchase every year - I can't quite tell if they are catering to what's popular or defining what's going to be popular this year.  As far as costuming needs go, I have been unimpressed the past couple years.  It seems the assortment leaves much to be desired and the prices are steep.  This year, I was in search of something feudal or Renaissance in nature and found no such thing...not even a Robin Hood costume I could modify!  I did find a few things I could use to piece together my chosen costume at Party City, though.  And ladies, your only choices are \""Sexy (insert occupation).\""\n\nAll told, Spirit Halloween Store will remain part of my \""getting in the spirit\"" tradition.  This is my go-to place for porch and party decorations.  Hopefully next year the costume selection will be just as varied."
3;I have been here twice.  Both times for beer and food.  The first time was on a Thursday night and the special was $2 for a fajita taco.  Oh, what a taco it was.  The meat had enormous flavor.  There was onion, bell pepper, and cheese.  There was sour cream and salsa on the side.  Delicious.   And the beer kept coming.  Actually, I didn't really want the beer at the time.  But hey, who am I to refuse what was poured for me.  Besides, it was still happy hour.  The next time I went back I had a coupon for a free pitcher of beer.  So my roommate and I went.  We got a pitcher of Bud Light (a $12 value come to find out) and some food.  He got the fish and chips.  I got the Western Style Philly.  The meat on that sandwich was so good.   I wish there had been more of it.  It taste like the steak I would make at home.  That is a good thing, by the way.  I got my sandwich with coleslaw.  Looking at the fries sitting across from me with a plate of fish I started wishing I had ordered the fries.  The coleslaw was fine.  It seemed to be very fresh.  The fries would have been more filling though.  Eh, live and learn.  Anyhow, the service has been good each time I've been in.  The waitress this last time was joking wih us about how the Shock Top is so damned good the owner wont even serve it. LOL.  I'm starting to like Joey's.  The food, the beer, the service and especially the music.  I love classic rock.
0;So disappointed.  I've had much better in Reno.  The prime rib was tough, the seafood was nothing special  and the desserts were horrible.  Save your money and go to the Buffet at the Bellagio or the Wynn.  Or just walk a few steps and head over to Carnegie Deli.  Don't waste your calories here.
3;DO IT.  Although if I could do it again, I'd rather go at night when everything is lit up.  The only reason we had to go in the day time is because there was a 60 minute wait the night before - even at 11 pm.
1;All downtown casinos are smelly filthy boring small crowded smokey dives not worthy of visiting.  This one is different.  Downtown Las Vegas draws the Walmart types.  This one is nicer, less smelly, more spread out, so you are not fighting with crowds.  If I'm forced to stay downtown, I would stay here.  But here's the problem, you still have to deal with Walmart type people as they are everywhere in downtown Vegas.
2;"this place does what it was designed to do: get you drunk. which is just fine by me. located in a classier strip mall, this place is actually surprisingly large when you walk inside. decked out in the usual \""we are trying to be an irish pub but fail miserably\"" decor, this place has all the guinness and harp signs on the walls that you will ever need. \n\nservice was friendly and fast and the bartendress even drew shamrocks in the foam of the guinnesses with the tap. the music act left much to be desired but the drunk cougars falling on their asses provided much entertainment. i also noted that this place shows EPL games. bonus!"
2;I'm super biased. They play electro house/hip-hop, I mean how better can it get? But for my friends who's into the Top 40 etc, this place WAS NOT THE BUSINESS! \n\nThe place was just too small. No seating. Bathrooms weren't all that big either, the bathrooms in Aria were 10 times better than what they had.\n\nBTW, the dance floor sucked dick. HOWEVER! You did redeem yourselves for such a sick LED wall. Not as good as Voyeur in SD, but I haven't seen anything like that in Vegas ever.\n\nGo here if Electro/House/Trance is your scene, cause it's gonna be a big disappointment if it isn't.
0;My pasta was cold and the server told me I didn't need peccorino on it because I already had ricotta (cold too), I was just trying to improve the taste. \nRaised by Italian parents and grand parents and not to impressed! \n\nService , they don't really seem to care since you may never come back anyway. \n\nInflight food is the same , blend and cold. \n\nAll that for $ 16 a plate \n\nMr Mario Battali needs to try his own food once in a while! \nOr send some spyes :) \n\nNot very Italian.... Just the name :(
4;"This place is amazing. I came here with 4 girlfriends and we all ordered the \""a Perfect Day Spa\"" package which included the oasis facial, body scrub, swedish massage and lunch. It also includes lignt snacks and beverages and use of their steam room, sauna, jacuzzi and swimming pool. I'd never done the spa thing and this was a fabulous first time for me!\n\nYou begin by getting a tour of the place and they set you up with your own locker.  Each of the services that I got were about an hour long so in between them I chilled in the pool, sauna or steam room. They also have a gift shop and gallery of paintings done by one of their estheticians Natalie. \n\nNatalie actually did my facial and it was ahh-mazing. I have super sensitive, acne-prone skin and my face was glowing after she did the pore extracting facial. Felicity did my massage.  She asked me where my problem areas were and so she concentrated mainly on my shoulders and lower back. She worked wonders and put me to sleep. Finally, Sami did my body scrub. This was really great, too. My skin is still super soft. All-in-all our package came out to be $290 before gratuity which after this full day of pampering (we were there from 8:30 to almost 4) seemed like quite the deal. I highly recommend this place and the staff was very friendly which made for an even more pleasant experience."
3;I always make my trip to OfficeMax first before I try anywhere else.  This store is in a great location near 44th St. & Thomas Rd. in Phoenix near the airport.  They have great selections on all the office products.  Binders, papers, markers, and anything and everything you can think of.  They also have great prices as well.  If you need to price-match from Staples, Walmarts, Target, and/or any stores, just bring in their ads and show it to the employees, they will gladly match the prices, sometimes even cheaper too.  Check them out before you go to other places.
2;We checked in late and got two free passes which we had an hour to use before it closed. It was okay. \n\nSurprisingly good: \nOrange chicken\n\nMediocre:\nDolmas, crab cakes
1;Barro's has been our Go-To take-out for years. Last night we got a large cheese and noticed the crust has changed and not for the better. I hope it was a fluke, maybe someone forgot a key ingredient.
3;We came here for my husband's birthday.  The service was attentive and very warm, the Steaks and lobster were perfectly cooked and moderately priced... How can you go wrong?
2;"Yay! Another decent Vietnamese restaurant.  Best part of this one is it's super affordable and open 24 hours!  I will say they are SO busy that sometimes the service can be slow but the prices are great and the food is really decent.  There are some small inconsistencies like - the first time I had the duck it was yummy.  The second time it was \""ok\"" so you kinda gotta be careful of that.  But I always have the crab rangoon and it's delish.  As well as the Singapore noodles, seafood plate and beef pho soup.  I definitely recommend this place especially late at night :)"
4;We ate here last night and I was SO impressed.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but everything from our bottle of wine to our entrees was amazing.  We started with the croquettes for our appetizer and they were delicious.  I got the Study of Hog which is pork served three different ways and I couldn't pick a favorite they were all so good.  My boyfriend got the scallops with salmon pierogies which were also great.  Our server, James was so personable and made the experience even better.  We told him we were celebrating a belated valentines day and gave us our appetizer on the house! We will definitely return here.
3;"This place is great for killing time, a workout, birthday parties, etc.  We enjoy bringing friends and family to FNO when they come into town.  The prices are reasonable as well and they have a frequent jumpers card which gives a discount because you're buying in bulk.  It is especially difficult to get the warehouse cool in the summer, but a \""big ass fan\"" has been installed and makes a huge difference, thank you!\n\nI do agree with one of the reviews about teenagers talking a bit, but I don't really see that much wrong with it as long as they are doing their duties.  \n\nOne suggestion though is during birthday parties, allow the participants of the birthday party to jump for as long as the party goes on.  Maybe this is the case, but we attended a birthday party yesterday and were only allotted an hour to jump when the party was two hours long.  It allows for kids to jump, eat, open presents, and then jump again.  Just a suggestion though.\n\nThank you."
4;My husband and I love Golden Harvest. Their lunch specials are so cheap and they give you a great deal of food. The food is delicious and the staff is very helpful and friendly. We typically order take-out, but have dined in a couple of times and we have been satisfied ordering both ways. When we order take out, the food is ready within 10-15 minutes every time. When you dine in, they give you appetizers while you wait to eat. They have amazing customer service that keeps us coming back time and time again. But most of all, the prices are hard to beat. The amount of food you get in coordination with the prices is the best seller.
3;I thought I would chime in with an update after becoming a regular at this spot. This location now has a person on site to work on the workout equipment and most of the time everything is up and running. A couple of times there has been an issue with the treadmill's audio or channel buttons not working but I can say that it is much improved.\n\nAlso, I have attended one of the boot camps and it was a very good experience. Chris was our instructor and he's quite knowledgable in exercise and nutrition, a great motivator and very personable. I learned a lot and have applied it to my own workouts. I would highly recommend signing up if you're serious about upping getting in shape or taking your workouts to another level.
3;Why are people hating on the Old Navy? Especially Debbie Downer down there. Not everyone can afford name brand hoity toity clothes like yourself AND for your kid? Ok moneybags. ANYWAY- I like this place. They carry a TON of sizes (not everyone is a size 2), they usually have things on sale, and I get a ton of clothing for my 2 year old as well. Old Navy has come a long way since I used to shop here (well, the one in Baltimore) back in high school. The clothing has gotten better- and I have multiple pieces of ON clothing that have help up longer than American Eagle OR the Gap. I'm also glad they downsized the layout- it was too big and bulky before- a smart move by merchandisers. The staff is usually helpful and friendly and they have lots of cute things in stock- the colors are getting better, the selections of styles are getting better. If you want to buy cheap clothes go to the Goodwill and help a sister out. If you want to dress nice but can't afford to shop at Nordstrom (which is for an age group of old) like some people on here- then this is a good place to be.
4;My whole family goes to see Dr. Steve... He is the best chiropractor I have been to.  He actually takes the time to figure out your problem areas and cares about how you feel after the adjustment.  I have a 3 year old and a one year old and they also get adjusted.  It helps so much with their 'moods' and does wonders to keep them healthy.  My kids love Dr. Steve and laugh while they get adjusted and then give high fives for a job well done!
3;First time at this Savers location and I'm already a fan. Great big store with plenty of Summerlin giveaway goodies. The book section, which is my favorite part about treasure hunting, was solid. I found many books I've had on my wishlist here. The clothing section was solid. My friend who was looking for some maternity options, found a handful of things to wear for the rest of her pregnancy. I'll definitely go out of my way to check this Savers out again.
1;Came here with my partner in crime for a quick lunch before we hit the blvd. We've visited the one in Harrah's AC so we were expecting the same long sprawl of fresh, foods on themed stations just like the one we'd been to...Lets say we were highly disappointed. Its small, most foods are low quality, ill prepared (overcooked) and bland or really salty (the small salty pathetic crawfish). Luckily for us we had a Groupon, and it included alcoholic beverages, I would've been really pissed if we were charged the full price. Endless mimosas, champagne and wine helped me make it through without wining and pouting horribly.  I wanna give 1 1/2 stars but that's not possible so its a 2. The service was great, too bad the food wasn't.
3;Camelback rd. has established itself as the avenue for gourmet burgers.  Indian School is laying claim to the hot dog.  Between Nogales, Maui Dogs, the regular visits from Short Leash and now Joeys of Chicago, Indian School is fast becoming the defacto hot dog mecca for locals.\n\nWhile not quite as good as the Sonoran dogs in Tucson or even Mexico, this place more than sufficiently satisfies your cravings.  And the fact that it is cash only and in a shady parking lot only heightens the 'South of the Border' like adventure.
3;"On s'y amuse vraiment bien! L'endroit n'est pas exceptionnel, mais c'est l'ambiance qui fait tout. Je recommande les mardis soirs. Il y a beaucoup de monde et la musique est entrainante. M\u00eame si tu n'as pas envie de danser, tu n'as pas le choix ;)\nPour la petite anecdote, le Caf\u00e9 Campus est n\u00e9 d'un boycott de la caf\u00e9t\u00e9ria de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 par l'Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Etudiante de ce campus."
0;Went here because it was the only pizza place near by open late. Price was average and the food had no flavor. 711's pizza tastes better and is a lot quicker which is pretty sad.
0;Saturday afternoon. nobody in front of us. we gave our order then just sat and waited.... we asked twice to see if anyone was there only to be asked for our order again....then we had to pull over and wait for our food.........15 mins so far and counting...... wow
1;I've been vaping for quite some time so I know what I like, and I know what is out there. SinCity Vapor has a real head shop feel to it with a very empty storefront. Their liquid has alcohol...no bueno. It does have a decent flavor, and a good throat hit. My biggest problem is with their atomizers and clearomizers. Low quality...the worst I've ever experienced. I have given them a few chances but I guess I'll just have to stick to my online shopping and, worst case, a trek across town for my vaping needs.
1;On two separate visits I felt the workers were not very friendly nor helpful. I was pretty much ignored even while standing in front of them. When I asked them questions about selling clothes to them their answers were very vague and they seemed annoyed that they even had to answer any questions. They wouldn't tell how they determined how much to give for what. They wouldn't tell me how long it would take, only that I had to remain in the store or I would be forced to accept whatever offer they gave me. As a busy mom of three I didn't have time to wait around for who knows how long. When I told them I would come back and I picked up the form required to be filled out (I figured I could fill it out at home to save some time) she rudely grabbed it out of my hands without a word. I guess they are trying to save paper or something but she could have had the decency to say so. On my way to pick up my son from school I decided that I would not go back because they just seemed shady, they were rude, and their used clothes are way overpriced. Also it smells really gross in there. It's too bad, I had a lot of really nice things to sell. Better to sell on craigslist or ebay. Since I didn't actually shop/sell there I gave them two stars instead of the one star I think they probably deserve.
4;Had these guys service my transmission on a 64 thunderbird. They were able to get me in quick and had all the parts in stock. Dave was knowledgable and friendly and made me feel very comfortable. The price was better than a few other shops I called. I highly recommend this shop!\nGreat job Dave!!
2;Was psyched in trying out Bobby flay ' s burger joint. At first I was disappointed because they weren't vegetarian friendly. They didn't have veggie burgers in their menu. so I just ended up ordering their griddled cheese and my man tried their original crunchy burger. My griddled cheese had good cheese in it.. but the sandwich was kinda mushy Because of the juice of the tomato which was in b/n the cheese and it tasted salty as well and to top it off the pickle just made it more salty. \n\nAccording to my man his crunchy burger was juicy but it tasted salty too and the chips in between just made it more  saltier.  They must have placed too much salt when they seasoned their burgers as well as the tomato/salsa of my griddled cheese sandwich.\n\nThe service on the other hand was great! I liked how the staff were so attentive. The interior of the place was nice too for a burger joint.\n\nThe price wasn't really worth it though. .
0;Ridiculous. I went to meet up with people. The guys at the top of the stairs let me in because I didn't have cash. My boyfriend found cash and paid anyways for both of us. We went down the stairs to enter the place and our friends walked out. We promptly walked back up the stairs and asked for a refund since we didn't go in the building. The employees collecting fees said no. They were rude and uncaring. I asked for the manager and they laughed. Talk about a rip off. Never going back, never recommending this place, and never saying good things about it.
3;A great burger place. It could use some more consistency with the temperature and size of the fries though. I am not a fan of the new coke machines because they get really crowded when the place is busy.
1;They could use some more healthy options, but they do have a fruit platter, in a pinch its one of the few healthy things you can eat on fremont street. \n\nHowever I go here usually to grab a spam musubi, or a graveyard special. Careful, the spam musubi is thrown into the microwave inside plastic wrap so its super hot when you get it. steam can burn!   \n \nI like their chinese food too but unless you get the combo, its kind of expensive. \n\nfootlong hot dog and coke is a good deal though. and after midnight specials.
1;Went during lunch time. Wait was long to pay, and then another long wait to be seated. Food was average, there are better buffets to choose from if you are willing to pay a couple of extra bucks.  For the price, you get what you pay for.  Waitress was friendly.
0;Caffe Lucano tries its damned hardest to feel Italian - unfortunatly, the over all impression is of a sub-standard coffe house masquarading as a traditional grind house and failing.\n\nI dont mean to sound nasty as soon as I begin, but Caffe Lucano has few redeeming features - it is expensive, uninteresting, not particulary tasty and most annoying (for me at least) the coffee tastes weak and watery.\n\nThe only thing I can think that is a positive is the reduction of the cakes and stuff at 3pm - although by that point the feeling that the cakes are getting a bit past it anyway is over whelming.\n\nIts a shame really, because this place could be so good - it has a prime spot on George IV Bridge  and is large enough to hold a lot of people. Unfortunatly, a whole lot of things would have to be changed to make it worth it.
1;Meh.\nI like the outdoor patio.\nI like the mojitos, and the mojito style lemonade.\n\nService was AWFUL.  We were basically ignored for most of the time.\nI thought the food was meh.\nMeh.  The filet medallions with shrimp and bernaisse wasn't bad... but..... meh.\n\nThe spicy sirloin sandwich with fries... it definitely wasn't spicy, and it too.... eh..... meh.\n\nI'll come back for brunch, to give it another shot.  I *really* want to like this place.
0;"I'm not sure why this place is rated so highly. As a girl I love to go to strip clubs. The interaction is what makes it exciting but all you have here is great pole work and dollar \""bush dives\"". No interaction whatsoever other than having a girl put her thang in your face every time you tip them. Then one of the strippers literally came off stage,  made out with the guy next to me, Then she made out with the stripper on stage. This place is trash."
3;Can't remember how many times I came with my friends. Very good quality of food, fresh, and authentic. Wish the price could be lower..,
1;I was pregnant and my new dr was O'sullivan. It was my first pregnancy so I was so excited.  The staff was nice buti was always waiting 30 mins to an hourafter my scheduled appointment.  Dr. O'sullivan was always very short with me and made me feel dumb for asking questions.  When I gave birth,  she told my family to shut up before my baby entered the world,  which is just plain rude.  Her nurse practitioner was awesome and that's who I saw about 90 percent of my visits.  But the Dr. I'm glad I will never go back to her clinic.
1;I was torn between giving this place a 2 or a 3. Everything was really hyped up beforehand - best buffet in Vegas! Endless crab legs! - but I did not feel like I got my money's worth.\n\nTo start off, after waiting in a long line, we are slapped with the $40 price tag to get into the buffet.  Holy mackerel that is expensive! At this point, I am still convinced that it's totally going to be worth it.  But alas, turns out they have a strictly enforced dress code.  My guy friend, who had chosen to wear a tank top, was told that he could either change his shirt or buy the Wynn Buffet shirt for $20.  After much hesitation, he decided to buy it since we were staying in Excalibur and going back wasn't an option.  \n\nOur spirits dampened, we proceeded inside. The display was impeccable! All the food looked appetizing and there was a huge variety.  The crab legs, however, were pretty tasteless, so don't waste your food space on that.  The rest of the food, while good, wasn't anything to write home about.  Dessert spread was very pretty, but the taste was average.  \n\nIf I were to find myself back here, I would be more careful in choosing dishes to maximize value.  However, I would pick a different buffet despite the fancy names and presentation because the food was only slightly above average.  I would get more satisfaction from going to a cheaper, average tasting buffet but that is just me.
4;I used to come here strictly for the pizookie... It's the most delicious dessert and I can never find the strength to pass it up.\n\nThen I came to realize that their food is equally as amazing as the pizookie.  I don't eat wings, but their sauce is so good, I'd love to buy a bottle of that stuff.  I've been ordering their Veggie Wedgie sandwich or the barbecue pizza when I'm with my cousin.. She adds all kinds of toppings to the pizza and I would recommend ordering a pizza w/ bbq sauce and then whatever else appeals to you.. (Thin crust of course, it's the best PLUS their thick crust usually takes a little less than an hour to make)  I guarantee you'll love it!
1;I used to love this place. My problem with this place is some staff there didn't know what they were doing. One in particular but im not one to drop names. The rest of the staff there are excellent. Maybe today was just a bad day but because of service i received it made me do a review.
2;"The best thing about this place are the bathrooms! No Shit! Er, I mean no kidding!\n\nThe decor in the bathroom is expensive, mimicking a Japanese ancient Castle, with large cuts on stone masonry, copper pots for sinks, and metal tubes to look like large bamboo as the faucets. \n\nThe next best thing is the large stone in the middle of the room. It is a large rock with a spotlight on it, and mimicks a Japanese rock garden.\n\nThe third best thing is the out door patio seating, with the misters going full blast as the tempurature still hovers around 100 at 11:00pm in August. There are several tables out there, and also some couches.\n\nThe 4th best thing is the Pachinko machines in the entryway, brightly lit and real, However, as the cute hostess will tell you, she has no balls (for the pachinko machines, stupid!)\n\nThe 5th best thing is their large drink menu of specialty drinks. I didn't look in there for an \""Orgasm\"" or a \""SloeComfortableScrew Against the Wall\"", or other ridiculous concoctions, etc. \n\nI felt like a Tanqueray and Tonic.  No, Make it two!\n\nThe rest of what they have to offer is, well, meh!"
1;"First of all, if you are a vegan they don't understand what a vegan is. The manager asked me if I wanted to try the horseradish sauce, I asked him if it was vegan and he said \""yeah there's no meat in it\"" I asked him what all was in it and he said, sour cream, horse radish and mayo. I said, oh well thats not vegan then, and he once again said, yeah it is there is no meat in it. I told him that dairy, such as sour cream and mayo is not vegan. He said oh and walked away. They said that their buns and the veggie burger were also vegan, but I would not trust them.\n\nI had the sweet potato fries which were okay. The smell when I was in there was okay, because it is a coal oven it has kind of a different smell. But when I got home I knew there was going to be problems. The smell of the coal oven got on my clothes, skin and hair. It stunk so bad I had to immediately take a shower. Even after taking a shower and sleeping for 8 hours, it still stunk so bad that I had to take another shower right away when I woke up. My clothes stunk so bad that I had to wash them twice. \n\nThe friends that I went with said that their burgers were just okay. The service however was very good. It was their grand opening day so we had alot of people approaching our table asking about the food. It was a little hard to carry on a conversation with everybody interrupting  us, but I understand that it was their first day and they were just eager to see how we liked it. I would never go back just because I dont want that awful smell on me or my clothes again, and the fact that I am a vegan. However the customer service was so good that I will recommend this place to others, with a warning of the smell."
4;Can't ever go wrong. \n\nFast chicken fingers!\n\nFood is always excellent. Always a handful of staff making the somewhat seeming long lines, shorter. Though most are adolescent and teens, looks like they train very well. \n\nI'd frequent if there were more locations :)\n\nCheck out their catering menu too for those events you may throw at home. \n\na bajillion + for SWEET TEA!
3;I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet, while I have 150 stars on my Belly card. Yeah yeah yeah, the stars does hint something. I always have my Taro, with honey, and the bubbles. If not everyday, so it will be every other day, or every week, or anytime I feel like having it. \nMy favorite one is the Taro bubble tea with green tea. I like it. \nI also have successfully persuaded my good friends to have some bubble tea here. Some like it and become a regular, but some hate it. So, yeah, go figure. \n\nThere are times when I feel that it's too pricey. But, well, I like chewing the bubbles and it's just a 5 minute walking from my apartment!\nand sshhhhh, I have way too many pictures of my Taro bubble tea :p
0;Came here with some friends and experienced sub-par food and terrible service. First of all, the food came out really slow for a mid afternoon lunch and hardly any customers. Second, there was a really long hair coiled around a fried dumpling just under the skin and was clearly visible from the outside. I called over the waitress to bring it to her attention and she simply grabbed the plate and left. There was no apology or acknowledgement of the tainted food. We weren't sure if she was going to bring us a new batch or comp the charge so we just ended up waiting for an eternity before she came back.\n\nShe brought three new dumplings, but my group was too disgusted with the food and the service to even look at them. We asked for the check and another lady (I assume a manager) came to speak with us. She asked us if everything was okay and if there were any problems. She made it seem like the hair incident hadn't been brought to her attention so I mentioned that there was a hair in our food. She rudely answered that she already knew this. So...why did you ask us if we had any problems if you already knew about the issue?? Nevertheless, she gave us a thoughtless, mechanical apology and comped us for only one of the two orders of dumplings even though we didn't eat either of the orders.\n\nAll in all, I was extremely disappointed in the way they handled the situation and I will definitely not be back.
1;Looking at Aria I was prepared to be impressed but it was really lacking. I love the decor and style of the hotel. They are really into textures and utilizing a variety of materials and everything is really spacious but it can be kind of confusing to walk around in. The cashier section is not really clearly directed to and I spent 15 minutes wandering before I was able to find it.\n\nThe room is average. Smaller than Palazzo but about the same size as MGM - however our room had a magnificent view since we had a corner room. It took forever to walk there from the elevator but it was worth it to have the view we had. The sofa was a L shaped one but it could fit about 4 and wasn't really comfy- not the best when you have friends relaxing there. It also had two bathrooms which was really nice. Also invite your friends over to try the toilet!!! haha... I know it is funny and might even sound weird but OMG... It is one of those special Japanese high tech ones that has a warmed seat, special jets to cleanse your front AND back, and a dryer to make sure you are nice and clean. I am definitely getting one of these in MY bathroom at home!\n\nThe pool was also really disappointing. We went to Liquid (the 21 and over pool party) and unless you know someone or are getting bottle service, be prepared to pay $50/person. The pool area is also pretty small- bigger than Tao Beach but significantly smaller than Wet Republic and not even comparable to Encore Beach Club. My girls and I got in but there was barely anyone there on a Sunday afternoon so decided to chill at the regular pools. Aria has 3 separate pools and I saw one jacuzzi. The cabanas look like little outhouses or small changing rooms. You can have the privacy you want since there is a curtain that you can enclose your cabana with.\n\nFor all of its style, I prefer staying at Palazzo or Wynn and even though they have a few clubs there I don't think it can compare to XS or the Encore Beach Club
1;"30 bucks is a bit outrageous. Especially when your favorite thing was the grilled zucchini!\n\n  I came here under protest and time constraints as we needed to be at a concert in less than an hour. We headed downstairs to the buffet and I was optimistic with the international variety they offered. The guacamole and sour cream were the only things that looked good at the Mexican bar. The seafood was watery and bland, although I must admit buffalo sauce with fried shrimp is strangely yummy. Nothing really stands out as \""special\"" except the grilled zucchini and yellow squash from the Middle Eastern bar. They were grilled, peppery and cooked to smokey perfection. I went back for seconds and came back with zucchini and a small creme brulee. I should have just stuck with the zucchini..."
3;Yeah for the new Secreto!!  Visited Secreto before the new owners updated the space to a Cantina style restaurant.  We like the more casual vibe...and the green & red chile menu.  A good happy hour M-F until 7, with drink specials (loved my margarita tonight) and $5 appetizers.  The Stack is yummy with chorizo, chicken, beans, and an egg all smothered in green chile.  Tonight we tried the Green Chile Mac & Cheese...we are hooked! Even ordered a 2nd order to take home & have with our leftover Pork Rellano, which was the perfect amount of spicey.  The beans could use a tad more seasoning, but other than that everything was perfect.  Loved the salsa and chips...fresh and yummy.  Kristina, the new owner, came over to our table to check on our experience.  She was friendly & I really appreciated her checking in.  Sounds like they have music Fri, Sat, and Tuesday nights...  We'll be back -- think we'll try Taco Tuesday ($2 taco and Dos XX!  Nice to have this place close by...great atmosphere and food!
4;On my way out of  Las Vegas, I stopped here at the airport location and ordered the Italian sub and it was so delicious and so meaty. I was not disappointed, I wish we had these in Chicago, Thanks
0;Worst car rental experience ever and I'm no beginner to this game. Rate was higher than what i reserved, condition of car assessment missed the biggest damage, and they indicated a full tank of gas but noticed only a half tank in the car after i left the facility. \nDon't waste your time, you will pay more, not less.
1;I love a good burger, I prefer a burger over a steak anyday. Ive had some fantastic burgers in my day, but to me this place is average. Its located inside of Mandalay Bay. Its also pretty expensive, you get charged for everything, tomatoes, sauce whatever. I got the kobe and by husband had buffalo. The service was spotty, I saw the waitress once, she got our order wrong and just brought out what had been forgotten on a plate.\n\nI got the zucchini fries which were average, the cheesecake factory has this place beat by a long shot. The bill for 2 burgers, water, and zucchini fries was $55.
1;"95% of the time CMI is just fine, their maintenance people always respond quickly and genuinely seem like nice people. The maintenance guy even vacuumed my place after an icicle broke my window. \n\nDealing with the main office though, is another story. They always seem to have an attitude of \""why are you bothering me?\"" From the move out procedures to giving my future landlord a referral, everything was a hassle with them and required jumping through hoops. I actually regret recommending them to my friends who were looking for an apartment. \n\nYour options aren't great in Madison but the office staff definitely needs an attitude adjustment."
2;"This is a very cheerful restaurant--bright blue and yellow walls, a saltwater fish tank with all sorts of neat coral, and delicious tropical cocktails.  Try the lemongrass margarita.  A good place to go when it's rainy or you're feeling down.\n\nThere's only one vegetarian entree on the menu (the vegetable curry), but it is quite tasty and the portion is substantial.  The entrees come with their house salad, which is fresh, delicious, and topped with your choice of mango curry, jerk strawberry, passion fruit, or banana poppyseed dressing.  Yum!  \n\nFor appetizers, the fried plaintains, guacamole, and grilled pineapple salsa are all good.  I was less impressed with the watercress and heart of palm salad.  The salad itself was good, but the dressing was nearly intolerably tart.\n\nI docked Jolly Bob's a star because it is cramped, crowded, and can get terribly busy and noisy.  The services is not the greatest.  It can be extremely hard to get the bartender's attention; you practically have to stick a twenty in his face.  Frankly, I don't think their staffing is up to the demand.  There should have been two or three bartenders, but there was only one, and he was helping with tables as well.  The waitstaff should have been doubled and the host should have been sitting at the front of the restaurant, NOT in some corner behind the fish tank. \n\nI recently went during the last week of their Groupon.  We got to the restaurant at 5:45p, weren't seated until 6:30, and had to wait another half hour for our salads.  The drinks came AFTER the salads, and the entrees after that.  We didn't get out of the restaurant until 8:00.  This was on a Monday night!  It's never been quite that bad before, but definitely a place to go early.\n\nNote: They don't take credit cards.  There is an ATM in the restaurant, but it has a $2 fee.  Bring cash.  The drink prices are fairly standard, but the entrees are a bit expensive."
1;2.5 stars\n\nThe fam was in the mood for some brick oven pizza and while I id'd some potential winners downtown, we wanted to stick to somewhere close, so off to the Brixx chain we went. \nWe had the wild mushroom pizza, jerk chicken and vegetable pizzas, and the fire pita with hummus starter. The pita was pretty good I thought, the hummus forgettable. \n\nThe mushroom and jerk chicken pizza were both sans red sauce, and the mushrooms with arugula are always a nice pairing, but I wasn't a fan of the jerk chicken pizza. The veggie pizza was also just pretty average. The dough was  not bad, still a little left to chew on with the thin crust, but I think they overdid it on the cheese, and it wasn't great cheese at that.\nI was tempted to order the tiramisu simply because they said it was made fresh every day, and I am a fan of home-made tiramisu. Sadly, it scored a huge thumbs down, it had none of the fresh airy just-whipped today texture, it was heavy on the rum, disgustingly heavy on the sugar, and the four of us together could not muster up the wits to eat it all. It was a tiramisu gone wrong, a thick, unappealing glob of sickly sweet cream and to top of, a squirting of what I suspect was hershey's chocolate syrup on the plate, and bad chocolate shavings on top. Oh the shame.\n\nSo to summarize, I am still on the quest to find decent pizza in Charlotte and I will not be back here to satisfy the craving.
3;What a great happy hour experience in Vegas! The prices are very fair for both drinks and snacks. We had the red and the white happy hour wines which were quite good and the cheese plate which was very well executed. \n\nThe service was also spot on. There was a full bar and the gentlemen behind the bar (who appeared very experienced) served everyone politely and swiftly. Based on purely on the happy hour, I would definitely go back for dinner.
0;just was trying to find a bite to eat for lunch, they're nearby, so I tried to check out the menu online to order something or at least see what they offer. Menu on their website was not working, so I figured I would try and run over there and take a peek to order something to go. The lady who I spoke to, who was all the way back in the bar as there was no greeter, was pretty rude when I asked about a menu. Let her know I was just wanting to check them out, and her demeanor totally ruined it. Guess I'll just look somewhere else :(
1;"I'm giving this two stars because of the woman (she's not the one who did my nails) made polite conversation with me. The woman who did my nails though was awful. I felt like she was rushing. I got white tips and two of them were not on straight. I asked her to correct them, she eventually kind of did. As she proceeded to \""correct\"" them  she tells me I have crooked fingers which is why the white tips weren't on straight. Even one of the devices touched my skin which kind of burned me. I pulled my hand back as a reaction to the burn and she did not even apologize. At the end of it all my fingers are sore from this woman handling my hands so harshly. Never again."
3;We stopped by for an appetizer and wine and love the place. The bright colors and design elements are reminiscent of Spain. The Chiliwich placemats are a nice touch. We had the tuna cones and each bite was delicious. The avo-cilantro on the bottom of the cone was a fun surprise. \nOur bartender was amiable and  solicitous. We will certainly return to explore the mulitple offerings on the menu. This is how tapas should be, little plates of adventure.
2;Volkswagon corporate called Larry and he refused any help told them his guys would never make errors I asked to speak to you and was told you were too busy
3;I have flown in/out of Vegas several times, this review is for a lay-over so I cant comment on Security. I did play the slot machines (hey I'm in Vegas!!) and did get dinenr to go from PeiWei.
4;Love it here! Staff so friendly
3;Red burro enchilada style with rice and a Diet Coke. Eat it out on the patio with the stray dogs. I love it.
3;"One of the best things about staying at Cosmo, you can go back to your room, change in to some flats and go back down to get some pizza. \nLove this \""secret\"" pizza, long lines, but goes pretty quickly drunk talking in line. Pizza is tasty and fresh, pretty cheap too for being a Vegas restaurant."
0;Not the best place.... Super slow service.
3;We usually end up here for breakfast, and they have always done a good job.  It's a small menu, but there is something for everyone.  If you want a Bloody Mary or mimosa, they can help you out.  If you're in recovery mode, the cafe has some Gatorade and other options.\n\nThe patio is beautiful, and I highly recommend getting a table there unless it's too hot outside.
2;Mi Patio is a solid 3 star restaurant. Some days the food tastes better than others. And some days the entertainment value is better than others. But it's not a chain, it's within walking distance and has very affordable margaritas.\n\nThere's no bike rack (ugh) and the taquitos are basically a carne asada taco with no toppings (which I happen to like).
0;NEVER AGAIN!!!! My daugher had the misfortune of getting her hair cut yesterday by a senior stylist. If that is what a senior stylist is capabable of, I would sincerely be afraid to go to anyone at this salon. She has a full head of long, thick hair and asked for an inch and one half to be trimmed. When she got home, the layers that she were given at the crown of her head were the job of a BUTCHER! Thankfully, hair grows back but not as rapidly as one wishes! It's not just that it is shorter than requested, or that the stylist did not listen, it is more the fact that the stylist has no clue as to cut hair and give a proper hairstyle! My daughter did not check the reviews beforehand but she learned quickly that it is a must. She learned today that Groupon had 4 terrible reviews for this salon! A hard lesson learned! FOREWARNED IS FOREARMED!!!
2;One afternoon my friend and I were looking for a warm drink to heat up on a wet dreicht day.  Seeing that Peter's Yard was complete full and noisy, my friend took me to Looking Glass Books, just behind Peter's Yard.  A lovely quite, chilled coffee come book shop.\n\nThe interior is fresh, floor to ceiling glazing, quirky seats and mono colour bookshelves.  There is a whole Alice and Wonderland vibe about the place.  All in all a nice surprise to find hidden within the metropolis of the Quatermile! \n\nAll sounds so good, so why only 3 stars?  Well, I had the urge for a real chai tea, delighted they had it, I ordered.  They bought the hot drinks to out coffee table and sadly it was just a tea bag chai tea, no creamy sweetness, just a weak chai tea.  I slowly drank it, wishing I had indulged in the hot chocolate my friend was sipping! \n\nWould I go back? Of course, especially to get away from the yummy mummies and screaming kids in Peter's Yard!  I saw they do fair trade there too.  Thumbs up, but alas, still on my conquest to find a real chai tea in Edinburgh!
3;Stopped by for an early lunch. I must have missed the rush. No wait. Chili Cheese Dog came up super quick. Not a bad hot dog. I may have gotten there a bit early. My dog and chili were more on the luke-warm side. Side of fresh cherries were a nice touch.\n\nI wish I brought friends with me. I really wanted to try to the Waffle Ice Cream Sandwich. Next time.
2;"Steak and eggs is a staple of drunk or \""been drinking a bit so now I'm really hungry\"" food in Las Vegas. \n\nWhile there are a few choices in Vegas I always choose Marilyn's Cafe at the Tuscany because its 1. close by to the strip 2. its not crowded, no wait in line 3. it taste OK.\n\nYour steak and eggs is $4.99 from something like 11pm - 5am, consist of a 6ish oz steak, two eggs, hash browns, and toast. Pretty basic, but a core essential in waking up without a hangover. \n\nI've had the other food before on their extensive menu and it gets a pass.\n\nIf you do come here for steak and eggs they no longer allow bill splitting during steak and eggs time so bring CASH."
4;I keep forgetting to rate this place even though we come here a lot. Great service, great food.  I am currently in love with the Joe's scramble, but everything I have tried has been awesome.  What's also great is that if you have a large party they can actually accommodate them here, we just called 30 minutes before and they were fine with us showing up with 12 people.  The Biscuits rewards program is absolutely worth signing up for as well.  We will definitely be coming back here for many years to come.
1;Maybe this restaurant caters to a more Caucasian palate..? It doesn't have the crisp, clean taste that I appreciate at other pho places. (Just making a quick record for myself so I remember that I would have preferred the usual pho place that I go to in Vegas.)
3;Good location if you need to be downtown LA. Service was excellent and rooms were spacious and clean.
2;And if you don't want to spend $2 a margarita, you can spend $1 here!\n\nThere is a Ben and Jerry's inside for non-alcoholic fun,  and cheap t-shirts for souvenirs that aren't too bad looking. Good for gifts for those friends who are third tier or lower!
2;This is a cute little restaurant.  Nice musical ambience but sometimes a little too loud.  Food is good and the combination meals are priced good.
1;I am a member there only because there are no other country clubs close by.  Welcome to Gilbert/ Queen Creek/ San Tan Valley!!! :(
4;This quirky vegan hangout spot is quickly becoming one of my favorite stops in the downtown Phoenix area. The food is super tasty, unpretentious, and the portion sizes are big enough, or in the case of the burro more than big enough, to make sure you aren't going to leave hungry. The baked goods are also quite good and if you're looking for something cool to help beat the AZ heat the smoothies and raw juice are fantastically fresh. A couple side notes: (1) The menu might be a bit difficult to navigate for a first timer, but the helpful and friendly staff should be able to steer you towards whatever you happen to be craving. (2) It's a small kitchen so the food might take a little longer than a typical sandwich shop to come out, but it'll be tasty none-the-less. \n\nIn addition to serving really great vegan fare this place also functions as a local art gallery, theater, and cultural mixing pot. This diversity kind of puts indoor seating at a premium in this small shop, but it also creates a great atmosphere for enjoying more than just a good meal.\n\n*Update 11/2013* \nThe menu has been updated to be a little more new-user friendly. Jackfruit tortas are absolutely delicious. Highly recommend.
4;Wonderful service and great food.
3;We came here because lotus of Siam was packed and couldnt get a sit. We went to Komol as a second option and we were glad we found this place !! The service was awesome, we had the beef panang and the mint chicken and both were great!!! The quantity was great for the price and I will definitely come back!
3;"Good pasta. Good desserts. Good view.\n\nI've eaten at Maggiano's in Princeton, New Jersey and in Atlanta, Georgia. I really wanted to try Las Vegas' Maggiano's. It did not disappoint.\n\nI ordered the chicken fettuccine alfredo, which was delish. The warm, italian bread dipped in seasoned olive oil was finger-licking good; not that I licked my fingers... I had three delicious dishes for the mini dessert sampler: New York style cheesecake (yummy), apple crostada (yummy), and chocolate Zuccotto cake (yummy).\n\nThe price was pretty good. \n\nI dined alone as my friends were napping to recover from the evening's debaucheries. \n\nI will be back!"
2;I really wanted to like this place and I think if I had ordered anything else off of their menu I would have.  Unfortunately I ordered their veggie and it just didn't really work out.  The bread was great and all their veggies were nice and fresh, but the sandwich just needed a little something extra (a second cheese, some seasoning, SOMETHING) just to give it some flavor.  I tried adding salt and pepper but it just wasn't enough.\n\nI'm giving them three stars since the guys working there were really friendly and the bread was good.  If I ever get a chance to come back to Phoenix I'll give one of their meat sandwiches a try.
2;"Upstream, you confuse me. \n\nMy boss took me to Upstream when I flew into Charlotte for the job I'm at right now, so I have a soft spot for this restaurant.  At the time, and several times after that, Upstream was on my top 5 list.  Now, I'm not so sure I want to pay the money for their inconsistencies. \n\nHere are my notes. \n\n1. Bento Box is the way to go because the preparations are always different and feature a nice variety of creative, well executed dishes.  It comes in a wooden 4 square box.  Items like a jasmine rice with shitake mushrooms, lemongrass scented jasmine rice, or seared tuna with sesame seeds and an Asian slaw. Cucumber salad.  The only warning: when the bento is on the menu at night for dinner, there is no price.  ASK THE PRICE FIRST! Don't quote me, but I'm pretty sure my bento one night was pushing $30 if not $40. \n\n2. The salads are nicely composed.  During the fall, there's a yummy bibb and pear salad with dried cherries I adored, and this summer there is this mixed greens with toasted pistachios and blueberries and poppy seed dressing. I HIGHLY recommend getting either salad with the fried oysters.  But here is where consistency starts to slip. I've had salad here probably 5 or 6 times.  Half of those times, the fried oysters have been under fried, and the batter is a bit pale and the oysters feel limp and taste a bit batter-like.  Once the salad was DRENCHED with dressing, so I ask for it on the side. \n\n3. The mussels are OK. They're not particularly plump.  (They're like the one's at George's Brasserie, not very memorable.) \n\n4. Sushi.  I think sushi is best had at a Japanese restaurant, or where sushi is the star. That's all.  Not standout, and a bit too rice-y. \n\n5. The dessert is downright terrible. I know dessert/pastry is a whole other animal, but honestly, if you have a nice a restaurant as Upstream, get a pastry chef to match. (*Totally agree with reviewer Stephanie in that they may not even HAVE a pastry chef.) \n\nMy friends and I had the trio of sorbets/gelato.  They were all icy in consistency and not smooth at all.  The blueberry tart (or I think it was a blueberry tart) featured a HARD crust/shell exterior.  It was bland, and I believe the dough must have been over kneaded.  We brought this to the attention of our server who looked dumbfounded, and answered \""Really?\"".  Yes, really.  I'm willing to bet anyone who tries these desserts wouldn't like them.  As a result, these were taken off our bill. \n\nIn the end, I do think it's a nicely presented restaurant, with very good service for the most part.  If the food can be prepared the same way every time, and the desserts be brought up to a level that matches the upscale food, I'd be more inclined to bring back another 2 stars.  But unfortunately, instead of suggesting it as a place for my friends and I to have dinner, there are plenty of other restaurants we pick first."
4;My favorite restaurant in Vegas.  I'm here 1-2x per week.  It's at a price point that I can afford to eat at on a regular basis and if it weren't across town for me, I'd be here even more.\n\nFavorite Foods:\n\nBeef Satay - The chicken satay is good too, but I'm a beef lover.  It has a slightly sweet flavor goes well as an appetizer or paired with the combination fried rice.\n\nBacon Wrapped Scallops - Bacon. Scallops.  BACON!!!!\n\nBeef Rendang - Its a curried type beef, but what makes it amazing is that it's short rib. Short rib, marinaded and slow cooked with tons of flavor.  Apparently you can order it spicy, but I hate all things spice (I'm convinced spicy things undermine my taste-bud's ability to appreciate beef).\n\nCombination Fried Rice - Chicken, bbq pork, shrimp, egg.  Perfect balance of saltiness with flavors.  \n\nLemongrass Chicken - I believe it's roasted chicken. Lemongrass with a slight sweetness\n\nGarlic Green Beans - Garlic, green beans, butter, garlic.\n\nOn a gluttony day, I order all of the above and make 1.5 meals out of it.
2;Food is great and our waiter was great but food trickled trickled out of the kitchen. If your planning on a quick meal this isn't the place to go.
3;HAPPY HOUR!  Ends at 6:30 I THINK.  \n\nThe prices were better like a couple months ago, but we've gone recently and the prices have changed.  \n\nEven so... I love the 808 Roll:  Spicy soft shell crab or spicy tuna, spicy mayo, eel sauce.  My favorite roll.  I also LOVE LOVE LOVE the Spicy Yellowtail Sashimi.  \n\nSome other favorites:  \nHamachi Kama \nPork Gyoza\nSpicy Pele\n\nThe chefs and servers are young and vibrant... seem to always be having a good time and making conversation with the guests which is always good.  \n\nThe fish is fresh, the service is fast.. and the prices are great!  It's a give or take with this place... sometimes it's busy, sometimes it's not.  We usually try to beat the rush and head over at around 5:30...once we're done ppl are usually coming in.  \n\nWhat's even more perfect??? Coldstone right next door.  Thumbs up.
4;I use Yelp all the time and never felt compelled to write a review before, but had such a great experience at TBS--just have to share!  First of all, even though I'm probably much older than the average client, I was a brazilian-wax virgin ... and freaking nervous to even give it a try.  But, I'm a big girl now and decided this is the time to go for it.  After researching a bunch of places, I selected TBS and Stacey, especially because of the fabulous ratings on Yelp.  Considering the way she would reply to reviewers, I figured she was a classy lady, which is important to me as I'm baring everything intimate to a virtual stranger ... I'm even tentative with my OB-Gyn.  Sure enough, Stacey's a very cool and classy lady and her waxing spa mirrored her class act--it's extremely clean, set up for the customer's privacy and comfort, with a contemporary upbeat and positive vibe.\n\nStacey made me feel comfortable from the start--we chatted like friends who were catching up, despite the exposed position you're in while chatting LOL.  I was in and out of there quickly, yet never felt rushed and her work was so precise.  I took a couple of extra-strength tylenol before going in, nothing else -- and honestly all I felt was a couple of momentary stings.  I had experienced more hurt and inflammation with the old strip style bikini wax, but this hard-wax full brazilian was relatively painless and carefree for me!  Plus, I love that Prince Reigns serum--I had NO redness, no bumps--amazing!  (Yes, Stacey, I know, I don't need to use a lot, just a tiny pump.  See?  I was paying attention to your after-wax instructions.)  Also, just a note: they don't push any products on you, but they sure have some good stuff, nice specials, a 5-day free touch-up (if you need it, I didn't) and extremely reasonable pricing.\n\nMahalo, TBS and Stacey, for being the absolute best!
2;I normally don't like chain restaurants, but I do like eating at the Olive Garden in Greentree.  The food is pretty good here and the service is always excellent.  Although not my first choice, still quite okay.
0;We just took a cycling vacation to Montreal. What a wonderful city. So much to do, so much to see, so much to sample. And, so bike friendly.\n\nWe planned to ride both the Tour la Nuit (a night ride) and the Tour de I'lle (the largest single cycling event in the world- about 30,000 cyclists) and we needed bikes. \n\nSo, we rented a tandem from Ca Roule (which looked good on the website) for the la Nuit tour and rented mountain bikes from My Bicyclette for the I'lle ride.  Our rental choices were planned more for our off-the-bike site seeing itinerary than anything else.\n\nOthers have recommended Ca Roule, but I can't do that. Aside from its location (beautiful Old Montreal) dealing with Ca Roule was a disappointing experience. \n\nFirst, it apparently caters exclusively to tourists (red flag anyone?). Then the tandem we got was poorly maintained (it had a frayed derailleur cable and half way to the hotel, started skipping gears). But we rode la Nuit anyway. The next day, after returning this junker, the 'colleague' who checked us in added an extra fee he explained as an additional 'tax' (of 20%) to our bill. \n\nMy advice? Skip Ca Roule, take the Metro to Lionel-Groulx station, walk a few blocks past Atwater Market, across the blue foot bridge, turn right and rent from Dave (the owner and a biker) at My Bicyclette. Then check out beautiful, friendly Montreal on a GOOD bike.
1;A hit and a miss. We went here looking at the reviews and were disappointed. Don't get me wrong, if you're new to Indian food (like many reviewers here seem to be) you'll probably like it. Unfortunately for Samosa Fake-tory, we've had our share of good Indian food and Samosa Factory isn't it.\n\nFirst off, to the uninitiated, samosas look and taste nothing like the one's you find here. I mean, not even close! Google samosas and you will see what they look like. After our samosas, we ordered the thalis (sort of an Indian mixed plate) and the naan (fluffy, delicious Indian bread) was great. I didn't like the saag (mustard leaf) but my SO did. Neither of us liked the chicken curry or the potatoes and cauliflower. Contrary to popular claim, the rice wasn't basmati. You can't ever go wrong with mango lassi (mango flavored yogurt drink) and that probably was the best part of our meal. In summary, our food was okay but the alien samosa was a massive FAIL. If you've never had a samosa please do yourself a favor and grab one from an authentic Indian restaurant. You will not regret it.\n\nMay I recommend Gandhi's on Paradise Road or Tamba on the strip for the most authentic and best Indian food in town?\n\nPositives - The service was good. Our server, who I think is also the owner, seemed like a genuinely nice guy.
4;Love love love Postinos. It is such a great atmosphere and I'm a huge fan of the rasp chicken salad. \n\nWill be back again and again!
2;The resort itself is nice, but I get the feeling that the casino part of the hotel used to be part of something else and the hotel was built around it. The casino gave off an older feel to it with the typically bad Vegas style carpeting and that cigarette stank that you could smell from all the way out in the lobby which is a good distance from where the casino is located on the property. \n\nThe website raves about the 50 acres of lush gardens...but they are across the street as part of the TPC golf course. Additionally, the website claims that the hotel is smoke free. That would be great if the casino wasn't located IN THE HOTEL. The ventilation system must have been on the fritz because the smoke smell was noticable the moment you came in the door and went from present to waking me from a dead sleep choking on Sunday morning because it was so bad in our room. Ugh. Major disappointment. :( \n\nThe food at the resort was alright. Like I said previously, the casino part of the hotel gave off an older feel and the restaurants located near the casino had that same run down type of feel which just didn't fit in well with the attempts to make the rest of the resort have an upscale feel to it. \n\nOur suite was nice though we didn't get the turndown service we had requested the first night. \n\nAll in all, 3 stars is pretty generous and I'd say that it was because the spa was so nice that I'd keep it at the 3 stars. I've stayed in some amazing places all over the world and at best, this stay was just average.
2;I was a little disappointed with our O experience.  We spent a lot of money buying 8 front row seats and walked out a little less than thrilled.  The show opened with the usual cirque characters teasing the audience.  It included a huge water pour from the ceiling and completely soaked my brother and his fiance.  They were wet an cold for the entire show and weren't offered a towel.\n\nI'm used to the death defying acts of cirque shows but this seemed more like glorified synchronized swimming.  Yes, the theater, costumes, and music were beautiful and some of the acrobatics were truly impressive, but it wasn't as great as I thought it would be.  I've been more impressed with other cirque shows.\n\nI also didn't understand the story.  Was there a story?  There were certain main characters, but I wasn't sure how it all tied together.
0;"This place was horrible to me and my group! \n\nThis was the first time I ever had to pay to get into a club/bar/lounge! \nWe were told it would be $20 for ladies and $30 for guy for an open bar, but it's only on well drinks... the cheap stuff that will give anyone a massive hangover! It was a Friday night and this place felt like a junior high dance in the 80's!\n\nThe promoter for this place was following us as we were walking to Haze and told us that they were no longer allowing anyone into haze because they reached their max. My group bought into the promoter's scam because they heard open bar so we got our wrist bands and went in line. \n\nThe Bouncer was absolutely rude to us! We were all dress to go clubbing so we were dressed nice, no baggy clothes, no tennis shoes, the three guys that was with me were fitted. The bouncer asked for our ID and when I gave him mine he just stared at it then at me then he shined his flash light right in my face! We were in a well lite area, there was no need for a  bright LED flashlight to be in my face! Then he asked me to give him my full name. then he asked for my street address, then asked me what was my zip code then asked me that city I lived in, what year I graduated high school and THEN asked for my credit card. Finally I was allowed in. What made me mad was that my guys were actually patted down! \n\nWhen we went in to finally get out drinks, we were distracted by the horrible DJ that was playing music that belonged at a low funded family reunion! The songs that were playing were more like karaoke songs then songs you can dance to! I paid to get in, so I tried my hardest to enjoy myself.\n\nSo when we got to the the bar, our bartender was rude! We asked for a Long Island and she said that the \""open bar\"" was only for well drink and left us. She didn't even wait for us to order anything and there was only one other person at the bar and another bar tender was helping them. So finally after 10 minutes, the horrible bar tender came back and we asked for a round of vodka and cranberry and my friend asked for a long island which he paid $12 for. The drinks were weak and took a while for the bar tender to make. The long island tasted like water as well as the cranberry and vodka. I was so disappointed and angry that when my boyfriend went to tip her $4 for our four drinks, I asked him why he was paying that much for water and left the bartender with a $1 tip JUST to be nice. \n\nWhen we went to the dance floor, my friend who paid for his drink noticed everyone in there were middle aged Caucasians! Was it a coincidence or were we being discriminated? I didn't see anyone else being patted down and I didn't see anyone else being questioned! \n\nAfter being in there for 30 minutes, we could no longer stand the horrible music that DJ was playing or the horrible service we were getting from the bouncers and the bartenders! I am never going here again and I would never recommend this place unless I want that person to have a horrible time and spend unnecessary money!"
2;Pho was good and the service as well.   Was not overly impressed, but will try again.
4;Good food and great service.  They have a tasty salad and a good beer selection.  The pizzas are fantastic.  I have tried each appetizer and enjoyed them all.
4;Great neighborhood place to eat sushi! Their albacore nigiri is a must have. Service is good too.
0;UGH! had the worst experience trying to get our room at this hotel. i was checking in on a Sunday, around 2pm, trying to see if our room was available,  when the man (not quite) helping us told us rooms were ready, but we would have to pay a $40 early check in fee, or wait until 3 pm, to get our room sans fee.\n\nOk, I have never paid a fee to check in early- esp by an hour! at any hotel. this seems unheard of ,but fine,  we'll wait and hang out with some friends in the casino.  \n\nSo at around 3pm, we come back, see if we could get our room - and we are told no, rooms arent ready- theyll call us within 40 minutes for our room key. An hour goes by- no call. we go back to check in at 4 PM, and NOPE theyre still cleaning the room. \n\nIt wouldnt be so bad if we didnt see the crowds of other hotel guests being given key cards and directions to their room. but seriously? \n\nSo by 5 PM, we're pretty fed up. Our room was not ready. We need to get ready for dinner! It wouldnt have been so bad if the staff we dealt with were apologetic or even showed any sympathy for our situation \n\nWe finally were able to get our room by 5:30pm. We thought the worst part had been over, but as we walked in, the room was unlike the other rooms we had previously stayed in at Caesars. The bathroom had no door, the room seemed cramped, I'm pretty sure it was a wheelchair accessible handicap room- but not in a good way. It's almost as if they saved this sh*tty room for us. It was in stark contrast to Cosmopolitan where we'd stayed the night before. I almost wanted to go running back to Cosmo, where the staff have ALWAYS been accommodating.\n\n4 unsuccessful check in attempts, one sh*tty room later, i'm never ever staying here again. Zero stars..
4;Two Gals rules.  I remember many, many a trip to Boulder City as a child, mainly for Art in the Park and other events, and we would always stop at Two Gals for breakfast or lunch and it was always, and still is, one of my favorite things about going to Boulder.\n\nThe old-fashioned feel of it is quaint and homey, and everything there is just so fresh and actually cooked just for you.  The wait staff is friendly and the whole thing has such a small-town charm about it.\n\nAnd the food is always amazing.  Their breakfasts are big and hearty, their quiches are basically gourmet and are pretty well known.  For lunch, they have sandwiches to tempt and sate any appetite along with other selections. \n\nDo yourself a favor the next time you go to Boulder:  Skip the A&W.  They have those in Vegas now.  Try Two Gals.  You'll thank me later.
0;ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING\n\nToo bad I cannot give this less than one star.  I remember a much better eating experience a year ago before a flight and now I wonder if they were using the same stock of food from a year ago!\n\nService was awful.  We didn't even get our sodas until about 15 minutes after ordering them.  I ordered the chips+salsa and the veggie tacos.  I think they dump the chips in the trash and serve the bag cut up to look like chips instead.  No flavor, no salt, stale - come on at least heat them up to fool me!  The salsa is 'charred tomato' and it was cold as ice with once again no flavor.  I take that back, it did taste like the inside of a can of tomatoes.\n\nThe server said the veggie tacos come with a side of rice and black beans.   What I did not realize was that the taco 'shells' themselves were silver dollar flat cold 'patties' that looked like someone took instant grits and formed pancakes.  The veggies appeared to be pulled out of someone else's order and it was apparent they dont clean their grill.  \n\nOh and lets not forget the scoop of mush they called rice.  Those black beans, well yes there were some - exactly 9.  Yes, nine whole black beans on TOP of my rice.  This left a huge empty space on my plate which was instead occupied by a small plastic container of more ice cold salsa.   I was begging for salt, pepper, dust, sand - anything to add some flavor to the meal that tasted like crushed ice made from dirty water.\n\nDO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!
0;"As an Arizona native I was excited to try the Phoenix location on central; as I had already tried the Mesa location and was a bit underwhelmed. I was hoping that the Phoenix location would impress me and live up to the rumors I had heard.  The server was fast and reasonable polite, and after ordering two combo platters (beef burro and chicken burror) the food was out in under ten minutes.  This was surprising, as I expected a longer wait do to the self proclamation of all food made to order.  Unfortunately, this was the last pleasant experience here.  \n      I would like to claim that the food was just ok, but in truth it was pretty awful. The chicken was dry and had a slightly rotten taste to it as if it been sitting around for a few days.  the beans were undercooked, crunchy in fact.  The rice was okay but it seems very dry and tasteless, even after dumping half of the salsa on top of it.  My father's beef burro faired none better as he referred to it as \""mushed up cat food\"". \n      As an active man of large stature (6'4 240lbs), it is rare for me to leave a meal unfinished, but in this instance, I found myself abandoning the plate and retreating hungry and unhappy.  If this was a bargain priced restaurant I would be more understanding, but for 12 dollars I expect more than boiled chicken, undercooked beans, and tasteless rice.  Oh, and they unknowingly charge you $1 per small chip bowl which you find on your bill when you pay....for shame!  Save your time and visit one of the many glorious Mexican restaurants in the area, just not here.  But if you do, worry not on seeing me as I shall never return!"
2;Best thing about Rotelli's... FREE GARLIC KNOTS!!\n\nThose things are thebomb.com! I could east baskets full of them!\n\nI would probably give Rotelli's more stars if they had more exciting vegetarian dishes. They definitely have a handful of veggie friendly options, but mostly boring. I usually go with the Sausage and Gorgonzola Penne, without the sausage.... OR a calzone. \n\nFood comes out fairly quick here and quality is really great. Never any complaints about the quality.\n\nThe seating here is limited, but I do like that they have mostly booths (my favorite seating option = cozy). But then again Rotelli's is in a strip mall, so I guess you can't expect it to be too big.\n\nI usually come here for work when I'm babysitting kids and we're going out for dinner. Rotelli's is definitely kids friendly!
4;We had an event catered last night by Postino for a group of 30.  \n\nThe event was a fabulous success.  The food was terrific.  The service, both during the planning process and delivery was excellent.  \n\nIf you've never catered food before, please, for your own sanity, consider Postino.  They have an easy menu.  It's affordable.  They're easy to work with.  They also offer discounts for non-profits.\n\nWe will be using them for many events in the future.\n\nThank you Postino!
2;Just had a nice tall frosty cocktail and awesome mini corn dogs and mozzarella sticks!!  Yummy!!
1;I thought the Good Egg was mediocre.  I got a veggie omelet with brie.  The brie was really thin and sparse and the veggies were definitely not fresh.  Also, my plate came with the toast on it and it still had empty space.  If I'm paying money for a meal, I want my plate to be full.  \n\nService was fine.  They kept my coffee and water cup full throughout the meal.  But, unfortunately the best service would not make up for the poor quality ingredients.
1;Don't schedule online, call them because their website reliability is garbage.
4;I love this place! Small, intimate area, almost feels like I'm in japan, eating yummy ramen! Gotta have it with cold sake! Delish!
2;edinburgh is a city blessed with many beautiful scenic areas from parks to extinct volcanos to beaches.  portobello beach is one of those lovely scenic areas that has a mix of victorian granduer and slightly run down modern day arcade parks and play parks.  the mix of these two sort of leaves me with rather mixed feelings about the whole area.\n\ni do like portobello beach.  it has a lovely wide promenade that is great for cycling or running along.  but there are also a number of rather run down looking chip shops and a sad looking arcade and a few play parks that have seen better days.  then there is also the newer cafes that are clearly trying to reinvirgorate portobello's original grandeur.  \n\non those few rare warm and sunny days the beach is packed with families in swim suits building sandcastles and even attempting to swim in the freezing cold water!  the promenade is packed with people with ice creams and cold drinks.  it's a great vibe but i'm not convinced it's my sort of vibe.  so portobello beach is a-ok and a place i will continue to use for cycling or runs, but maybe not somewhere i'll frequent on a sunny day.
4;"I absolutely love this place. We accidentally discovered it nestled in the strip mall when we moved to Gilbert last year. I felt like I was walking into one of those corner deli restaurants back in Upstate New York. The staff is incredibly friendly and the owner \""Sal\"" introduced himself while I waited at the bar having a Moretti Draft Beer. He's a really friendly guy and offered my wife and 7 year old some garlicky baked dough knots while we waited. What was even cooler was that he gave us a package of free home made sugary doughnuts when we left. WOW! This place rocks!\n\nThe food is fantastic and made fresh.  Our favorite is the large pizza (be sure and try their sausage) and wing combination to-go and it's an on-going special for like $20. Can't beat that."
1;2.5 stars for the novelty of it - the food could have been a lot better.  The carnitas were decent (but dry) and the chicken fried rice was ok, very salty though.  The refried beans tasted like they were out of the can. I liked the chile relleno with the saltine coating, it was pretty good. Emerald chicken was bland. The BBQ pork was tasty and the jerk chicken had some nice spice - but jerk chicken isn't Chinese or Mexican?  I was confused.\n\nThe restaurant is in a creepy converted warehouse.  I felt like a horn was going to go off signaling the end of my break to go back to work. The guy at the counter was patient in explaining how to order and such, but otherwise they weren't the friendliest at the counter.  The free cookies at the end are pretty good.
0;"This company's contract is very frustrating to work with. I signed a 60 month (5Year) contract and in their fine print, if you don't notify them within 90 days of the end of the 60 month contract, they automatically re-sign you for another 60 months.  I have used them for 8 years but they still want more money out of me.  I pay $71.28 for a cassette tape player. I can not speak directly with my sales rep, at least she is willing to send me an email. I did get her name from someone on the 800 number I was directed to call if I had questions about the \""nominal rate increase\""...again. I am still working on canceling service."
4;All three of my kids has been coming here starting with my daughter at 18 months\nand now she's in kindergarten and still goes when she's on break. Mrs. Brandi and her staff are very nice and will treat you and your kids with respect. She has renovated the center twice since and it looks better and better every time. It's clean I never seen any bugs or rats. I have even seen all of the staff clean every night before they leave. One thing I really loved is the fact that even though I'm so busy with work and school they actually prepared my daughter for kindergarten she actually got into the school she's in because Watch Me Grow is accredited and so they actually teach your kids. I am also seeing the same improvements with my son that is about to be two, which is also another plus for me because, I know that the staff is teaching the kids knowledge and not just taking it as being a daycare but also a learning environment.
3;this was a nice place, the pedicure was excellent.  $35 for a manicure/pedicure. \n\nwill go back again when I'm in town.
1;"After much consideration, I decided my previous rating unfairly portrayed Vinery. That 3-star rating was heavily influenced by ambiance and vision, two very important aspects of a restaurant. When applied to the food, not just the space in which the food is served. I'm not giving up on Vinery, but rather challenging them to rise above the mediocrity that was apparent in our meal. Trust me, I will be back. And when Vinery has developed its standing in the downtown foodie destination guide I'll be proud of how far it's come along. Until then...\n====================================================\n\nSuch a difficult place to review, because I see so much potential. It's a great location, tucked into an awesome neighborhood. The interior is intimate and has some great cosmetic touches. I like the idea of having the kitchen behind the counter, so you are right there in the action. Service is good, without the annoying hovering, and isn't rushed so this lends itself nicely to a slow meal to enjoy as much as possible. The complimentary sangria is pretty good (however, Dottsy's Slap me Silly Sangria has lifted the bar rather high). And offering a four-course Monday night meal for $10 is brilliant in any economic situation. Plus, they have a tapas menu. \n\nAnd now, the ubiquitous \""but.\"" \n\nBut: Egg rolls shouldn't collapse on themselves from over frying. The slaw was good, but the egg roll could have been removed from the fryer several minutes earlier. \n\nBut: English cucumbers are one of my favorites, however they don't have such a long shelf live. Mixed with vine-ripened tomatoes is a great idea; however, bringing some zing with feta cheese and a light sprinkling fresh dill and a splash of balsamic would really bring this salad to life. Perhaps I'm partial to the hummus I make and Crazy Jim's pita bread, so I'll leave it at that... \n\nBut: Skirt steak should never be used for anything other than fajitas, cooked fast and hard. This is not a good cut of meat to have wrapped around a starch. Possibly fresh asparagus...but, leave it in the fajita mix. The rice was entirely too over-seasoned, even for a saltaholic like me. \n\nBut: Merchant Services can be just as much your friend as your enemy. Americans use credit cards for $1 purchases, so certainly we would use them for dining out. Not having a working CC machine puts your customers in a very awkward situation. Granted, there is relatively close access to ATMs and even the Circle K. But, if you have to send your customers away to pay for their meal, are you really accomplishing much? \n\nThere's a reason I front loaded this review with everything but the actual food--this is the part of the puzzle that keeps Vinery 214 Bistro from launching into space and being a stellar dining attraction. Ideally, this is a two-star restaurant, with the emphasis being on potential ability. For now, I've decided 2.5 stars is generous, and rounded that up to three. I'll be back, trust me. But I'm hoping that the menu is reevaluated, tweaked, reinvested and solidly delivered in this beautifully packaged restaurant."
0;"Stayed in this hotel last minute through a hotel-booking website. The hotel was in the middle of renovations; all of the amenities and aesthetics were pleasing to the eye. \n\nHowever upon entering into our room for the first time after checking in plenty of hours before, it was like a scene from Inception; Leonardo Dicaprio discovering his dismantled hotel room in bewilderment. Apparently the housekeeping department forgot to clean up the room.\n\nWe tried not to sweat it. So we called the front desk to have someone come and bring new linens. Given that it was 2am, the guy said someone will be there in 15 to help us. We gave them 20-30 minutes then so we decided to call housekeeping directly. \n\nInstead of ripping someone a new a**hole at 2am, I decided to share my review.\n\nI gave them 1 star for the nice lady that came and helped change the sheets and pillow cases for us, as well as providing plenty of towels/complimentary soap. \n\nThe most they did was give a sincere apology during our check-out. \n\nIt seems like a hit or miss. It's too bad that happened because I believe we would have considered returning. Hash-House breakfast made up for it."
0;Update 1 1/2 years later. Both tires I bought from these guys blew out on the road after developing bubbles in them. I am writing this from a tire shop in El Centro waiting for a tire. Thanks Discount Tire
0;I went to get my eyebrows waxed at about about 1 pm today. The trend for this particular establishment is to rush to get the eyebrow job done which always puzzles me as I'm usually the only person in the shop, so it's not like they're losing money if they spend an extra minute taking their time. Last time one of my brows was shorter than the other. No biggie, I just penciled it in and no one noticed. This time, however, will be the last time I frequent this store. \n\nI went in to get my brows waxed. The woman took me into the back and did the most slapdash, haphazard wax job I've ever had.  She waxed only the bottom half of my eyebrows. I had to point out the extra hair on the top sides of my eyebrows and then she wiped off the goop and tried again. The part that completely ruined the salon for me was when she got wax in my hair. I felt her attempting to get it out without me being aware. It wasn't until I heard the scissors snip off my hair that I went from irritated to furious. She actually CUT OFF MY HAIR!  My wedding is in less than three months and she snipped off a good bit of hair attempting to hide her blunder. My hair is quite long and it'll be quite noticeable to any hair dresser worth their salt. \n\nThen, she had the audacity to ask if I wanted to add a tip. Here's a tip: learn how to professionally wax eyebrows before wasting a customer's time and money.
4;Delicious. Anything else I add to this review would just be fluff. Delicious and reasonably priced sums it up. No inside seating, basically fast food and there are tables outside in the foot court common area. We ate there pretty late so it was cool with a breeze. Dress accordingly.
3;Don't really eat Mexican food out much.  Usually prefer the homemade stuff.  In Vegas though I don't get much of that either so I decided to venture and try this place based on the great reviews.  We tried the chicken enchiladas with green sauce, mini-molletes, and a quesadilla arabe.  I got the chipotle sauce from the quesadilla on the side, just in case.  It wasn't too spicy but had delicious smoky flavor.  If you're a bit shy with spicy food, ask them to try the sauce before you order, they're happy to comply.  Great place, and I will most definitely be back!
3;The blue cheese burger was amazing. Still craving it 2 days later. No appetizer is needed as the portions are huge.  Go with the onion rings over the fries and be sure to save some room for the pudding shakes. \n\nGreat waitstaff, prompt, courteous and all the recommendations were spot on.
2;"Never clicked on \""update\"" so, along with you I'll find out how this works...\n\nWent back for lunch over Thanksgiving.  The crab bisque was really good.  I'm not one to rave about a simple sandwich but their tuna salad w/bacon, cheddar, on buttered wheat toast was pretty darn great.  \n\nSince \""Yelp Stars\"" mean different things to different reviewers, here's how I justified the upgrade to 3 stars:  The food is pretty darn good and consistent and deserving of 4 stars.  I just think it's too pricey for where and what it is...a neighborhood restaurant/bar, and that gets them 2 stars.  So overall a 3."
0;I agree with the only review other then this one, when it comes to the pharmacy staff, no problems at all. The person I dealt with was very personable.\n\nHowever,\nI will never be shopping at this location again.\nI went in to get a few last minute items for a trip and had some trouble finding a couple of things so I looked for help with no luck.\n\nNo associate was wearing a distinct uniform, which didn't help to begin with but Anytime an associate WAS around, they would greet and acknowledge the other customers making sure they were finding everything okay then walk right past me as if I wasn't there. \nOne associate doing that is already intolerable but this happened with three different associates, INCLUDING the store Manager, Donna.\n\nNot a happy camper and extremely frustrated, I finally had to wait in line at the pharmacy to get some direct attention.\n\nAt check out, I asked the cashier what the store managers name and she replied with 'why'. Although I felt that it was none of her business and that was an extremely unprofessional response I told her I had a poor customer service experience. She THEN told me that she would call the manager over and I could speak with her. \nI didn't want to speak with her, I wanted to know her name since I was pretty positive she was one of the workers I wanted to complain about.\nI explained to the cashier the poor customer service I received mentioning when associates were around they would offer help to other customers.\n\nAs im sliding my card the cashier says 'no that's not right, we don't have poor customer service here.'\n\nUsually im one to bite my tongue but I just could not resist. I looked at her and said 'excuse me? did you just tell me no that's not what happened?'\n\nShe then started going on about how everyone was busy, I asked why they offered help to everyone else shopping. Her response was 'well maybe you looked independent and they thought you didn't need help.'\n\nis this lady for real?\n\nI then said associates walked right past me and she said 'well they need to go to the back to stock shelves.'\n\nlady,\nI don't give a crap. Having been working in the customer service / retail business myself for years, I know what is expected of associates.\n\nthe cashier CONTINUED to defend the staff until I finally interrupted her and said you know what, I don't want to give you my business. I don't want any of this product. She looked at me and replied 'ok, you can go now.'\n\nWithout even making it home,\nI called the store and spoke with a Male manager (obviously not Donna) and explained the situation too. He seemed very lost and didn't seem like he understood how pissed off I was so after his reply of 'ill talk to donna about it.' I asked if there was a corporate number to call and complain too.\n\nThat was probably the only professional person working for the walgreens corporation that I spoke with that day. The lady asked specific details of the situation and made me feel like she was really concerned with the fact that this location gave such poor customer service. I received a case number and was told the Store Manager would contact me within a couple days, which she did.\n\nI refuse to give this walgreens any kind of business and cannot BELIEVE how unprofessional the cashier was.\n\nThe problem went from a complaint about maybe talking to associates about proper customer service, to talk to your cashier about the fact that arguing with and calling customers liars is extremely inappropriate.\n\nI think her name was b? not sure, she had an accent and I didn't bother to look at her name tag when I was there.
0;I called this place to set up an appointment, the guy was so rude it almost shocked me. I have never been this insulted by just one sentence. Instead of listening to my request for the timings of the service , this person spoke to me as if I was wasting his time by calling him, I would like to give MINUS 5 stars If I could here. Please do not call this place!  Do yourself a favor and call a reputed company for your cleaning needs.  Am sure there are many other places who would treat you well and give you a good service.
0;Horrible place. We ordered the ribs and chicken tender with garden salad and home fries. The garden salad has rotten leaves. I just cannot believe it. The ribs are tasteless. I feel like eating cardboard. I would not recommend this place to anyone
1;"We went during their Sunday brunch which turned out to be $20/person. For just $5 more, you could go to the famous World Carnival Buffet at the Rio Casino which offers WAY, WAY, WAY more.\n\nThe food here was just \""meh.\"" Nothing special and nothing out of the ordinary. For the price, I thought they would offer more but they don't. I guess the interior decor makes up for it. The Red Rock is a really nice casino - but their buffet just didn't really do it.\n\nWe only came here because we didn't want to drive - and we wanted to try something new. Next time, we'll stick to something we know."
4;Cute little free museum in the heart of Scottsdale! The staff are super friendly and knowledgeable!  I could spend a whole day chatting with them! You must walk through if you are in town!
4;Five Star Food!!! -hidden under Esplanade Theater the chips & salsa will blow your mind and are a fabulous way to prepare you for what's about to hit your pallet when your order arrives!!! -ITS A MUST DO!
3;I'm more than a little wary of cheap ny-style pizza.  I've made my way through a few different Lawrenceville spots and mostly felt pretty underwhelmed.  Greasy and boring seemed to be the trend, but I was very surprised by how I just couldn't stop eating the large cheese we got from Supreme Pizza!  I think it's the crust, super tasty, chewy, delicious.  I'm looking forward to going back.
0;The first time I went to Ground Control, the service wasn't the best, the baristas (sp) weren't very welcoming and the breakfast food wasn't very good either. I decided to give it another chance, and l have no future plans to go back. Stay far away from the chicken salad as we found an unwelcome visitor mixed in with ours. So unless you like to eat bug sandwiches I'd steer clear from this place.
2;I want to get to where I'm going, but I think I hate airports!  Although I didn't have any issues, by the time we landed, and had to walk it seemed like 2 miles, take off our shoes, and go through all the crap again, it was time to get on the plane to LV.  I just got off 1 plan, why did I have to go through all that again!  Uggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh!  lol
3;Table was ready for 4 and a baby. I've been here for dinner and drinks but never been here for Sunday brunch so decided to give it a try. Actually the original intention was to find chocolate banana pancakes from the day before but noticed it was only a brunch for Sunday- not Saturday. Looking at the menu the first item that caught my eye was the chilaquiles for $10. I've had it at a different restaurant and had to try it for comparison purposes. It was quite unique in that the tortillas was cut up strips and fried. Some were covered in Oaxaca cheese and cotija  cheese and red pepper coulis with some shredded green chili pulled pork hidden here and there and a sunny side up egg on top and some sauce. Not too bad. It could have had a little more sauce for the extra fried tortillas and a little bit more pulled pork. Others ordered the Bear Republic (chicken breast sandwich with avocado, lettuce, tomato, and bacon with a side of dill mustard like potato salad) for $12.50, and the Picadinho (diced NY strip steak, peas, rum sauce, Brazilian rice, 2 eggs made how you like and a side of seasonal fruit) for $16. A list of cocktails are also available like sangria and mimosa. Cool place for brunch.
3;What can I say?  I've been in Chipotle stores from AZ to UT to FL.  Same great food and experience.
0;this place is really not good at all, probably one of the worst all you can eat sushi restaurants that I have been to. Really not worth the price for what you are getting, not to mention that they don't even include any type of dessert on the menu or even green tea. Way too many extra charges and small bland portions.\n\nI won't be returning
2;We chose to go to The Buffet at Bellagio because we STAYED at Bellagio. The selection of food is not wide. They said they have SEAFOOD but I couldn't seem to find my favorite SASHIMI anywhere! (Maybe b/c I was there for lunch?) But their spicy tuna handroll was quiet good. Steak, sirloin, lamb, Irish smoked salmon, and bow-tie pasta w/ tomatos were all I can recall. FYI, I just want to point out that eating buffet is not really good for you - do the research on google, bro!
1;Basic Burger patty was frozen (medium well was gray and hot, but still squishy. Know what I mean?).  Stopped in between flights at 7pm. Fries were cold. Come on, guys!!  I'll gladly pay, especially when trapped in an airport, an extra buck for hot fries. Throw them out, for Pete's sake, when they time out!  But the beer was good (can't mess that up) and the view against the window of ground ops at C6 is worth it!  So go, but pay for the premium patty.
0;Swarnjit Singh is a joke.  The guy does not give answers, doesn't have time for question, is in to much of a hurry (most likely to make money).  I'm totally confused what condition I have and what medication is for what.  I have to google my condition, just pathetic.
1;Visited here for lunch today. I had been to the Bar Louie's in Kansas City previously so I felt comfortable enough to know what to expect and didn't felt compelled to check Yelp reviews before arriving. Had I done so, I wouldn't have looked completely confused upon entering since there was no hostess stand or the typical 'Seat Yourself' sign. I found a bartender finally who confirmed you could sit anywhere and picked a seat inside but along the windows to still see outside. The patio seemed nice but not enough umbrella's to shade the tables at the 1pm sun and the atmosphere inside seemed more like a sports bar with the TV's around the bar than the one I visited before. No big deal, just different.\n\nMy waitress arrived several minutes later and provided menus while I was waiting for the other person in my party to join. I was in the mood for salad and was excited to see all the varieties of salad options. I ordered an ice tea and eventually the orange brie salad with the $4 upcharge for chicken at the recommendation of the waitress. \n\nWhen my salad arrived, I was a little stunned. For $12, you usually get twice as much chicken and at least 30% more of a salad and other ingredients. As one of the other reviews stated, even my blackberries were cut in half and I got a total of TWO blackberries. Really?!?! In addition, I'd say there was about half an orange and maybe 5 small to medium chunks of brie. Not what I was expecting for a full salad that was expected to be my meal. This was just slightly larger than a dinner salad.  I will say that it did take me longer to eat than expected and I felt full when I left. Unfortunately though, 2 hours later I was hungry again. What a waste of $12. The ice tea was descent though but $19 for a small salad and ice tea is WAY overpriced. I could do better at McDonalds for a same sized salad and drink for $5.\n\nDon't plan on returning.
0;Zero Stars. Zeeeee-ro.\n\nLogged on today to pay my bill and find its gone up $7 just for internet. Happy New Year, from the cable company.
1;"The videos were awesome. When I sat down \""Smoking in the Boys Room\"" was on. Not one of my favorite Crue songs. But then it started a run of all of my favorite Crue songs in a row, including Corabi's \""Hooligan's Holiday\"" (which I'm surprised they run) and the criminally underrated \""Hell on High Heels\"". \n\nThat was amazing! \n\nBut that's about where it stops. The place was pretty dead. Although in fairness to them, it was 5 p.m. on a busy holiday weekend (conference championship games),so it's not like anybody was in Vegas. Yes, I'm being facetious about that. I was actually kind of bummed it wasn't more happening. \n\nI also went back there for late-night happy hour after the Rock Vault show. Why and the heck is this place not next to the theater where the Rock Vault show plays? Talk about poor planning. I mean, Rock Vault, Vince Neil. What am I missing here? \n\nInstead it's tucked down a long hall way. Which might be for the best. Because the food isn't great. I have suspicion it's just Smart and Final boxed Mexican food being served. Although, that might be mean to Smart and Final. \n\nI really wanted to love this place. I'm coming back for the Guns 'n Rose show in June and my friend really wants to go here. But I don't know if I can allow that. Which breaks my heart."
1;VISIT\nTuesday dinner service, main dining room\n\nFOOD\nOn par with other NNY locations. Not great, but not bad. Although, my 7yo made a point to compliment the server on how much she liked the pretzel rolls on her sliders.\n\nSERVICE\nFriendly, but PAINFULLY slow. We sat for about 15 minutes before anybody greeted us or took our drink order. I felt abandoned many times. I had to sit there and stare at my salad (once I finally got it) for a while before they brought silverware. It took about 20 minutes between the time I said we were done and the time I got the bill, after reminding her once in-between. What should have been a 1 hour visit, easily turned into 2.\n\nDECOR\nIn a word: depressing. I felt like I was sitting in my great grandmother's barn. It's just one, big, drab, loud, bright, dingy room. There were a couple pictures of New York on the wall, and some TVs. Otherwise, we might as well have been sitting in an elementary school cafeteria.\n\nI will probably never go again -- not with the number of other great choices in the area.
3;Oh good, I'm a regular at a donut shop. I'm a pair of sweat pants, a NASCAR Snuggie and 11 cats away from spinsterhood.\n\nAnyway, these are some pretty awesome donuts. If you're looking for doughnuts, you can take your extra consonants and vowel somewhere else, my friend. If you bring these to work, you may get a raise.\n\nApple fritters, cake donuts, glazed, jelly-filled... good stuff. But get there early because they're only open until 3pm during the week and on Saturday and 2pm on Sundays. Some weekdays, they are closed a bit earlier than 3pm (as I have had the misfortune of learning first hand).
0;"Many airports these days are attempting to become more upscale; there are sculptures and musicians and art and fancy food. In theory this is great! If I'm going to pay more for buying food in an airport, I might as well be paying for something good, right? Problem is, when it goes wrong, I just feel cheated. They should know better!\n\nTake Humble Pie. Theoretically a gourmet pizza joint in the Phoenix airport, the pizza they gave me was one of the worst I've had in YEARS. The crust was soggy, the toppings spartan, the sauce sickly-sweet and the greasiness unbearable. When I first picked up a slice, all the toppings promptly fell off. I tried to put the toppings back on, but the greasiness of the pizza left me to eat it two-handed: first a bite of the crust, then a bite of the toppings.\n\nReally, even if this place billed itself as a super-cheap pizza joint I'd feel cheated."
3;Yummy! Nice variety. Good quality. \n\nIf you're jonesing for a burger and your friends want salads or something, yup - they got 'em. Doing the gourmet burger schtick but that's ok if you got the goods. They do. \n\nGreat sides. Nice bar. Terrific service.  Would go again in a heartbeat.
2;Lovely, rich food, adorable atmosphere, spotty service and prices that are about a third more than they should be.  If you're trying to wow a date, or just have drinks, this is a great place.  For dinner, for the money, you might be able to do better.\n\nI've been to two parties here, and it looks really impressive.  The atmosphere alone is worth the trip for a special date night.  \n\nI've tasted/ordered many of the dishes.  They were all delicious and well made, rich but not too heavy and in perfect portions.  However, the dishes are quite pricey, and, in my opinion, not quite remarkable enough to merit it.  I think there are plenty of fine restaurants that charge a little less and wow a little more.  \n\nThe service is, well, odd.  The hostesses and bar tenders seem nice.  However, I noticed that asking even simple questions sent the servers back to the kitchen to check - when I was a server, that was pretty rare, and they had almost the same menu many months apart, so constant changes weren't to blame.  The first time, the server was nice.  The second time, the lady was just bordering on rude, and bizzarely insistent that the salad I ordered contained no avocado (even though the menu expressly listed it).  In a place that charges so much, I would have expected polite, knowledgable staff.
0;"Not impressed. My coworker and I were waiting for a movie across the street and decided to try and beat the heat by getting some ice cream. I have allergies to soy so I have to be very careful about what I eat as it is in *everything* these days. There were two gentlemen in the store one dark haired and kinda sullen looking,  the other heavy set. I failed to get their names as I was quickly put out by our experience and just wanted to leave. \nThe heavy set guy was busy with a customer so we asked the dark haired one if there was nutritional information available and politely explained I had allergies and had to be aware of everything I eat. He looked at us blankly and kind of put out sounding responded \""I have it in a book.\"" There was a pause as he just stood there staring like we were some sort of circus oddity. Finally, my coworker politely asked if we could see the book. Without saying anything and with a slight roll of his eyes he turned, grabbed the book and shoved it in my face kinda rudely. I took it from him and turned away from him because it was clear he had some sort of problem. I remarked to my coworker \""Friendly... Love that\"" because he clearly was not.\nPerhaps he despised his low paying job. Perhaps he thought we looked too low class to be in his presence. Perhaps he was having a bad day. Perhaps he was just a jerk. Whatever the case, his unfriendliness and and our unwelcome  were palpable. I flipped absentely through the book but quickly decided I really had a problem giving money to a store who had employees that seemed to think openly treating customers with disrespect was okay . Handing the book back to the employee in question, I smiled and said thank you as we left. As if this wasn't enough, as we were leaving I noted that he never took his eyes off of us and even kind of elbowed his co worker and started making some sort of comment while staring us down through the window of the store as we left. They chuckled amongst themselves if full view of us as I watched. They seemed not to care that I could see their every move. \nWhen I called back after we left and asked to speak to a manager, at first I was put on hold while whoever answered said they would go get the manager. A couple seconds later, the same person came back and said, \""Oh I'm sorry. She's not here.\"" He then informed me he had no idea when she would be back in. \nCall me crazy, but I find it hard to believe in a store of that size one could be unaware their manager was no longer in the store and further could not give me any sort of estimation of when she was expected except to say she was \""usually\"" around in the morning. \nAt any rate, I have scarcely been treated so rudely in a customer service environment ever. So, to the manager, whoever you may be, I would suggest you inform your employee he should endeavor to adjust his attitude towards paying customers if he intends to continue working with the public. Honestly, I really don't care what his problem was. Not my issue. I couldn't care any less what he thought of me or my coworker. However, I steadfastly refuse to give my hard earned money to a store which allows this kind of blatantly unacceptable behavior from one of its employees. Next time, I'll just find a Ben and Jerry's or simply endure the heat without aid."
1;People must come here for the owners or the pizza, because what we experienced last night was just mediocre.\n\nThe penne in cream sauce was just plain. Presentation was bleah. Caesar was okay. Chicken was dry and there was a bit too much dressing.\n\nIf you want romantic and quaint, this isn't it. Think pizza joint with slightly better decorations.\n\nI would say if you're in the area, go to VinciTorio's. We seemed to be the only non-regulars, so I must be missing something. Probably will not return.
1;This place was great when it was called Mark Rich's NY Pizza.  The new place has gone way downhill.  I used to love their pizza, but now it's way below average.  I used to drive miles out of my way to eat here, but no more.  It's just not the same.  The staff changed and I guess they changed cooks.
0;These guys were horrible! I brought my vehicle in for a brand new transmission. It took them three weeks to finish! After returning to me my vehicle it still had transmission problems, and I had to bring in my vehicle again with the new transmission. This took another week and a bunch of phone calls to get ahold of them. I was very displeased with the service as it took forever and I had to bring it in again after they put in the new transmission. The WORST part was a ONE YEAR LATER their new transmission had problems again and was COMPLETELY JUNKED. I took it to the dealership to be done the right way. It cost me thousands and it was only good for a year till it had to be replaced. WHAT A JOKE. I write this review to warn others that I got completly screwed at this AAMCO location.
2;A nice small casual place north of the Las Vegas strip. It is located on a weird corner street and parking is limited. The menu is in both English and Spanish and price are reasonably affordable as compared to restaurants on the strip. The air circulation could improved. It was a bit muggy inside but satisfying enough to be away for the Las Vegas heat.\n\nThere was a good variety of food available so narrowing can be tough. I've ordered the chicken arepa while my brother ordered the beef arepa. I recommend the beef over the chicken. Personally, I believe there's more flavor between the two. The outside of the arepa is a bit oily so be careful not to remove the wrapping. I made the mistake of removing it and it broke into pieces.\n\nBy the way, they charge 50 cents for a cup of water as indicated on the sign. What kind of place does this for tap water? This is a disaster recipe for BYOH2O.
0;Horrible rooms. Front desk takes over an hour to get checked in. Not worth it with all the properties in Vegas.
0;I've had better pizza in airports.  The sauce is too sweet and crust not crisp enough.  Pass!
4;The best bagels in the valley all start here.  And who doesn't love a bagel?  But this Chompie's isn't just about the bagels.  This is one of the best places for breakfast in the valley. Corned beef hash, potato pancakes, chicken fried steak, and of course eggs served either traditionally w/ bacon to done w/ lox and onions served w/ a bagel.  I was surprised how good their pancakes were, but I realized I shouldn't be since they are a bakery and all.  Silly rabbit.  \n\nHmmmm... strange concept.. Jewish deli for lunch..?  Rocks.  Super duper rocks.  Their reuben has been good to me.  And their patty melt is so freaking good.  Messy to the point you need extra napkins and maybe a spare shirt, but super good.  \n\nThey also have an amazing selection of other desserts and baked goods.  I've never been disappointed.  And for you East coast transplants, you can also pick up some of your old East coast yummies here - say a bag of Wise potato chips? Certainly made some of my peeps happy.  \n\nA great spot for a surprisingly good meal, or just a dozen bagels for the office.
0;Tried to enjoy a dinner out with my kids and within ten minutes of sitting down, the dining room was turned into a football league sign up station.  Not kidding.  Totally unprofessional for this to go on when people are trying to dine.
4;Stopped in on a random Wednesday afternoon. Wanted to try to quiche because of all the recommendations in these reviews but at 1:30 they were already out, must be good then! I decided to try the blue Brie grilled sandwich with a iced dirty chai latte with almond milk. I love that they give you lots of milk choices here! Everything was delicious and the customer service was on point. I will come back later and try the quiche!
1;"Good prices, nice decor, tasteless food.  I only ate here once, traveling from California.  Got the fresh spring rolls and Moarn Chha Kyei (vegetables in a \""spicy\"" ginger sauce).  The spring rolls were OK, but nothing to rave about.  The ginger dish was the blandest concoction I've ever had in a SE Asian restaurant.  I mean, there wasn't a hint of spice or heat, and there was only the faintest trace of ginger!\n\nI am hesitant to hazard a guess as to how a well reviewed Cambodian/Thai restaurant can serve such bland fare; maybe folks around Pittsburgh don't \""do\"" spice.  Maybe my palette has been spoiled in the Bay Area by real Thai cuisine.  Whatever the reason, I can't recommend this place based on the one meal I had there."
2;Located in the old Mont-Royal Arena, the best part is that there is underground parking off of St-Urbain. The store is fine. I've seen them throwing away food at night and it's a shame, it should be donated to a homeless shelter. But other than that, it's easy enough to find what you want and go.
4;"My wife and I ordered a new washer and dryer from Queen City and everything went as smoothly as possible. The sales rep, Mike Coscarelli, was real easy-going and not in-your-face and the units were delivered to our ordered and delivered to our home within a week. \n\nDelivery and set-up went smoothly, too; the delivery crew was on-time, professional, and set up our new washer and dryer quickly. They even discovered we had ordered parts we didn't need and made a note on our receipt to get a refund.\n\nWe like to support local businesses, and it's nice when the quality of service is as good as or better than the big chains. Queen City didn't disappoint!"
3;This place has a nice lunch special. You get soup, salad and a three selection combination plate for about $13. I chose the teriyaki beef, combination tempura and California rolls. I couldn't finish my plate. The service was good and the atmosphere was fine for lunch.
1;Cons:\n- Complete dump\n- Cockroach motel\n- Insanely hot with the A/C units blasting into the non-existent hallways (you walk outdoors to get to your room)\n- Very confusing venue to find your room\n- Room is small and dirty\n- Bathroom has stains\n\nPros: \n- BEST LOCATION on the strip for the price\n- Right across from Caesar's Palace\n- Relatively Cheap\n\nOverall: If you're going with fraternity boys, this place is the best location to stay for the price. Do NOT go here if you're trying to impress your loved one or with your spouse. It will be an absolute disaster.
0;Bland food and warm beer.
4;A blast! You should do the Bootleg Canyon experience first and then you get a $10 discount coupon for this one. Obviously this one is much shorter but still a blast to do it. And if you can time it right with the light show it's even better! A must do!!
2;"Rose has been the place that me and the girls from the office go for a pedicure every month. It's been a fun ritual and I've been enjoying the pedicures. I think the best way I can describe/review this place is to do a pros/cons list.\n\nPros\n- 20 dollar Spa Pedicure\n- Usually not too busy during early lunchtimes or mid-afternoons. They get real busy at lunch and from 330 onwards\n- Family-owned business so that's always nice\n- They sanitize their instruments in some sort of UV warming thing\n- The nail technicians are good at what they do. The best of them all is the older gentleman who works there. He takes time massaging your feet and legs and has even been able to deal with one of my co-worker's ingrown toenail effectively\n\nCons\n- They could have more colors of nail polish. They have a passable selection but it's definitely lacking. I don't see some of the OPI colors I like in this selection\n- The older gentleman is amazing (as mentioned above) but the other nail technicians just don't measure up. I was there yesterday for a pedicure and got one of the other women technicians. She worked really fast on my pedicure (the man was massaging and working on the woman who was seated next to me and I was so jealous as he took a longer time and she seemed like she was in bliss). The woman working on me decided to hurry on my pedicure since there was a crowd of people coming in. \n\nAll in all, this place is nice enough and reasonable. I'd give it a 4.5 star if the man was doing my pedicure all the time but since it's seldom that I'm lucky like that, I end up with the \""not-so-dedicated\"" technicians so it's probably a 3 star experience."
4;Eat it. Maybe. Skip it.\n\nEAT IT! Def.in.ite.ly.\n\nAs a current resident in Seattle, I lived in the Henderson / Las Vegas area for 4 years. Firefly was my all time favorite place for drinks and tapas in LV. A great place to grab some food and drinks after work and/or to take my guests from that visited me from out of town.\n\nThe staff was very friendly. The food was plentyful. The drinks were endless.\nThe pitchers of passion fruit mojitos and the white wine sangria are the best thing to ever drink under the shade, alfresco, to beat that warm Las Vegas day heat, trust me. They are 10 out of 10 of the best refreshing drinks in the 702.... and the better yet, the best tapas I've had too date.\n\nMy only mediocre critique: Firefly used to be a diamond in the rough. A locals paradise. But now I heard that sometimes it gets so busy that you have to make reservations... sad but also great for their business. I highly recommend this place to locals and visitors alike! This place will make you love the LV foodie seen and want to come back for more.
0;We were told that the wait was only 15-20 minutes and we ended up waiting for 45 minutes!!! We were all just waiting there while others that just arrived passed us by. I finally decided to complain and that's when they finally put their heads together and set-up a table for us. Worst place for a Sunday Brunch! Food was ok...not worth the wait.
0;This used to be my go to place. Unfortunately, times have changed. There are a very select few that do a good job, but the majority of them are lazy and rush you. \n\n\nToday when I went, the girl who did my nails had to be physically woken up from a chair she was sleeping in. She came over, didn't say anything. I told her I didn't want them cut. Next thing I know one is cut super short. Then I told her to stop. But she insisted they be even and kept cutting. So now I have short stubby nails. Then comes the paint job. She gets it everywhere! I have her clean it up and there still are spots on the edges of my fingers. She doesn't bother to even file the ends of my nails. Next thing I know, she is getting up and moving to give someone a pedicure. I go up to the front and say I guess I need to pay, and they look at me like I'm crazy. They go over to the girl and I finally get to pay. \n\nI have been a loyal customer here for over 4 years. I was able to look past a few things in the past, but today was the final straw. Unfortunately they have lost myself, as well as any of my girl friends that ask where to go.
4;OMG. I was not expecting much when I came to Rose Rabbit Lie, just your standard club that is less hyped up than the others.\n\nBut there were STILL shows going on when we came in about 12. And it was super impressive stuff. I loved being entertained while enjoying cocktails. \n\nThere were tons of interesting people and crazy performers. \n\nMy only complaint is that our promoter was wrong when she claimed it was open bar for girls from 11:30-1:30. We only got one drink ticket we could use, and that's it. Lame.\n\nBut the place otherwise was great!
0;We went there with the expectation of seeing girls swinging from the rafters. No girls swinging from rafters, and after looking up, I didn't really  see any rafters, maybe the lighting. What I did see was a lot of men, biker types, not my scene. It was a Friday and pretty busy, but just too loud to even have a conversation. Finally we saw two girls that were waitresses, dressed normal, but still no chicks swinging from rafters. So after about a half hour of this, we left.
4;It's about time for Goodyear, AZ. to get a restaurant which scores high marks across the board!  My experience is now three visits deep and have traversed multiple levels of the restaurant and can truly offer it  5 star rating!  Believe it people, this place is the ticket!\n\nMy review is based on three separate visits offering a greater insight to their operations and a broader picture of what they are capable of doing.  Formerly McGrath's Seafood house, there has not been an overwhelming amount of a makeover needed to get the place up and running.  Great for Paul Fratella and Anthony Guerriero who are the brains behind the operation! \n\nOur first trip was last week for Sunday dinner.  We arrived during their initial happy hour which is from 2-7 daily and decided to dine off of the discounted menu since it was so appealing looking.  \n\nWe started off with a glass of their house Chardonnay and a Caballeros Cocktail, their version of the famous Hurricane.  The wine was surprisingly good and for only $3, it was the deal of the day.  The Caballeros was smooth and refreshing, reminding me of being back in Key West having cocktails at Mallory Square at sundow.  Too many of these and I would have had to take a cab home!   We snacked on a Cheese Burger & fries, a Fish Sandwich as well as some chips and dips.  Their pricing is quite low for all that was offered and filling to boot.  \n\nOur server was delightful and a real treat.  She was quite busy that might yet barely missed a beat when it came to her attentiveness.  She seemed knowledgeable about most of the foods items and was able to make suggestions along the way.  \n\nFollowing the meal, the manager offered us a tour of their facilities sharing the company vision and we were most impressed.  \n\nBased on this experience, my co workers decided to try out the incredible deals on lunch items.  The specials are all $5 and the variety is enough to keep us coming back.  Turkey Club sandwiches, Fish Sandwiches, Cesar Salad and Beer Battered fish along with some Baked Potato Soup.  We called it in and it was ready when we arrived.  They must are seemingly still new at getting their to-go orders together as there were some items missed.  Nothing that we could not live without, but things like plastic-ware, condiments and napkins. All in all it was still a well packaged lot and everyone at the office enjoyed it thoroughly!\n\nThis morning we round out visit #3 for their Sunday Brunch.  It runs from 9-2 and believe me, you will not go away hungry!  We were graciously greeted at the door and seated immediately.  Our server was Sarah and was bright and welcoming from the very moment we arrived.  She told us about the Mimosa & Bloody Mary Bar which was $2 a glass so we started out with a nice Mimosa.  Sadly the OJ tasted a bit like frozen, but it was still delicious.  Sarah invited us to begin with the buffet when ever we were ready.  Once were received our drinks, it was off to the feast.  \n\nThe primary food line has an expansive array of breakfast items to chose from.  Perfectly poached eggs topped the Eggs Benedict.  There were Scrambled Eggs, Home Fries, Plump Sausage links, Crisp Bacon as well as Biscuits and Gravy.  There was also a wonderful Macaroni and Cheese, Chicken Paella, a Waffle station and Carving station with a huge slab of roasted pork.  Across the aisle was an Omelet station where the selection of ingredients was seemingly endless.  The Omelet Chef was friendly and working two pans at a time so the wait was limited. \n\nFrom there, our next trip took us through the restaurant to the seafood station which included Peel and eat shrimp, mussels and Snow Crab Clusters.  There was cocktail sauce as well as fresh lemons, all of it very inviting.  In front of that set up was the Mimosa and Bloody Mary Bar.  You have got to do the Bloody Mary's!!  The supplies to complete the perfect drink are all there!  Worcestershire sauce, Horse Radish, Gigantic Olives and a huge supply of all different hot sauces!  Well done!!\n\nThe last station visited was the dessert table.  It included fresh fruits, pastries, breads and muffins.  There was a fresh baked apple pie, amaretto Cheese Cake and a creamy & delicious Chocolate tart served in a aperitif glass that was to die for!  The morning was a huge success and this, by the way, was only their 2nd Brunch event!  \n\nImpressive?  Yes!  Room for improvement?  Always.  Nothing is flawless from the get-go.  Would I recommend this place?  ABSOLUTELY!  Adults $20, Kids 12 and under $8.  Don't miss out on this!\n\nEnjoy!!
1;"What can I say about this walmart location. This one seems to have taken a turn for the worse. I havent been here in a while but atleast 5 years ago this Walmart was a fairly well maintained and well stocked location. Well times change and this one seems to have taken a turn for \""K-mart\"" if you catch my drift. The aisles are a bit disheveled and many items are not adequately stocked (went in for 5 items, came out with 3 - blasphemy). I didn't spend long in here, but from the looks of things i'll probably just go to a Target or Super Walmart next time."
3;"in reply to the last review from dawyn who panned the place...maybe you did get a bad cut of meat; it happens even in a place like Del Friscos where 99.999% of the time the steaks are fantastic. But I'm suspect of your review and opinion in that you're complaining about it taking an hour for a party of TWELVE to sit down, order, eat and pay....about the only place a party this large could accomplish this is at a McDonalds or a cafeteria...c'mon, this is an unrealistically picky point to write about, which makes me think the steak maybe wasn't THAT bad"
0;There are far far better places to stay. The rooms have or have had bed bugs as you can tell by inspecting the sheets. Dirty rooms and shady guests. The lobby door is locked until the front desk buzzes you in, but that doesn't matter because the rest of the building is unlocked. Pay the extra 5 bucks to stay at Premier Inn right down the street.
2;Decent food. Too expensive. Small portions.Average service
4;Came in on a Saturday with two hours until an event and was in need of a dress shirt. Neil greeted me right away, measured me accurately and with a bit of discussion on my fit and style preferences he had several great selections laid out for me. I was very impressed with the fit, quality and selection of the clothing and ended up buying a second shirt just because. I will be back as frequently as I can as I loved the amazing service and knowledgable staff. Thanks for taking great care of me, see you soon!
2;"Typically I give a place that falls in the middle of great and bad multiple chances.  For whatever reason it's easier for me to 1, 4 or 5 star a place after the first visit, rather than 3.  As far as yelp is concerned, 3 stars isn't a bad thing - \""A-OK.\""!\n\nThe scene is strange.  It's a mix of typical Arcadia, Scottsdale and the like.  This place is more of a sports bar than anything, in my eyes, with better food than your typical sports bar fare.  Seriously.  There's like 14 televisions in here.\n\nService is quick-ish.  Food is fresh.  The servings are very large.  Some things waver on decent-to-bland, while other things are pretty swell.  The mac & cheese is a pass, in my opinion, and not worth the $5 (for the small cup you get - ah, contradictory to my large servings note!).  Some dishes have an overpowering taste, while other leave you wondering if you're eating food or chewing crunchy water (that sounds gross now that I've typed it out!).\n\nBeer and liquor list is pretty typical; nothing to note really.  A few changes here and there and I could see it as a really decent spot.  The same could be said for the food, really.\n\nI'll be back, yet again, The Garage just hasn't blown me away yet.  Also, on a funnier note: \""Garage\"" reads easily as \""Garbage\"" on the menu, which was kind of comical."
3;"I got props again from my boss for suggesting we eat here at Burrito's Juarez.  I was reading a review my cousin wrote on a Mexican restaurant and made me want to eat their food.  However, it was way too far from where I was at and didn't feel like driving all that way.  Luckily I found this location that was much closer.\n\nWe ordered two Fish (Tilapia) Tacos each, and shared Tortilla Chips with pico degallo and ordered guacamole.  How did my boss describe their fish tacos?  \""like California Fish Taco's\""  and supposedly by her standards, California makes the best fish tacos.  I did agree that the fish tacos were awesome.  The combination between the crunch of the fish and cabbage, to the soft tortilla married well.  They're huge and two was more than enough for each person.  \n\nAs for the Tortilla Chips, they were different and crunchier than most places I've had them from.  Their pico degallo were the best I've had and the guacamole, well that was just mushed avocado.  I'm used to having it with onions, a little tomato, and jalapeno.  But it was still good.\n\nTonight, I decided to eat there again and tried their Chico's Tacos.  This is a Taquito drenched in their red spicy sauce.  It wasn't too spicy.  It had enough kick to it.  If you wanted it hotter, they provide you with the hot sauce to add to it.  I didn't need it. It was perfect the way it was.\n\nI'm definitely coming back because I really want to try the corn concoction.  I think it's called Elcote.  I'm not sure.  I'll probably have to come back to this review and make corrections."
2;I'm a barbecue nut and always seek out the local joints wherever I go.  I figured I'm coming to NC and since I love NC style cue I'd have a great time.   Unfortunately in an area that is full of good cue - this was only okay.   I wished I had gone elsewhere as soon as my Brunswick Stew came out.  It was thin and waterly with very little flavor.   I have eaten BStew all over the south and this was in the bottom 5 that I've had.   I also had the pulled pork and it was only passable.    \nThe atmosphere was fine and obviously caters to the young after work crowd which is fine.  They had live music in the form of a guitar player.  That was enjoyable and the beer selection was good.   I just wish the cue was better.  If it was then this place would be a hit.  \nWould I return - no.
2;Service was below average. Wait staff seemed to get every table's order mixed up with another when serving food. \n\nRandom items ended up on our bill. Thankfully the removed it once I said something.\n\nCustom made a burger and Mac N' Cheese. Half of what I ordered was missing.\n\nIn all, it was a slightly below average burger joint.
3;Well, I suppose I will be echoing the majority of Yelpers on here when I say that I really love Fez and in my approximately dozen times eating lunch, dinner, or happy hour there, have not had a bad experience. \n\nLast night three of us headed to Fez after a day by the pool. It was around 8PM and the place was still hopping. We were seated quickly and our server was very prompt and friendly. \n\nWe started with the hummus as always- which is one of my favorite appetizers, along with the lettuce wraps. (In fact, my mom only orders lettuce wraps when we come here) \n\nI had the Rosemary chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries, and it was delicious as well. I think Fez probably has the best sweet potato fries in town. \n\nOverall, I think Fez is a great example of how downtown Phoenix could be.
1;Rushed service ruined what could of been a great night out. The view of the Belagio fountains is unsurpassed. Food was tasty and flvors blened well. But the serivce. They were burning them and turning them. I guess that what happens when there are lines out the door there?
3;"The Park Terrace theaters are no fancy theaters by any means.  In fact, they show their age, and I wouldn't normally choose Park over other theaters.  Thankfully, the theater has wisely recently converted to showing mostly independent films that the Manor Theatre can't carry due to its size of only two theaters.  This allows Charlotte to have even more independent films playing at any one time -- yea!  Kudos to Park Terrace and Regal Entertainment (who bought them from Consolidated Theaters)!  Plus, Park Terrace has stadium seating, which the Manor doesn't.  I do love that they've kept the original sign and look to the outside of the theater.  It gives it a retro feel.  Now, if they could just amp up the \""classy\"" aspect inside the old building, we'd have a Class A independent film theater."
1;Good service. Mediocre food, even at happy hour prices. Honey chicken wings the best of the HH menu.
2;"I debated, 3 or 4 stars, but went with 3 for now until I try it again. The lunch buffet was fairly interesting and a great way to try various foods, including the sushi. Get there early for the buffet as it got crowded at noon. I got there quite early and was a disappointed in the temperature of the food; it already seemed to be getting cold."
0;Although I have been using yelp for many years, this is my first review. My husband and I went to Mert's on Sunday morning around 1015. It was not full so we were seated immediately, right next to the server station. We watched server after server, at least 5 of them pass our table to put orders in the computer, server after server chat with each other, not one addressed our table. Not one said I will be your server I will be with you shortly. Not one said would you like some water. Not one said let me find who your server is. Not one. This went one for 15 minutes before we decided to get up and leave!  The service is terrible!!!
0;"My experience with Red Carpet VIP was pretty bad. After flying all the way to Vegas, at 9:45 PM the night of my sister's bachelorette party, I was told that we were not at Tao Nightclub but at Tao Beach upstairs, even though the contract I signed said \""Includes Private VIP Table TAO Nightclub\"". He said that our package of $1100 wasn't expensive enough to get a table at the nightclub. They acted like \""oh, its all the same club\"" but we couldn't even get into the VIP dance floor area at Tao Nightclub b/c our table was upstairs at Tao Beach. \n\nWe were also promised 2 bottles of alcohol, but I couldn't even tell what kind of alcohol it was because it was already out in 2 open carafes when we got there - which is dangerous because anyone could have slipped anything into them before we arrived. It was supposedly Stoli but I have no idea what it was b/c there were no bottles there and who knows if it was 2 full bottles or not. He offered a refund if I didn't like it, but my sister and 10 friends had flown all the way there and had planned on having a table so I kept it (which is part of the scam b/c they know its a bachelorette party and that you want a table)\n\nMy group was flexible and still had a nice time but the whole thing felt like this bait and switch scam and I felt taken advantage of. If you book with them get EVERYTHING IN WRITING including the brands of bottles and that you'll be able to actually see the bottles and where you will be placed in the building where the clubs are (upstairs at the pool vs. downstairs in the nightclub)\n\nI wouldn't recommend them b/c I don't trust them anymore."
4;Ever since I moved to Charlotte, Mac's fell in love with me. The more I tried to stay away the more they kept calling with more love (PBR on special in a tall boy). Yes, this is an Official PBR Joint, but besides that the food is awesome. Never had anything but the small plate BBQ, (menu is loaded with other BBQ and sandwich options as well), which for $10 is MORE than enough for anyone. Comes with 2 sides and Texas toast. Place is constantly busy and is a great spot for lunch or mid afternoon break (when I go). Lots of TV's inside and a great patio with picnic tables outside for those nice summer days. \n\nPlace is a biker bar, and like it's siblings in the Cornelius and Steele Creek areas, you'll have the occasional bike show. But no worries, it's a classy biker BBQ bar that draws the casual eater to the suit & tie business lunch. But as always, a bar stool and menu is all that is needed at Mac's!
1;"Last time we eat at the Kopper Keg. This is the second time we had bad experiences with their steaks for breakfast. Extremely tough with gross veins throughout. Complained to our server only to have her say \""I'm sorry\"". No refund was offered or discount off the bill. Sorry you had a bad dinning experience, but pay the bill and be on your way."
0;"If I could give Frances and Sons zero stars I would. First off, Francis and Sons left bugs on my windshield, spots on my hood and mirrors, and specks of dirt on all four doors. This was after buying the 27.99 \""Ultimate\"" car wash, and honestly my car wasn't that dirty to begin with. Secondly, Francis and Sons put a long scratch in my front quarter panel and my drivers side door and a smaller (but much deeper) scratch in my hood. When I reported this (before the car had even been moved) I was told that there was absolutely no way that they could have scratched my car as the employees wear no jewelry. When I pointed out that almost all of the employees were wearing belts with metal buckles, and that the scratches were belt height and looked like they were probably from someone leaning on my car while drying the windows, I was told that my scenario was impossible because the employees do not lean on the cars. When I pointed out employees leaning on the cars to dry the windows and doing the exact maneuvers that could cause their belts to scratch cars, the manager's only response was to say that belts are against company policy. When I asked the manager why he didn't make the employees take off their belts, he replied that I shouldn't insult his abilities as a manager. I will never go back!"
0;The female bartender/server is extremely un personable, it's like it is an inconvenience for her to serve her patrons. This has happened more than once with the same unsatisfactory results.. The food is great the drinks are awesome but the service is lackluster at best! That's why I seldom come here anymore! Imho.
0;I hate this hotel more than I can say.  I'd give them a negative star and beg people to tear it down, but the Forum shops are okay, and their concert venue is really nice, so I'll add a star for that.  Other than that, this place is overpriced and over-rated crap.\n\nTheir casino is awful.  Their machines have some of the lowest payouts in Vegas.  Their table games have some of the highest minimum bets on the strip, and their staff is snobbish and rude.  If you aren't laying down $100 per hand, then you are simply not worth their time. \n\nThe last time I was there was about a year ago. I actually had one of their pit bosses SNEER at me when I asked if there were any $10 Blackjack tables available, and he told me me it might be best if I found a lower class hotel to play in.  EXCUSE ME?!?!  I was wearing dress pants and a polo at the time, so it's not like I was looking trashy...I was just waiting for my concert to start and wanting to blow $100 or $150 while I waited.\n\nThe hotel itself was probably considered really nice when it was built in 1962, but it is completely dated and tacky compared to anything else on the strip.  It looks like some 60 year old Persian guy went nuts with marble statues and gold spray paint. (Not trying to be racist, but that stereotype is the only way I can think to describe the absurd level of tacky)\n\nDo yourself a favor.  Play somewhere else.  Oh, and for less money, you can upgrade to a pretty nice suite at any of the folowing for a MUCH better experience: Mirage, TI, the Monte Carlo, and the Venetian.
4;This is the best Mickey D's I have ever frequented! They have tables with flowers! The food looks perfect, like it's straight out of the commercial. Plus, I got coffee & a waitress actually walked around the place refilling peoples coffee, like a diner. Wholly sugar balls! That's classy.
1;"I've eaten in twice, today first time for take out. First rule, eat in... you easily get two or three times the amount of food for the same price. Next, check your order. I'm vegan and I always modify. My take out had meat in it. When I called back to ask nicely to remake my order, the guy argued with me and said \""the cook said he didn't put meat in it.\""  Trust me, I would be eating it if it didn't have meat in it. The food seems fresh, and like I said, if you eat in there's plenty for leftovers. Team Noodle, my real suggestion is to add a vegan pasta to the menu so there's no confusion or arguing with the \""cook\"" about what should be on the dish. Keep it simple and everyone will be happy."
0;DO NOT GO HERE!!!  Crappy dough pizza is subpar calzone was no good. Decent beers but expensive...  Go somewhere else :(
1;I was really excited to try this place but I just wasn't a fan.  First of all the bathroom had no soap for me to wash my hands.  The owner seemed really frazzled that he had just stocked the soap in there and maybe someone stole it.  He was helpful in getting some but it was still annoying.\n\nThen the dish I ordered was not good at all.... Hot Pot.  I'm sure it was an issue of personal tastes vs. quality but the whole vegetarian fake fish grossed me out.\n\nThe prices are a bit high and I just won't be going back.\n\nOh, I also tried the lemonade (expensive and I couldn't see or taste any mint in it.)
1;Mediocre sushi, extravagant prices.
0;"this is an expensive hotel.\nwith valet parking. we have a rental car that we drove straight from the airport to the hotel. we had checked the car with 3 people for scratches etc. none found. next day, when we got the car back from the valet; a big scratch. they are now \""investigating\"" whether it happened because of them.\nwe had to wait for ages in the lobby, and the guy helping us was unfriendly.\ntoday, on the 2nd day of our stay we come back after a long day in the desert just to find that our room has not been made up. no new towels, anything. also, the carpet in the room was full of stains. i was surprised to learn that this hotel is only 4 years old. the view was not the best; an abandoned parking lot. but the sunrise in the morning was amazing! (and for free, haha)\nthey pretend to be classy, but its just a bad hotel. \nthe bed and pillows were awful; the bed is much too soft and with springs. we stayed there 3 nights and each night i woke up multiple times, with a terribly back pain. (later during our holiday we slept on an air mattress and that was a relief, compared to the horrible trump-bed! can you imagine!)\noh, and the lobby is extremely smelly. like a lady that sprayed too much perfume on her before going out. it hurts your nose!\nwill never go here again, thats for sure."
2;"There was a lot of hype about this spot, I'm not saying I wasn't satisfied but I'm not saying I was as impressed as I thought I would be after all the hype.\nLike any other buffet, there are a lot of options and there was a long wait. The difference between this buffet and the majority of the buffets on the Vegas strip is that this one had lots of seafood options - which I prefer because I don't eat a lot of meat and if I could, I would only eat fish. Also, we had a Pescatarian in our group, so it was much easier than usual for her to find yummy food to eat. =] \nThe one thing I really enjoyed here was the desserts! They were made so beautifully and tasted like heaven!\nThe service and staff here was on point, not once during my meal was my drink anywhere empty nor was our table crowded of dirty dishes. [needless to say, our group left a good tip ;]\n\nThe price wasn't bad, especially since I ate lots of salmon poki & sushi; definitely ate my worth ;]\n\nWhen I go to Vegas again, I'll be eating here for dinner again since theres lots of seafood options and I'm not a steak and eggs kinda person."
4;Their service was AMAZING! I just had a digital perm done today at Cleo's and they were on top of everything! My hair turned out great and it took about three hours! They were also pretty busy. Had five people come in while I was there. One was getting hair dyed, another also a digital perm, and the others just haircuts. There were only two people working, and they were on top of everything and at the same time took their time and didn't rush! I love my digital perm! Thank you Cleo's!!
3;"i went on a sunday night, and it was incredibly easy to get in.  the complimentary admission passes were even lying in piles in the casino restroom for anyone to pick up.  the security guy tending the line let us in very quickly.  the other security guys standing on the stairs leading down from the line to the entrance were quite nice too, telling us: \""enjoy your evening.\""  perhaps coming on a sunday night influenced my positive opinion of the place, but here goes...\n\ni found the appearance and atmosphere of the club to be very sophisticated and exotic.  the waterfall is, of course, the centerpiece of tryst, as it overlooks the outdoor lagoon area.  it's a great place to get some fresh air, although during the summer heat, even at nighttime the open air won't cool you down.  there are two main bars (at least from what i noticed), and service was very fast.  even when the peak rush of the crowd arrived at the club, i didn't have to wait very long to get a bartender's attention.  their inredible hulks were some the best i've ever had, and it quickly became obvious why: they use hennessy vsop in their hulks, not the regular vs that everyone else uses with varied results.  the long islands were a little strong (no complaint there), and cheaper than the outrageously priced $17 long islands at The Bank, but i still thought the Bank had the better long island.\n\nthe dancefloor wasn't too big or too small.  it seemed to me that a large portion of the club's floor space was devoted to tables and booths, which i thought made the place appear more intimate.  however, a modestly-sized dancefloor and many tables could be a disaster on peak nights like saturdays.  but in my case, the whole setup was nice because i went on a sunday and the crowd size was just right.  the restrooms were nice; the sinks reminded me of the bathrooms in the harry potter movies! \n\nthe complimentary passes said that the music for the night was to be 70s, 80s, and 90s mash-ups.  that made me very hesitant to go at first, because i hate mash ups.  but it turned out they didn't do too many mash-ups at all.  they played mostly 90s and 2000s hip-hop and dance music, so i was happy for the most part."
3;As USOs go, this one is decent. \n\nThere's a sleeping area, there are 2 computers, drinks, snacks, and some frozen things that can be warmed up. The volunteers were nice and friendly as well. Not a bad place. :) \n\nIt's also the only one in the airport, so you might as well patronize it!
1;"Upon arriving there, I was soooo excited...the decor and the view as well as the ambiance were just to die for! But my main reason to go there was for what I thought was going to be great food and what a major disappointment that was. I consider myself a big foodie and I have to say that the food/recipes just didn't work at all and the dishes that were \""good\"" were just ok... We had no less than 12 dishes and they all kinda suck. I think that it's really hard to mess up italian food if you are a chef but I guess it can be done after all.\n\nAnother thing that was really disappointing was the overwhelming menu. Like I said, I'm a well-versed diner and that menu was waaaaaay too much. Took me and my friend,  who is also well-versed in dining out, about 30 minutes to oder. And we ended up going with a lot of their signature dishes/recommendations from the waitress and it wasn't good.\n\nAnd for my last comment, the service was \""too good\"" if you can call it that. The personel was always at our table making it a bit difficult to carry a conversation. \n\nI would love to give it another try later on if they change their menu but I would not spend my money on what's on that menu now. I would only go for the ambiance, the view and the drinks!"
0;Horrible experience,  I do not recommend.  The food was bad and overpriced.  My veal chop was all fat for 56 dollars. I complained and they did absolutely nothing and still charged me for it.
1;This place was awesome when I was a kid but not its trash.  They really need to renovate.  This is the hotel that all us broke people stay at when we go to Vegas.
1;I met clients here for bfast since they open early. There were four in our party and the waitress was attentive and friendly.\n\nBeing a homemade corn beef fan, I opted for this entree and when it arrived the size was overwhelming large like most of the entrees here. The corn beef was unfortunately overly salty and inedible so I only ate part of my scrambled eggs. When the waitress came by to check on us, I mentioned how bad my corn beef was and she asked if I wanted anything else which I declined. When our waitress returned she advised me she advised the chef and removed my entree from the bill which was a nice gesture. Everybody else in our party seemed to be happy with their food.\n\nI won't let this negative experience keep me away from Egg Works - hopefully the next experience will be better.
0;Not the best place to go if you're allergic to dairy.\n\nBasically all the sandwiches have cream cheese as a main ingredient. I ordered the veggie pate sandwich with tomatoes and had a cup of gazpacho with it. The gazpacho was huge and pretty good, but the sandwich was not very tasty. I found that there was too much bread, and the veggie pate didn't have the best flavour. I didn't finish it, despite being really hungry when I arrived. Also, the bread was dry and not toasted.\n\nThe Hubster had a chicken salad sandwich, which he said was pretty underwhelming. He was pretty put off by the fact that they don't serve alcohol.\n\nAside from that, they have a gorgeous back patio and good service.
4;"Not to start with the negative, but in the four times I have visited the Madison Public Library this past year, three of the times the elevator has been out of service! What is up with that?\n\nOk\n\nGot that out of the way. \n\nThat being said, the MPL is absolutely top notch. From the children's area, to the cafe, to the staff. We stop here whenever we get a chance. It is so much more then a library. I am especially drawn to the art aspects the MPL highlights. My sister (a local artist) shows here on occasion. Most Saturdays there are free art activities for children and adults alike. \n\nThe best for me is the \""bubbler room\"". No, not a place to get a cool drink of water. A place to learn about art, see art being produced, and to participate in the making. There is always something new. Do not leave without checking it out!"
2;ok, my girls love the fajitas
2;good for the desert, but not a big fan of the food. the portions are huge tho
0;"You think when you pay $3000 for a Lisik surgery that they you should be covered and that they will take pride if their work and if you need so called \""Enhancement\"" due to them not doing a good job to start with, but they need another $250 for that, the way they treated me I felt I was dealing with a car salesman!!  They say you signed the contract, this maybe legal but not right!"
2;"The decor of this place is really lovely.  It feels modern, yet old-school Italian at the same time.\n\nThe pear and gorgonzola salad I got was really nice, I think it would've been perfect with the addition of some beets!  The only reason I give this place 3 stars and not 2 is because I liked the salad.\n\nOn the downside, the pizza wasn't great.  And for a place that is a pizzeria, that's pretty important.  The crust was thinner than I expected and didn't have a particularly nice texture.  It kind of felt like the crust on frozen pizzas.  Also the sauce was WAYYY too sweet.  Don't trust the reviewer who said the sauce is \""slightly\"" sweet, it's SUPER sweet.  So much so that I wanted to eat more of my pizza, but also felt sick at the thought of trying to eat any more."
1;I know I seem like a crazy person who can't make up my mind on this restaurant, but I think I'm done with it. Went here a few more times in the last 6 months or so, the eggs florentine went south.... eggs not cooked correctly, hollandaise was gluey... produce not so fresh. Went last weekend, got two eggs and bacon with potatoes. The eggs were cooked well but flavorless... the whole plate was flavorless. I broke up pieces of bacon and mixed it with the potatoes and put the eggs on top.... still not good. The potatoes were undercooked, crunchy still, and had no seasoning whatsoever, it was just a bland pile of grease... yuck. On top of that, we waited over 30 minutes for a table. I don't think I'll be back, there are too many good breakfast places around to continue to go to a bad one.\n\n\nPS The service here continues to be very friendly, so that is a plus.
1;Today I had to wait toooo long for the chit chat to end with the cashier and a talkative customer.  Socialization is fine but with six or so other employees within sight it didn't fit the Starbucks image of efficiency.  \n\nTwo different employees punched keys on the second register in front of me and then walked away assuming the other register was soon to be freed up... Maybe... ???\n\nI finally got my usual tall Pikes Place so all is well that ends well so to speak...
4;Cheap, fast, decent atmosphere, and great flavor. You can't go wrong at Tosinos. We stepped in on a weekday for lunch and it wasn't crowded at all. The wall menu is digital, with pictures of their various items scrolling through the screens.\n\nI ordered a carne asada burrito ($4.75). At less than $5, this was a great deal. The burrito was made in just a few minutes, huge and filled to the brim with lots of carne asada meat, guacamole, onion, and tomato. The salsa bar on the side had 2 different red sauces, a green sauce, and lime wedges, which were great condiments to compliment the burrito. The nicely grilled tortilla held all the ingredients in well.\n\nThe restaurant has a lot of booths for people to sit at, and compared to other places that serve similar quickie Mexican food (Los Favoritos, Filibertos), the atmosphere here is a step up from them!\n\nDefinitely a new favorite for Mexican food in this area!
1;The coffee and staff are amazing. However the doughnuts are WAY too greasy and don't taste as good as they look!
2;I am such a huge fan of Sugar Factory.  When I worked on then strip I used to take my staff to then location at Paris.  I was so impressed that about 2 years ago I had my team dinner there and then last year we had a bachelorette dinner there too.  I always enjoy then appetizers and fruity cocktails! This past Wednesday my husband and I decided to celebrate our anniversary with the kids at the location at Town Square because my daughter wanted to go to the park and I wanted my daughter to enjoy the desserts. The positive as I walked in is that the drinks were 50% off (I later found out that appetizers are too based on the yelp page and my server didn't even give us the 50% off, even after I had to correct him on giving me 50% off the drinks- maybe he wasn't sure if we would tip off the regular price- who knows?).  \n\nFirst disappointment - no bubble gum iced tea\n\nSecond disappointment - our server didn't even tell us about Happy Hour but he told the table next to us\n\nThird disappointment- our appetizer baked brie took forever. My husband noticed that the table of girls got the same appetizer before us and they ordered way after us.  I said maybe ours is coming out next.  My 1 year old was a little fussy so we went walking around the mall.  I came back about 15 minutes.  My husband was shaking his head and didn't look too happy.  I said what happened.  He said he watched our baked brie go from the table next to us (as they finally told the server it wasn't theirs) to inside the restaurant to right back to us.  He didn't say anything as we pretty much don't like to say anything especially when other people are cooking your food.  I know I should have but I just wanted to enjoy my anniversary dinner with my family.  My husband was already irritated and grouchy that I just wanted to eat my food and leave. A minute later our entrees were dropped and no silver ware on the table.  We asked for another set of silverware because she only bought 2 and there were 4 of us.  The server said to my husband you need one too...um, yes, how else would he eat his crepe?   We didn't get to enjoy desserts because we were upset with the experience and just wanted to leave and take then kids to the park.\n\nPositives- food was great - macaroni pops, garbage salad and chicken crepe was very delectable.  (Although we didn't enjoy the brie because it was cold and the fact that it was sitting on another table was just not appetizing after)\n\nI really hope they make it at that spot because that's the 3rd or 4th restaurant in there.  They really need to step up the game with service and let everyone know about happy hour and give them the happy hour price!
2;I liked it a lot when it first opened last year. The line was so long and you always need to get there 30 minutes before you open to get a seat immediately, otherwise you would need to wait for at least an hour. It was worth the wait because of the atmosphere that's good for dating and seafood was very fresh. However, everything changed. Their seafood is no more fresh, but their prices are way higher than the average. I don't really have a reason going there anymore. Why would you pay more to get something very average?
4;This is our new favorite hotel in Vegas! We stayed in the 1 bedroom terrace suite in the east tower with view of the strip. Room layout was terrific! It felt like our own little condo.  Only minor compliant I had was that being right on the strip, it was always super noisy!  \nIf you are going for a quiet holiday I recommend asking for a room in the west tower, but if you don't mind the noise and want a priceless view of the strip then go for the east tower.
2;The food isn't as good as it once was.  The atmosphere is kind of dark and needs to be updated.  We ordered potato pancakes that had to be returned because they somehow tasted fishy (I don't even want to speculate).  The other items we ordered were ok. Staff is great, very friendly and attentive.
1;This place is straight slummin, but what do you expect for 50 bucks a night. Personally, I dont spend much time holed up in my hotel room when I am in Vegas so if I can scrimp money here and there to feed the ole gambling addiction or head out for a nice dinner, I would gladly do so. Just don't turn on the fan in your room because it will make the whole room smell like a NYC subway station. The TV's were also made in the same year of my mom's birth. \n\nBut whatever, the location is great. It's literally right in the middle of the strip across from Caesar's.  So check into your room, get showered and dressed up, and don't come back until you've outraced the moon.
1;"If Park Central Mall could speak, it would scream, \""Stop looking at me! Stop it! I know, I know. I've let myself go. How can I compete with Kierland or Biltmore? I'm just ugly. I'm Jan and Kierland is Marcia. It's always Kierland, Kierland, Kierland.\""\n\nStaryucks, (yes, I said Staryucks, catchy, huh?) is the flagship store here. Gag me. Central Ave. deli, a great gift shop and Kobalt (is it still open?), Jamba Juice...yawn yawn yawn...\n\nMy only hope for this once famous mall, is the light rail. Yes, I'm bankin on the light rail people. And no, Kristin, I haven't been drinking. I have this vision in my head, and the need to open up that space. Throw in the obligatory Banana Republic, Restoration Hardware and Orange Julius. OK, the Orange Julius is for me. Used to love those babies. \n\nI just may \""borrow\"" one of these demolition tractors I see all over Central and ram a big hole into it. Then we plant some trees and flowers. Hire whimsical musicians, actors and unicorns for the grand opening. I give a speech in my chains and shackles (for the grand theft and destruction of property) and we all rejoice!\n\nDon't hold your breath folks. But at least keep your fingers crossed."
0;Where do I start.  I ordered a pie for delivery about a month ago, and it got here late.  I didn't worry about it, but the driver did apologize.\n\nToday, I received a coupon for a free large pie due to the last late delivery, so I thought I would use it.\n\nTo make a long story short, I should have just placed the order for pick up over the phone.  Apparently, phone orders trump walk in business at this location.\n\nEven though I was the only customer for nearly 30 minutes, my order was placed dead last behind any phone order that was called in.\n\nDominos...Pizza Hut...Papa John's...it's all the same.\n\nAt least Dominos is hot and fresh to your door in 30 minutes.\n\nWe're in an Economic Depression.  I don't need to spend money at a place that has no customer service...and no comprehension of process.\n\nHasta, Papa.  You blow.
2;"Stingray was pretty good, but lacking in a couple areas... but what was good was good enough to give them another try.\n\nStarting with the food we had:  the grouper cheek appetizer with Asian mushrooms was absolutely scrumptious.  Never had food served over mashed potatoes in a sushi place but this dish worked.  The fish melted in our mouths, the mushrooms had that nice bite you get from dried shrooms, and the sauce was savory and satisfying.  Next:  Recovery Roll, something they say the proceeds go to the Japan quake relief effort.  I'm not big on rolls but this one was very nice, spicy tuna is the star and the supporting cast makes this a good roll for the money.  and YES!  Toro was available, pricey at $19 but the fatty tuna was sensational.  What surprised us was that they were out of Ama-Ebi (shrimp w/ heads) and Uni (urchin), two staples of any sushi feast.  really disappointed. \n\nServer was personable and friendly, but occasionally inattentive.  Request for water was forgotten, and request for water refill was forgotten.  probably the weakest part of our experience.\n\nDecor is beautiful and comfortable, and I disagree with the poster who said the inside tables are too close together... that encourages interaction with other diners which I love when dining out for sushi.\n\nSo I will go back, but if the \""sorry we're out of that\"" theme persists, it will be the last time... please keep the water topped off..."
4;BEST DENTAL OFFICE EVER! \nI came in with a broken lower teeth that started acting up. I literally wanted to rip my tooth out of freakin face. Now I know I should have had it fixed way back in the days but I was a kid and didn't know better. It started acting up for the past couple of months but I just walked it off. I couldn't take the pain any more and decided to do something about it. I remember my friend had her wisdom teeth taken out and asked her where she went. She is as much of a BIG BABY as I am. I seriously cry over any little cut, scrap, or splinter. This is why I haven't been to a dentist in....... 7 years. \nThe girl who made my appointment was so nice a friendly. I would say ask for the funny one but they are all pretty funny. They made me feel very comfortable and were joking around with me. I love that! I was still nervous to hear what the doctor would say but those girls made me laugh. Could have been a nervous laugh though. I got called in pretty quick and sat down in a chair. \nThe assistant (I believe her name is Carla.....) was nice a chatty with me. She noticed that I was pretty much choking the arm rest. She told me to not worry and as she took my x-rays. THANK GOD THEY HAD PITCH PERFECT PLAYING! I could get my mind off that darn tooth. \nDr. Lee came into my room and introducted himself and told me what's going on. He explained the options I have, the pros and cons of what I needed, and really explained everything. All in all, YAY I can keep my tooth! I was able to get my tooth fixed and get a cleaning too. I never felt comfortable in a medical office before and I actually was able to loosen the choke hold on the arm chair. I even scheduled my next cleaning.\n\nTHANK YOU SUMMERLIN SMILES!
0;I was thinking to go this restaurant from long time at last I did dine in last night & we didn't like their food pls don't waste your money..
3;"We ate here last June because we had 4:00pm show reservations for the Popovich Comedy Pet Theater at the V Theater (If you like animals and circus acts without the cracking of the whip, then go! But that's another review for another time). We decided to show up early (12:30) to pick up the VIP tickets and take a walk around the Miracle Mile Shops. All of a sudden, our 9 year old daughter says that she is hungry and I opted to get the family a nice treat. Besides, I had not eaten here since it was the Aladdin. As we approached the buffet, we were pleasantly surprised to find that the line for lunch was fairly reasonable for midday weekday lunch.\n\nMuch to my surprise, nothing had changed about this place except for some cosmetic touches to the dining area. The salad section had fresh bamboo shoots and whole peeled beets (score!). There were so many sections to choose from that I did not want overdo it on one section.\n\nThe seafood section was pretty good. The sushi looked OK but it\ns buffet sushi.  The highlight of the station is the crab meat stuffed sole and paella. Delicious and well seasoned.  The Middle Eastern section was to die for with flavorful hummus, naan bread, tandoori chicken and chicken curry. The tabouleh salad and the curry sauce were good as well. The only meh part of the meal was the shrimp Pad Thai. Since I am 1/2 Thai, I did not expect a Vegas buffet to perfect Thai cooking like they do here in the LA area where I live. Could have used a little more tamarind, but I like my Pad Thai a little tangy than most. I'll give the cooks an A for effort since they used the right type of rice noodle (Sen Lek).  If I wanted Thai food, I'd go to a Thai restaurant.   There were many places to hit but the stomach only has so much room.  Unless I wanted to relive the scene from Monty Python's movie \""The Meaning of Life.\""  (I'll refrain from spoiling the scene)\n\nOur 9 year old loved the dessert buffet. The fresh spun cotton candy was the highlight for her. I took a bite and it was pretty good. The flan was delicious and the cannolis were pretty good as well. I like the Orleans' cannolis better at the French Market Buffet but the Spice Market's were not bad. No pecan pie that I could see but that's not a deal breaker. My wife had the bread pudding and said it was OK.\n\nWill definitely come back and eat another meal at this buffet. Next time we'll try to see if we can get in at the tail end of lunch so we can try some of the dinner items when they change from lunch to dinner.  If you do a Google seach,  you can find $5.00 off coupons for this place which they will take.  Now I need to find the 25% coupons that I have heard a lot about."
0;"I was looking for a 5S in any carrier because I wanted to pay full price. \n\nWhen I walked in at 12:15pm, the greeter was very rude and annoying. I knew what I wanted. He asked me with an attitude \""you buying a phone and you don't know which carrier you want?\"" Then I patiently told him I wanted either Verizon or Tmobile because they're unlocked to all carriers. He said there were Silver and Space gray 5S for Tmobile avaiable. Then he walked me to the manager. \n\nThe manager was even ruder and unknowledgeable. Everyone knows Verizon 5S is factory unlocked but she kept insisting it's locked to Verizon only. Then she told me to wait while she double-checking. She never got back to me at all and kept me waiting for so long. After a while until I couldn't wait any longer, I asked if anyone was coming to assist me then they sent a man to assist me after a few more minutes.\n\n The man who assisted me asked me to wait again so he could check if they had stock available. Then he came back and told me there were no 5S left. \n\nPeople at this store had to be kidding me. They're not only unknowledgeable but also very rude. They keep wasting my time for nothing. I never write reviews but this time I have to. \n\nI've been to Chandler, Biltmore, Scottsdale Apple stores but never experienced this joke before. \n\nApple needs to do something with the staff at this store or else you'll being losing more Apple fans like me. This store doesn't even worth 1 star."
0;We got food poisoning here! Big disappointment because our food and experience was so wonderful. We both had the tasting menu which had two fish dishes on it. My suggestion would be to stay away from seafood when you are not by the ocean!
0;"uhhhhh i just got delivery for the first time- gave the guy a tip and he goes \""is that it?\"" and my pizza was $20? wow, expensive. i lost my appetite. anyone want some pizza?"
2;I agree with everyone that yelp needs to implement some half stars because this place isn't quite a 3 star, much more a 2.5.\n\nPortions are pretty good sized and the food is decent. It tastes like every other american food restaurant you could go too and they dont put a special spin on anything. I loved our waitress and our bartender and they were super friendly and made us feel welcome, I just wasn't happy about spending $12 for some fish and chips that was a mediocre meal.\n\nFor being in a hotel its a good deal, and is definitely not something I'd tell anyone to avoid when they come in late from a flight or a long day at the office, I'm just saying get out into Phoenix and try some of the local favorites if you can. (Ask the hotel staff where the shuttle will take you!!)
1;I wouldn't come back.\n It wasn't completely horrible, but I won't be back.\n\nThe guacamole is excellent. The margaritas were very good. The problem was the entr\u00e9es.  Tampico which was highly recommended,  was mediocre and lacked flavor. As did the chicken enchiladas and the mahi tacos. Very bland. Coffee was TERRIBLE. The apple pie dessert is great. The waiter was helpful and attentive.\n \nSo that's the problem. Apps and desert are wonderful. The entrees are boring and very expensive for Mexican. \n\nBut then again what did Burt expect from a Mexican food chain located in an Italian themed mall in Las Vegas?
2;"First off, let me just say I LOVE a place that still puts a Monte Cristo sandwich on the menu, even if I did make a New Year's resolution about fried foods.  I like old school friendly coffee shops and this has that charm.  Sadly, that's where it ended for us.\n\nMy Monte Cristo (did you think I wouldn't order it?), while tasty inside, was overdone and dark brown, not golden, just this side of burnt. It wasn't very big, nor loaded with meat, which is weird for a Monte Cristo since the whole idea of a triple layer ham, swiss and turkey sandwich dipped in french toast batter, fried and coated in powdered sugar is to be colossal and leave you stuffed.  The bread was standard grocery store loaf size.  It was offered with potatoes or hash browns, but I ordered fruit, which was melon and not very good.  End of story for me.\n\nHub had the House Original sandwich; roast beef and cream cheese with red onion , tomato and lettuce.  He asked for no tomato, and also sadly ordered fruit.\n\nThe sandwich was a shocker, with no more than a 1/4 lb of meat and cream cheese spread thin.  It also had tomato on it...oops. The beef was not freshly sliced.  The bread was again nothing special, average size and not extremely fresh.  For a signature sandwich, it was a big disappointment to my better half.  We were both still hungry when we left.\n\nThe service was very nice, quick, and pleasant, though I don't particularly like being called 'dear' by someone maybe 10 to 15 years younger than me.  I'm not a blue hair!"
4;"I have stayed here numerous times and I absolutely love it!!!  Here are a list of reasons I think this is the best hotel on the strip:\n\n- Location - situated about in the middle of the action and next to the Bellagio (try and get a fountain facing room) and part of the whole complex of hotels\n- Restaurants - there are quite a few great restaurants on the property. The buffet is definitely among the better options in Vegas; Great burger place, Holsteins, with unbelievable milk shakes (with or without liquor); mexican-asian place, etc.\n-Pools - three or four pools with great 'scenery.'  There is also the Marquee Club at one of the pools\n-Balconies - not many, if any, hotels in Vegas have balconies.  If you can, get a suite - the balcony wraps around and it is unbelievable!\n-Marriott property - so if you're like me and like rewards, get in on it\n\nOther that the above, the Cosmo is definitely more upscale, and higher class than some of the mass casinos located elsewhere.  Won't stay anywhere else!"
0;Ha! They tried to make us pay $30 cover. Yeah right. Well, we got in for free 99 but this spot was wack and overcrowded with lots of wackos. You won't see me in this club again.
0;"I \""did not love this bar\"" Toby's place in OK City is great, this place is its polar opposite!  Was seated quickly then left &forgotten. Sat for 25min without so much as a hello or can I get you a drink? Toby Keith would of been very disappointed with this lack of hospitality. We got up, told the manager why we were leaving, then left."
3;Had a bbq burger with sweet potato fries...great burger with great atmosphere. Had a lot of fun, the parking lot is small...I didn't get to eat the fries but I'm liking forward to it
0;I will never eat here again. I got corn beef and hashand it was like eating cat food. My friends toast came out burnt and 20 minutes after we ordered. The butter on the toast was just a squeeze butter. The chicken fried steak was absolutely horrible. It was just bread. Then to top it off as we were checking out the hostess didn't understand the fact that I wanted to do half cash half card. She just charged it's all on to my card. Every one was VERY disorganized.  I've heard some great things about this place. But my experience was very shitty. I will not be returning.
1;Marie Callenders has kickass pie. Sadly I was not able to enjoy said pie on my last visit, I was far too annoyed with the craptacular service we received to spend anymore time waiting for pie. \n\nMyself, my boss and two of my coworkers decided to go to Marie Callenders for lunch, we were all having the soup and salad bar with iced tea. Very simple order, we should have been an easy tip for our waitress.. If she put in any effort at all that is... \n\nOnce we were seated in an almost empty dining room (only two other tables with customers), it took over 5 minutes for our waitress to come over and take our drink order. She said she would bring the drinks right over as well as the complimentary cornbread while we went to the salad bar. The four of us all went through the salad bar to get our salads, took them back to our table, went back up for bowls of soup and were seated before she came out with our drinks and bread. Only... not really. The cornbread she brought out with our drinks was given to the table next to us. We also had to take two sets of silverware off of an empty table near us, as our waitress didn't even ensure we all had proper eating utensils. \n\nI was thirsty so I drank half of my iced tea as soon as I got it. Then I worked on my salad, waiting for the cornbread to enjoy with my soup. And waiting. And waiting. And drinking more of my tea... Finally, we have cornbread. And my glass is 2/3 empty. An attentive waitress would have noticed, this one did not.\n\nI ended up drinking half of a coworkers drink because the waitress neglected our table for so long. We had to get her attention as she delivered the check to the other table to get a refill. By this point, my boss (who was paying) was fed up and had his credit card out. Who knows how long it would have taken to get the check. \n\nIf the place was busy... or even if the waitress has a decent attitude... waiting for a refill and then check wouldn't be a deal-breaker for me. But it wasn't, and she didn't... And while the salad bar and soup were ok, they weren't THAT great.  I won't be back.
1;A monstrosity of a complex. I have a few friends living here and the place is just too big. The location however is perfect - it's as in old town as you can get. Parking is a headache with a five floor gated parking garage. Getting friends in or pizza delivered can be a challenge. They recently renovated the pool area.
4;I must hand it to them at Olive and Ivy! First rate atmosphere and food.\nThe pesto is the most flavorful I have ever had and that includes pesto I have eaten in Italy.\nWine selection is terrific. The breakfast, lunch and dinners are wonderful. The bar feels a bit like a meat market but that is the only down side.\nIt is beautiful, clean and worth returning to again and again.
0;The only reason I am leaving a one star review is because I can't leave less. The HOA staff at Park Avenue are indubitably the most miserable people I have ever encountered. David Olsen is by far the worst. Unprofessional, condescending, disrespectful, unhelpful, discriminatory, and ignorant beyond belief. I have NO idea how these people are running a business. They make unfactual outrageous claims against current and potential tenants as well as guests and violate the fair housing act as well as ADA regulations. I would rather spend 5 hours at the DMV then spend 5 minutes trying to get any relevant information from them or resolve an issue. Unbelievable. If you're thinking of living here, don't. No apartment is worth dealing with these inconceivably abhorrent human beings.
1;"Well the Square cafe is highly rated, personally I think there are a ton of better breakfast places out there. I got a classic breakfast, so it should be basic but this was too basic. No flavor in the home fries, I mean how hard would it be to add salt and pepper or some kind of store bought seasoning. It was fairly busy but I'd call it a normal rush; however before I finished eating I was handed the check. I think they they probably are nice or friendly but I didn't experience it. A combination of so-so food and not great service make this the one and only time I will be visiting."
2;B&B is pretty solid, which is what you would expect from a Batalli place. Service was great, food was good too. I give the slight edge to Mozza in LA. \nI had the burratta with charred ramps, the beef cheek ravioli with black truffles and crushed duck lover sauce, and the braised short rib. All solid. My wife had the pistachio and beet salad and the gnocchi with English peas. They even manage to make some noodles for the kids with a simple butter sauce - and actually, pretty darn excellent.
3;"i was excited to try this pizza place after reading about it on facebook.\n(please bear with me, this is my first yelp review)\n\nambiance: casual pizza-place decor. there was a scrabble game going on one of the tables in the front, i liked that.\n\nservice: wonderful. i did take out, so i walked right up to the counter where there was only one guy working. he was incredibly friendly and helped us pick out what to order while preparing other people's orders. i enjoy watching the cooking process so it was interesting to watch my food being made.\n\nfood: we ordered a stromboli and a large pizza.\n\nstromboli: my friend described it as a \""bad ass hot pocket\"". we ordered \""the thaddius\"" which was cheese, marinara, ham, sausage, pepperoni and salami wrapped in dough. it is also served with a side of marinara sauce to dip in. it is cut in two, so great to split for 2 people. (the thaddius was $10)\n\npizza: we ordered half chicken half pineapple. both were delicious, the cheese melts beautifully and tastes wonderful. the dough is crispy on the outside but nice and soft in the middle. the amount of toppings we got (both chicken and pineapple) was very generous. all ingredients were very fresh.\n\ni will definitely be going back."
1;"I went to Kona Grill for the first time this past weekend, after having it recommended to me MANY times.  I have to say I was a bit disappointed.  Maybe because of all the hype.\n\nThe food was pretty good (I had the chopped salad with macadamia nut crusted chicken), but not great.  We also ordered a sushi roll to share as an appetizer, and that was good.  The three others in my party all said their entrees were \""good,\"" too... but no one was raving about any of it.  Our desserts were GIANT and tasted good.\n\nThe really bad part of our experience, was definitely our flaky waiter.  As I said, we ordered our sushi as an appetizer... and he even asked if we wanted it before our entrees and we said yes... but after waiting a long time (probably about 20 minutes), our roll came at the same time as our entrees.\n\nThen after we ate our entrees, we sat and sat and sat and sat, waiting for the dessert menu.  After about 20 minutes of not seeing our waiter at all (not even at tables around us), we finally asked a busser if he could find our waiter.  We watched the busser look for him all around the kitchen and the dining room.  I'm not sure where our waiter was hiding, but it took another five minutes just to find him.  When he finally did show up, he gave us our bill without even bringing the dessert menu.\n\nHe took the bill back and finally brought us a dessert menu, and we asked him what he recommended.  He said \""let's be honest... I'm gonna tell you everything on the menu is good.\""  Umm... ok.\n\nSo I don't really want to judge the restaurant on this really bad waiter... because I am sure not EVERY waiter there is that awful... but with so many other great places to eat in town, we definitely won't be going back any time soon."
4;Great service, delicious food with huge portions! I was a little skeptical about eating waffles with chicken but the flavors compliment each other beautifully. I wish the waffles were belgin style but other than that I loved them. They were made with cinnamon and the syrup was amazing. I had the KK (number 1) which also came with grits and eggs. I could have done without them but only because it was so much food. Next time I wanna try the Mac n cheese and collard greens.
3;Sushi Roku stakes claim to an amazing ambiance. The modern vibe and styling of the W Hotel that Roku is located in, carried over and translated very well into the restaurant. I loved the upscale and hip vibe! My party and I decided to each order a roll... We're from California and are spoiled with our fresh seafood. There was a question mark on how the sushi in Scottsdale would compare to that of the bay area. Everyone was VERY pleased with both the portion sizes and the quality. The lobster roll was a table favorite. For dessert, we ordered the dessert spring rolls. They were amazing!!!!!!! Um... think spring roll filled with berries. banana, and paired with vanilla ice cream. Now, imagine what heaven would taste like, and there was our rolls!\n\nNext time I find myself in Scottsdale, I would absolutely return!
2;"A bit closer to 2.5 stars but my server was super friendly so that is why it's a 3.\n\nI was craving a burger and had seen this place mentioned a few times being named as one of the \""Best Burgers in Phoenix\"".   I decided to come down and check it out.  Pay parking which you can get validated.  They use plastic tokens...reminded me of a small poker chip.  Anyways..........walked inside and was seated against the wall.  My server came over and asked me if it was my first time here etc.  She went over the whole drill.  I decided to order the Zinburger (minus mayo), an order of fresh cut fries and a Diet Pepsi to drink.  Here is how everything tasted.................\n\nZinburger-  ($10.50)  This is a ground beef patty (I'm assuming 1/3 lb...it was a good sized patty) topped with manchengo cheese, zinfandel braised onions, and lettuce.  I ordered mine medium and it came out perfect.  It was presented nicely but it was lacking greatness.  I took a bite of the meat itself and it tasted really great...like steak!  The cheese was melted on top of the burger and the onions were layered nicely on top of the cheese.  It came on a soft \""fancy\"" bun.  Each item itself was great...when combined though, it left something to be desired.  All I could really taste was bread and onions.  The meat/burger was not the star of the show.  The lettuce addition was a little weird too.  It probably would have been better without.  It was a decent enough burger but for a \""fancy\"" higher end burger joint, I expected more.  It ain't cheap either!  \n\nHand Cut Fries-  ($5.00)  These things were actually really good.  They give you a nice sized mound of them.  They were hot and crispy and delicious.  They needed just a bit more salt, but other than that, they were really good.  Better/more memorable than the burger.\n\nDiet Pepsi- Is what it is.\n\nWhy only 2.5/3 stars?  For a burger, fries and drink, it was $19.98...that is before tip!  I will never ever ever ever ever ever pay $25.00 to come back here for simple comfort food.  It's just way too expensive for what you get!   The staff was all pretty friendly, the layout is cool (kind of a hipster vibe), and they validate parking for up to 2 hours.  I am glad I came to check it out, but sadly I will not be returning...the value is just not there.  Once I hit that lotto and move to Scottsdale, then we can come here often lol."
1;"OK guys! This is a solid Yelp-recommended kappo place. I really loved the overall experience, up until the very end, when suddenly I got one unexpected & unfortunate issue with it. When we finished dinner (we had ordered a huge load of food and paid about $57 per person, for 2 people, incl. a good 18% tip) we exited the restaurant and the predominantly Japanese staff didn't say a simple thank you. The Japanese host (manager?) saw us leaving, turned a blind eye and continued chatting with the waitress as if we didn't exist.\n\nI regret giving you a lower rating (I initially intended a 5) but I am an emotional and spoiled client- I got upset... I'm half Japanese... I know it is not written on my (Caucasian) face, but I am. My appearance is not an excuse for anyone to forget to say a simple \""thank you\"" especially when it's part of the Japanese cultural code. As we all know. Even a Korean-owned Japanese restaurant in LA area is trying to always say \""Arigato Gozaimasu\"" (with a heavy accent, but still, polite and respectful). I never had an experience where Japanese nationals operating a restaurant- in the US or in Japan- disregarded this centuries-old cultural rule.\n\nOK... the tantrum is over now, guys- sorry. Yelp is all about being subjective and emotional about our experiences- and it is exactly what I am doing. I wish that I had the desire to write more about the food rather than freaking out regarding a cultural issue...\n\nIn spite of the \""shitsurei\""- hopefully an isolated incident without any mean attitude or intentions behind it- I DO RECOMMEND this restaurant as one of the good Nihon-ryori restaurants in Las Vegas. Also, conveniently, it is open quite late. Maybe other Yelpers who are less spoiled or less familiar with Japanese customs (not expecting as much from their experience) will really have a blast."
0;"This place is LAME!!!!  The food was mediocre and I still had to wait 30 minutes after dinner to get a stamp to go upstairs, because they couldn't find the \""stamp girl\"".  When i complained the staff was rude and didn't really care to help us out and they just kept telling us to wait but i didn't see anyone doing anything about it.   The WORST customer service I have experienced in my life and super crowded...don't go here unless you have bottle service, or better yet don't go at all.  I would recommend avoiding this place at all cost and going somewhere else to spend your money."
4;Ok... so I woke up spontaneous this morning and decided to get a full car tinting... I happened to be browsing groupon app and found Alex and Denise' 305 Kustoms website the night before with a ton of phenomenal reviews from yelp... and they carry the renegade and 3M films which are both top-o-the-line materials... so after I grabbed a big wad of cash for rent and utilities I just drove westward towards their business area.. since it was a nice day in las vegas to just blockout the 120 degree summer that usually lasts until October... I got to 305 Kustoms at 8 am so I got to give them my business to start their day.. and let me tell ya that I am so happy with choosing their 35% VLT renegade film that I told Denise to just keep the change for the awesome work that her teammembers did for my vehicle.... I guarantee you that I'm coming back here for more epic tinting for my girlfriend's car and highly recommending these folks to my best friends and coworkers... they haven't seen the last of me yet because I will make sure to keep their shop open with more business that I will be bringing... I work for Sands corporation which is the largest resort here in Sin City by the way so you know I'm bringing in a ton of clients for 305 Kustoms in the near future.. I also discovered that they have a facebook so I'm heading there after I finish here... Good honest kind people like Alex and Denise here in Vegas is hard to find like a pearl in the ocean so we as locals should do our part to maintain their longevity... I got 5 on it.. 5 stars for 305 Kustoms!!!!!!!!!!!
2;'Monte Carlo Resorts and Casino...now with 100% LESS SUCK!'\n\nI feel that should be the new ad slogan because I haven't had the most positive experience with this place in the past, but time and time again I would book a room here because for a centrally located strip hotel, it ranked as one of the cheaper options. \n\nand then each time I stayed I was rudely reminded why.\n\nLet's see, where can I start: the rooms are drab, the window views are dismal, even when you're looking out the 'front of the hotel' you see a crap view of empty lots and the freeway.  The restaurants are nothing special and there is not hot nightclub venue that draws in the nightcrowd.  This place is like the Holiday Inn Express of the strip, clean but boring, and purely a place to sleep and maybe partake in the buffet.\n\nSo this trip my friend who booked the room asked me what my hotel prefs were and I said 'I dont really care, just prefer no Monte Carlo'  and of course guess where we ended up.\n\nHowever this time around I noticed the whole experience felt different.  Ever since the completion and opening of MGM Group's crown jewel Aria City Center, i suspect they have infused a bit more cash and life into this once drab resort.  It's not glaringly obvious but little things like the rooms, amenities and service seem much better, and their shops have new additions with the biggest plus...internal walkway to City Center connecting it to Aria and no longer making the hotel feel like a cut off locked in the attic stepchild.  Also access to the tram gives you free mobility to go to City Center and Bellagio with a gorgeous almost futuristic view of that section of the strip in AC'ed tinted windowed comfort.  Even the crappy pool area seems to have new life as I tried the lazy river and wave pools which seemed quite fun.\n\nWhatever MGM did, they sucessfully transformed MC from a solid 'bleah' to 'yeah its ok' hotel in my mind.  The style, amenities and rooms will never approach a Palazzo or Wynn level, but I feel like its not meant to, and thats ok, because you dont have to pay those level prices either.
2;Sushi: Unfortunately this place isn't AYCE (all you can eat) so I'm not sure how this place cam compare to a lot of good sushi places without converting to all you can eat like most places. Their sushi is decent I'm not much of a roll person but my favorite roll is at this location out of all the sushi places I've been. The Bonzai roll which is a salmon, crab meat, avocado, deep fried and and served with creamy tangy sauce. \n\nTeppan: This is the only sushi restaurant I've seen with Teppan which is a style of Japanese cooking where the chef cooks in front of you. Which is a pretty neat experience, most of the time these chefs are super social so they're not just chefs but also cooking entertainers.\n\nCustomer Service: The customer service here is pretty decent, expect one time I had a hard time flagging a girl down to refill my hot green tea and also had a hard time trying to get my check. \n\nLocation: This place is right off the free way of 95 & Craig which makes it a prime location also its in a busy shopping center and on the far side of the shopping center so people passing by can see their sign on the side of their building.
0;disgusting.  i'm here right now and it smells horrible, like urine. note to jasons deli: clean your bathrooms thoroughly. if you have tables (8 tables) near the restroom, remember......people are eating and dont want to smell pee!
3;I love this place the staff are great as is the food ......the coffee though welllll  a coffee house that uses a broken espresso machine that burns the beans now thats not good. should have spent some money on the espresso machine  instead of that great big new awning   but hey the reg. coffee is still top notch
3;We hit Vegas twice a year. We do a lot of walking, but we also get an adequate monorail pass for those long trips. Although, by the time you cut through the casino to the train you could have walked. But it's still fast and safe. We've always had a great experience, until recently. That's why it gets 4 stars and not 5. We were at the MGM stop and we accidently purchased a 3 day when we needed a 2 day. I asked the attendant...who barely spoke English if we could trade in our passes and get a refund on the difference or get a refund and purchase the appropriate ticket. She was very rude. She went on a tangent about how she would have to submit for a refund that takes days to approve (yeah right) meanwhile we'd still need to purchase our 2 day pass. We didn't feel it was worth the supposed procedure so we just kept our 3 day pass and went on about our business. I don't care that she didn't trade them or whatever but she was rude. She acted appalled that I even asked. She even called over a co-worker who was equally rude. Get over yourself wench, you work at the monorail stop!!! this was the lady at the MGM stop inside where you purchase tickets from the kiosk. Broken English and rude makes me want to reach out and touch someone.
3;I have always been a bit of a tomboy, but I still enjoy dressing up on occasion. Marciano is one of my favorite places to shop for sexy yet still classy dresses for nights out. \n\nThis Marciano is located in Fashion Show Mall which I normally try to avoid due to the crowds. The service and selection at this Marciano location is why I am come here instead of going to the Town Square location. \n\nTammy in particular is a fabulous sales associate. She is able to recommend the perfect dress for the occasion, and all of the additional accessories without being pushy at all.
0;"I'm definitely not the type of person who likes to give merely 1 star... but after my experience here, it's hard to give it anything more.  The only thing going for it really was the view... too bad though that it was too dark to see the water.\n\nWe went here for my birthday dinner a few nights ago.  Walked in, nice decor, but were greeted by the smirk of a man who was looking down his nose at us - especially since we didn't have a reservation.  The place wasn't busy... maybe half full, if that.  We waited patiently for about 20 minutes to be seated.\n\nThe waitress was... somewhat polite; I mean, she did try to cater her suggestions to her audience.  I'm Japanese, but you know... just because I am doesn't mean that you need to suggest all the Asian dishes as specialties.  She did the same racial profiling to the table next to us of Italians.  While I understand her meaning behind it and I'm sure she didn't mean to be offensive, I just found it odd.  Unfortunately, she also didn't know anything at all about the wines, but I made a selection we enjoyed anyhow. \n\nWe ordered the calamari as the app and it came out cold.  I personally have never enjoyed cold fried items, but hey that's me.  I'm not all that sure how long it had been sitting in the window, but since it took about 30 minutes to arrive at the table I assume a while.  The whole night it felt as though our waitress was avoiding us since the calamari sat nearly untouched for at least 15 minutes until she came by with my friend's clam chowder soup.  The soup he said was good, but I found it slightly inexcusable that she kept walking past our table and looking at the untouched appetizer whilst she continued to service the table next to us to her fullest extent. For our entrees, he ordered shrimp 3 ways and I ordered a simple shrimp and crab pasta.  His was overcooked to the point of rubber and mine made me feel ill immediately after consumption.  We both decided to skip out on desserts due to the awful service and poor food quality.  \n\nOne thing that upsets me is when a restaurant ruins its ingredients and this one did.  Go for the soup and nothing else.  If you expect even a smidgen of decent service, don't even bother. It's over priced and pretentious for food that is improperly prepared.  Before exiting the establishment I had to excuse myself in order to \""go bulimic\"" and my friend felt incredibly sick the next day.  Stomachs beware!"
3;I love the quality, of course, but the staff was as nice as the pens.  John helped me the first time I went in and helped me with a pencil.  When I went back to trade it in (the pencil just wasn't a fit), Paula helped me and she was great.  We talked dogs.  Very nice.
0;Stayed there this pass memorial day weekend and was the worst time ever. For one I asked the front desk 2 weeks in advance if I could get a early check in and they said they would request it. I understood that there was no guarantee but I thought since I frequently stay there they would accommodate us. When we arrived they said that my room was not ready. Then we reserved a cabana down at the pool. I asked if it was still OK to invite 1-2 friends to visit and they said no and that they needed a wrist ban which I would have to pay an additional 50 bucks for. Lol I don't think so. Lastly as my family were walking around the property we were stopped by a security person who said that we couldn't tour the whole facility because there was a private party going on. I really didn't think that was fair because we were surely paying full price for the whole resort not just half of the resort. From my last experience I will NEVER go or recommend the Phoenician again. \n\nGood luck
4;OLD SCHOOL CC!! You feel like you step back in time at this club. Now everything is in pristine updated condition, but the club itself has that old time CC feel and swagger. The service is top notch and the attention to details is on point. I didn't see Ty Webb or Judge Smails here, but I'm sure this would be a place for them. Tennis courts are in perfect condition and the golf course is a PHX classic! So, just snake a tube down her nose and I'll be there in four or five hours. I am enjoying Phoenix CC!
4;This place is amazing. The service is top notch, they always have everything we are looking for (and more)! If you need it, they have it, and the prices are more than reasonable.
4;Roy and Bonnie P\nWow!!!   What a great place.  Alex is so friendly.  He listens, he asks questions and gets the job done right.  Our little Snuggles never looked better.  This place is so different from our previous groomer.  You must check this place out.
2;stayed here again cuz my friend got a free room.\n\nwhy the star drop?\n\nthis time our room was much smaller then last time, no window in the shower, no vanity area, and no huge couch it was just a simple room.\n\nwhen we got in the room the toilet was already broken and a guy had to come fix it which caused us to be even more late\n\ni realized i hate the casino area of the hotel it looks so dingy and gross\n\ntheir room service can kisss a hairy ass. seriously we got a clam chowder, diet coke, and chicken noodle soup for $20. seriously the soda was this tiny half bottle i shoulda ran downstairs and ordered it at the tables, and my chicken noodle soup was BEYOND salty i mean completely un-edible, plus the chicken was gross looking and the noodles were extra hard... i jsut gave up and ran downstairs to gamble.\n\nso i left my pillow here in the room but they found it and it was @ the security desk. he was being a dick, asking me what exact colors it was (omg its like the most fruity rainbow-colored thing around!!) plus he was acting like it was a gold bracelet not wantin to give it to me making me sign a slip takin all my info from my license...wtcrazy......\n\n& valet is the slowest crap EVER!\nRio ur....ALRIGHT
0;I dont like these place! Ppl are rude and mean! And take really bad care of customer service
4;Amazing place, exactly what you would expect from a Vegas pool party.
2;Industry is good, but not great. They have good food, good beer, good cocktails, and a good environment.  They are just good when they should be great.\n\nThe food is very hit and miss. Sometimes the dishes are over sauced, other times they are perfect.  My fries this time had way too much cheese. My sandwich was perfect. Last time my sandwich had way too much aoli.\n\nThe smoke stack cocktails are amazing. If you like smokey, they can't be beat.\n\nMy recommendation for Industry is to go early. The place gets way too loud way too quickly. They need sound dampening or something. I typically have to start shouting by 8pm.
4;Stopped in for lunch today and everything was good.  I had the blackened grouper tacos and my girlfriend had the shrimp tacos.  Both were excellent but I lean towards the grouper.  The spicy kick added with the salsa was awesome.  Even the small sides of beans and rice were good.  Very friendly staff, quick service and reasonable price for lunch.  Highly recommend this new downtown Gilbert addition.
4;Cake Nightclub has brought a new vibe to Scottsdale! Great vibes, beautiful people and amazing service that comes along with it. Nothing expected, always something new :) highly recommended !
0;No stars for this business..Dropped off a dress for alteration on a Saturday with a promise to complete on Thursday. Showed up to pick up dress on Friday morning and not done. No apology and not even an excuse. If I didn't have a party in Friday I would have taken unaltered dress and left. Done last minute with a lot of stress. Will not return to this business. Not reliable.
4;OMGthis pizza is the bomb that's all i gotta say!
2;All i remember is that it was a good time, minus girls having to pay cover charge boooo.
3;I enjoyed the salad I had here, though I feel their prices are a bit high. There was a mixup with food, however, and it was given to someone else the first time it was ready, leaving me without food for 20 minutes. This normally would lead me to write a bad review, but the waiter who brought my food out apologized politely and even have me a refund for it.
2;Have eaten here many times over the years while visiting my Grandma. Can't remember ever having a bad meal... \n\nFood is good, and prices are very reasonable. Staff is friendly and always coming around to refill water/tea. They are very knowledgeable about the food, if you need a recommendation, just ask. If you are in the area, swing by and enjoy some very savory Chinese food! \n\nOrder the Sesame Chicken!
1;"And the adventure begins to P.F.Changs.......\n\nOn this adventure, we carefully chose our 2:45pm time slot, Just after the church crowd, and just before the early birds who retire early for the evening. \n\nThe number of guest in the restaurant were few, although we did notice a few smaller groups in the right side of the dining area, the left side was quite empty.  The view from the entrance allows you to view the kitchen, and it was bustling with food, and servers appeared to be quite busy moving the food out of the kitchen window.  We did witness a first hand accident which occurred at the kitchen doorway, which resulted in a loss of a few meals and dishes......I guess someone else in the restaurant was also on an adventure. I would refer to this as a detour or unscheduled event.\n\nAfter approximately five minutes we were seated in the far left of the restaurant, just a few tables over from a party of thirteen.  This is where the adventure begins.......I will have a few rules of visiting restaurants at the end of this review.....\n\nWe were approached by our server, whom I will name \""K\"", she was very helpful at first, but that is where it ended.  On this occasion we had the Kung Pao Chicken and the Chicken Lo Mein, our drinks were sweet tea, and water.  Let me re-phrase that, our drinks were suppose to be sweet tea and water. Water, check, Sweet tea - negative Ghostrider.  This tea was un-sweet and there were no sweeteners in sight.  After a few minutes \""K\"" returned, we requested a few sweeteners, and this sufficed.\n\nOur meal came out in a timely fashion, approx 15-20 minutes.  The portion sizes were nice, just enough for possibly two people to share, or if you are like me, the size was just right for a good hearty meal.  I enjoyed the Kung Pao, it was fresh, hot in temperature, just a few scallions, just enough red hot chili peppers, and the chicken had a nice crisp yet gentle taste.  I would consider this a very good meal and for the food,  I give it 4 stars.  My wife's meal was also very good, the noodles were cooked very nicely, and if there were any complaints it was that the chicken was lacking in the lo mein.....again, the food for her meal 4 stars.\n\nNow the reason for the 2 star review.  The service.  Have you ever met someone and felt, \""Gee I really want to like this person, I want them to do very well, I want them to succeed, I want them to just do what it is that they do best\"", but in this case, I was neglected, my wife was neglected and to make matters worse, the table of thirteen near us, was receiving all of her attention.  I drink water at my meals, I drink ALOT of water, at this meal, I had ONE glass of water, no refills, no follow ups, and this water was empty well into the meal.\n\nI had to leave the last of my meal, because I did not have any water to wash down the white rice, which as one knows can be bland, if there is no water to help wash it down.\n\nSo here are the rules that should always be followed. ( I broke a few)\n1. If the restaurant is empty and you have to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated, leave.....leave quickly. (this is NOT a good sign)\n2. If you witness an accident involving 2 or more employees which result in dropped meals and drinks, resulting in broken dishes. Leave, leave quickly, that could be your meal next on the floor.  (this is not a good sign)\n3. If you are seated right next to a big party and your server is attending to them, you are delightfully screwed in your needs and this is truly not a good sign. ASK for a different server and section....\n4. If you can't motion your server over due to the fact that they are so focused on others, and you are unable to view them due to your poor seating arrangement. ( I may want to consider wearing a clown shirt)\n5. If your server apologizes to you AFTER the meal, then it may be just a little to late to receive a good tip. This is what I refer to as your OMG moment that you were dreading..... it's called ....the bad dining experience.\n\nSo to break this down:\n\nThe Pros: \n1 Good Food, (reasonably priced)\n2 Nice atmosphere, \n3. Beautiful statues of horses, \n4. Swinging door entrance, and \n5. Good location.\n\nThe Cons: \n1. Waiting for an empty table in an relatively empty restaurant. \n2. Mirrors reflected smudge marks on every mirror located in our dining area. \n3. Service, \n4. Service, \n5. And Service\n\nSo,  to sum up the dining experience it would have been a very strong 4 stars, but the service brought that down to a very strong 2 Stars. I will be back, but I will be assured that I will be in a different section, and insist on a different server.\n\n NCFoodGuy"
3;You know what they say.... location, location, location.  It's on the corner of an intersection within the strip mall so parking is hell and it's right next to the UPS store so that doesn't help either.  However, that's the only bad things.\n\nDo wish they had a drive-thru.\n\nThe younger girls that work there are usually bored but that's to be expected for a job like that.  They are attentive though and the clothes always comes back clean from their central warehouse area where they actually do the dry cleaning.  What's neat is that all your preferences, and information is stored from any Al Phillips so you don't have to tell them how you like your clothes done.  Realized this when the gal gave me a ticket after asking for my number.\n\nAnother neat thing is that they do have a mobile service.  Costs more but might need it at some point.  \n\nEight pieces cost about $38, which comes to a little under $5 a piece.  A little pricier than I've paid in other cities but as long as it's clean, and on-time, it's worth it.
3;"Not going to go into too much detail for a place with 1300 reviews.  Yelp is accurate.  Aria is indeed a 3.5 star establishment.  I look at it as an overall positive experience, so I rounded up.  It's clean, modern, sleek, but not sterile.  I would consider staying here again given a good rate.\n\nKeeping it to the point with a list:\n\n-- Love the smell.  No nasty cigarette odor here.\n-- For the quality of room, I got a steal at $400 for two nights in a King Suite and two tickets to a Cirque show.  Late check out was added to my package for no additional cost.\n-- Super fast North Valet.  North Valet is close to guest elevators but far from main desk.\n-- Super fast check in.  In and out in less than a few minutes.\n-- Complimentary wifi (decent speed).\n-- Rooms are excellent.  Furniture is modern, colors are warm, layout is classy.  Down feather bed with smooth cotton sheeting.  Equipped with numerous \""one touch\"" light settings, and automatic black out drapes.  \n\n-- Didn't think of everything though.  No iPod hook up.  Must use their TV for music and movies.  Sorta lame.\n-- As others have stated, extra tall shower and oval Roman tub share their own \""mega stall\"" behind glass doors.  The tub is just for soaking, no jets.  So sort of useless.  I'm too short and couldn't adjust the showerhead.  o_O\n-- Bath products are subpar at best.  Robes are thin.  No slippers.\n-- Location is off the Strip.  Don't be fooled.  Yes, it's about 20 min just to get to the Cosmopolitan.  It's 10 minutes by tram plus a 5 min walk to get to the Bellagio.  And it's 25 minutes to get to the Paris. I don't mind the walk, but don't want people to think this location is \""convenient\"" and close to anything.  It's not.\n-- Charges a resort fee of $25 a night + 12% tax on check out.\n\n__________\n\n-- Pools are spacious, non crowded, and clean.  Favorite: 32 oz dragonberry mojito.\n-- View Bar.  The best drinks I had in Vegas.  The signature cocktails are delicious.  Locals ask for Manny.  \""Best bartender in Vegas\"" apparently.\n-- Jean Phillippe Patisserie is a chain that's scattered around other Vegas hotels.  Nothing special.  No macarons, lame.  Except the large $4 raspberry macaron sandwich.  Yumyum."
4;BIG LEAGUE CLEANING IS AMAZING! They are extremely professional and completely help me with any last minute cleaning that I need. With me working full time and taking care of my 3 kids on my own its hard for me to get my house the way that I want it. Patty and her staff always come through and turn my house into a place that I want to come home to.\n \nI have used her services since before Christmas of 2012, her pricing is reasonable and her work is impeccable...she made my house look like it is kid and pet free. I totally will refer them over and over again and have used them at least once, twice sometimes even three times a month! Thanks Patty for all your hard work!
2;"I went back and had what they are best known for which is their Pho. In particular, I order the beef and ginger pho. \n\nThe broth was very flavorful and had the perfect amount of ginger.  I added extra noodle to mine. Be warned, extra really mean extra! Tons of noodles. Had a hard time finishing my soup because the portion sizes are very amazing for such a great price. The substance of the beef was a bit \""chewy\"". It's hard to explain. I think I would have enjoyed the soup better without any meat at all. \n\nService is OK but there is room for improvement. During the last visit, I paid with Visa, however, due to the internet and a few fax orders coming in during the same time I was about to pay, my BF and I ended up waiting a good 5 minutes for the machine to clear. It wasn't a big issue as we weren't in any big rush, but do be warned that this may cause you a delay in the future. Server apologized but it wasn't her fault. \n\nThat being said, Wah Kee is a place to go on a cold day when you want some good soup."
0;"I should have read the reviews!.... Food terrible; I ordered the burger sliders, and after 45 minutes I received them cold and hard, my husband ordered a bacon burgers and received a dry cold regular burger. Service; the worse here in Las Vegas- we waited for an hour because they told us the kitchen was backed up. After we were seated we waited another 45 to receive our food. Our waiter came twice in the 2 hours we were there. I needed some ranch and when I asked the server he told me to ask my waiter... I don't get why he couldn't just give it to Me. I'll never come back. I recommend u take your money somewhere else where u'll get good serivice"
1;I was extremely disappointed with this restaurant, not only with their food, but also with their service.  First of all, we waited for at least an hour before our food came out of the kitchen.  That was absolutely unacceptable for a restaurant as renowned as DB.  Secondly, their food was unbelievably mediocre.  I don't remember the name of the dish I ordered, but what I do remember is that it was a fish dish and the fish was dry, the broth/sauce was too salty, not to mention, the portion was ridiculously tiny.  \n\nEven though I was not impressed with their food, I enjoyed their bread a lot, especially their fig bread.  \n\nI expected more from this restaurant and this place had definitely failed to live up to its reputation.
0;"I have dubbed this place Stinky Sushi.  This place is fine for drinks and the patio is great.  But don't go expecting good food.  \n\nI should have known that the sushi was not going to be worth eating because our waitress had no information about recommendations from the sushi bar and did not offer to find anything out for us.  She seemed to be clueless about the menu. I asked her to find out what the sushi chef recommended and she had no useful information to give us.  \n\nThe yellowtail nigiri was disgusting.  It looked grayish and was dry, sort of like a rubber eraser.   The rice on the California roll was hard and dry and tasted like the roll had been made the day before and refrigerated until right before it was served.  \n\nWe had a few other rolls and they were ok...nothing special. The seared hamachi and the raw hamachi \""specialties\"" were ok but we could taste the poor quality of the fish even though it was covered by other ingredients (ponzu, jalapenos, etc.). The tempura was average. The edamame was average. The seaweed salad was mostly julienned cucumbers and microgreens, and didn't contain much seaweed.   \n\nI would love to see some improvement in the food, as I would like nothing better than to have a good Japanese restaurant in the neighborhood.  But I've been to the other location in Old Town and the quality of the food is similar, so I am not holding my breath.   I'd have drinks at Stinky (I mean Stingray) and then go to True Food for a truly high-quality meal (and there is a great raw fish dish on their menu)."
0;I find it astonishing there are so many good reviews about this school because It's been an absolute nightmare from beginning to end, There is zero communication between parents and teachers, You call and leave a message for a teacher and receive no call back. It's near impossible to get a message through at all, I don't know if the messaging service on the EKA website is flawed or the staff and teacher's just don't care but I've attempted on several occasions to contact my 2nd graders teachers and received no response. I've written letters, same thing. I'm just so frustrated I can't believe their able to be run this way. \n\nI would strongly discourage any parents looking into this school to steer clear and look elsewhere if you care about being involved in your child's education at all. Some of us parents still believe in being hands on parents. You're not going to be able to be that here.
4;"Still a great place to bring your guns / rifles to practice, practice and more practice. Make sure to bring proper eye and hearing protection as this will also save you money. Lanes are cheap. Plenty of range officers are on duty ; ) They keep everyone safe. This is especially important when there is a first time shooter on the range with no formal weapons training. Don't complain about the temp on the lanes either. Some are cool. Some are warm. There is plenty of ventilation to suck out the particulates. You are there to practice and train. Not to be comfortable."
1;This could quite possibly be one of the hardest reviews I have ever had to write, then again, I don't write very many reviews. My main reason for doing so is in hopes that Began will take this information and apply it for the good. \n\nI have loved C.I.P. since the old location. We went as often as we could to enjoy great pizza and an always changing and delightful wine list. I think a lot has changed since the old place, even before it closed we noticed things beginning to sour.\n\nAgain, I had high hopes for the new location. Finally, something good in Southern Tempe! With those words I will say, it's probably one of the best places to eat in the neighborhood. Considering the competition, that's no major feat. For some bizarre reason this area is plagued with mediocre eateries and sub par cuisine. C.I.P. is just a part of that race now.\n\nThe wine list is delightful. I will get that out of the way. He has always taken pride in his wine choices, and that still shines. \n\nThe service is great! Some familiar faces from the last place, and some new ones. Everybody was attentive and charming.\n\nThe food is nothing to cheer about. I have been for lunch and dinner. Both times I have seriously been let down. Maybe my expectations were too high, but considering the quality of food that came out of the other kitchen 2 years ago, I think my expectations are justified. I say 2 years because that is about when we saw C.I.P. starting to lose it's grip. \n\nThe crust is nothing like the crust used to be. You once could taste the effort, the love and patience that went into making it every day. That is just gone. This directly affects the bread appetizer as well. The Aglio Olio is completely different now. It used to be bright and clear with minced jalepeno's. I could drink that stuff! Now it's dark with sliced jalepeno's. Just not the same thing. The pizza was flawed by the dough from the first bite. The ingredients seem like the same stuff you can get from a major grocer. It lacked freshness and punch.\n\nWe had the asparagus and prosciutto app for lunch today. Again, store bought veggies and the prosciutto seemed lower level. Considering the portion size, I expected more. My sandwich had no flavor, yet was thankfully crisp unlike the pie. Worst of all, the side of chips was a bowl of regular Lay's style potato chips. I have worked for a chef who would only fry her own chips, in any situation. It makes all the difference in the world. That sort of little detail. And for the price you pay at C.I.P, those little details should be everywhere.\n\nMaybe I'm a dick, or a food snob. Maybe. But I know good food, and I know what Began is capable of. I've loved it. I've spent days anticipating a visit to his restaurant so I could sit down and enjoy myself beyond belief.  Those were the days when you walked in and he was covered in flour, sweating, hair messed with a smile on his face welcoming you to sit down and enjoy his creations. He has since cleaned up a bit, and good for him. I wish C.I.P. nothing but the best.\n\nAgain, one of the hardest reviews I have ever had to write...\n\n...but I gotta call it like I see it. If it ain't broke. Don't fix it.
4;Amy and her staff are fantastic to their customers and their owners. This is a locally owned business and that is another reason I take my Maltese to them. I love supporting small business owners!
0;I rented a Porsche with a friend of mine for a fun drive to the Grand Canyon, part of a grand bachelor party scheme to surprise a close friend. We told the woman at the rental place that we were going on a 500 mile round trip, and she was nice enough to recommend we pre-purchase the extra miles. This was to be the last notion of good customer service I was to receive.\n\nThey gave us a car that had seen a few rough rides in its day, but seemed good enough apart from a few dings here and there. The attendant pointed out the tire warning light but excused it, saying it was broken. We were in a hurry to get going (a long trip to make in a day), so we grabbed the keys and were on our way.\n\nAbout 2 hours outside of town, we stopped for gas, and the attendant pointed out that there was a 2 inch crack in the tire, and a number of points where the rubber was peeling away. Up on the lift, we could see better that the tires were over 5 years old and were all nearly bald. Scared to keep on driving in this deathtrap out into the unpopulated wilds near the canyon with what were clearly a set of crap tires, we called Dream Car to complain. We ended up waiting 2.5 hours in cafe waiting for them to drive out a replacement car -- a downgrade to a BMW Z4 (a fine car, but no Porsche). Our plan to surprise our friend at the canyon had to be scrapped, but we were glad we could at least continue our journey to intercept them without having to spend the night at a motel in the middle of nowhere. When our replacement car arrived, we were surprised to see that it was a manual transmission (no mention had been made of this on the phone). LUCKILY, I can drive stick, but my friend was out of luck. So much for a fun drive together.\n\nSo... long story short: Our carefully laid plan was ruined (never did get to see the grand canyon), we spent a day of our vacation driving to a random spot in Arizona, we had to downgrade to a car I wasn't all that excited about driving (but still had to pay a ton for), and my friend couldn't drive the car at all. When we got back to the rental place, all they offered as recompense was to take off the charge for the extra miles and NOT CHARGE US TO REPLACE THE TIRES! Five-year-old tires that were clearly ruined long before we drove a very un-wild 120 miles on them. Not cool, DreamCar... not cool.\n\nPlaces like this will run a car into the ground until some poor schmo pays a bunch of money to get stuck holding the bag when his car gets a flat, breaks down (or worse!). Can you imagine having to pay for a replacement part on a Lamborghini? How are you supposed to know if your exotic foreign car is in good mechanical standing? Isn't that what the rental place is supposed to ensure? Surely a place charging hundreds of dollars a day for a rental can afford to keep the cars in good shape?\n\nSending people out in a sportscar with faulty tires for a 500 mile drive into the desert isn't just immoral, it's totally dangerous. I warn everyone here thinking of renting from Dream Car to go elsewhere, or at least inspect your car very thoroughly -- because I don't think you can count on Dream Car to inspect it for you.
1;"I'm putting my newest update at the top for a change.  C4..is...UGH!  I've never been so frustrated with a place before in my life.  Nor have I ever given so many chances to a place before in my life.  Why do I do it?  Maybe because I think it has potential?  But I'm down to the last chance.  I'm giving the roof deck (yet) another shot when it reopens and thats it.\n\nMy most recent experience here was for the UYE.  Of course there were tables that were missing chairs.  I'm used to that.  (On a previous trip the little leather chairs were at regular sized tables and I literally fell into one)  We managed to snag a couch seat after a bit and of course the glasses the people before us left behind were never bussed off the table.  (This has happened to be me several times at C4)  My friend ordered the Yelparita, while $1 for a pint is great, its just basically tequila and sour mix.  She gave the bartender a $20, he didn't have change, and in fact did not get her change for another 2 HOURS!  We actually would have left sooner if the bartender didn't disappear for 20 minutes and we were waiting for the change.  (Seriously, we were the only people in the bar area)\n\nHungry (it was 5:30) and wanting to try the appetizers and the new summer menu we grabbed some menus.  (Because nobody offered them to us  I took it upon myself to grab a few)  We sat there FOR AN HOUR with the menus and nobody cared to ask us if we wanted anything.  Do they not serve food in the bar?  If so could someone have mentioned that?  It was ridiculous. Finally we just left because we were absolutely starving.  \n\nI have always felt that C4 was hit or miss.  And I realized last night that the few times it was \""hit\"" wasn't because it was fantastic of the food was stellar...it was just because nothing went wrong!  I was at the pool one afternoon, and while the music was loud and annoying, we were at least served and had a fun time.  Best time ever? No.  Would I go back to hang by the pool?  Probably not.  Dinner on Valentines Day was just ok....nobody was served in the wrong glass and no entrees were dropped but the food was just average.  I can't give stars based on good experiences being the kind of experiences where things don't go wrong.  \n\nOriginal Review:\nI hit up C4 for the Yelp event and I did enjoy myself....however this was after about 4 drinks at FEZ.  \n\nIts not really your typical hotel lounge, its more of a bar.  (Even in comparison to other boutique hotel lounges, like the Charlesmark in Boston, I have to say it doesn't give you that relaxed hotel lounge feeling.)   It stands in stark contrast to other places I've been to downtown such as Roosevelt and Lost Leaf.    I hate to say it but I felt like it was generic trendy...almost amateur.  (The paint job was shoddy and the ladies room was pretty atrocious.  I remarked to my husband that it reminded me of the bathroom at his fraternity house.  Not a good thing). I didn't sample any of the apps, although they looked great and I know *some* people were very excited about the vegetarian options.  ;)  The Asian pear martini was delicious though.  Delicious and dangerous.  I did order one Vodka/Red Bull and the bartender tried to psyche me out telling me it was $22.  Oh, and they should also try to secure their Pokemon paintings to the wall better.  \n\nI don't know.  For me it has a bit of an identity crisis.  Not quite a hotel lounge, not a dive bar, not quite a trendy spot.  What are you C4?!\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nI hate when I have to update a place and take away a star.  I really do.  But I have no choice in this case and I think I'm being generous only taking away one star and not two.\n\nMy recent experience here was horrible.  The service was awful, my drink took forever to come out (despite the fact the place was less than half full) and the food was just plain bad.  My chicken was sliced incredibly thin and somehow the noddles I ordered instead of rice never made it to the plate.  The sushi was no better than what you would get at Costco."
4;I am recommending Water heater pros to anyone who has problems with there tank...Shane the service guy was very informative about the warranty,,and service. Installation took about an hour...would've been less but I did ask a lot of questions on tips on how to up keep with the maintenance of the water heater...
4;Love this place! I still kinda like the one on Central slightly better, but this has a cool inside/outside vibe and being next to LGO is awwesome!
1;I wish i could actually give this place a better review. Food was good, but not great enough to have such bad service. It may very likely be the night I went, but no one seemed to apologize for long waits and missing our reservation for over 2 hours. Bar gets 5 starts though. Great wine by the glass list.
0;"I am originally from Charlotte, and was back in town visiting family and friends and a friend of mine suggested meeting here for tapas and drinks this evening.  I could not wait to write this review.\n\nI have not encountered such poor customer service in a very long time, and that's saying something, as I currently live in New York City.  The hostess who \""greeted\"" me was incredibly rude.  I use the word \""greeted\"" very freely.  Basically, she looked me up and down expectantly as I walked in the door.  When I said nothing, obviously expecting a \""Hello\"" or a \""Welcome\"", she proceeded to sigh and grunt out a \""How many?\""  When I explained to her that I was meeting someone and pulled out my phone to text my friend to ask her if she wanted to sit inside or out, I was told, very rudely and abruptly, that the restaurant was \""obviously very small\"" and that she would not seat me  until my party was complete.  Fine.  I understand that many restaurants have this policy.  I was making no complaint.  There's no need for such an attitude.\n\nA bit taken aback by her demeanor, I asked if I could wait at the bar, towards which I was waved with a scowl.  When my friend finally arrived, I tried to settle up with the bartender (for a single seltzer), and he said it was no problem and not to worry about it.  When we approached the hostess to claim a table, she looked at me very accusingly and said, \""Well did you settle your bar tab?\""  \n\nI've worked retail, I've worked food service - I know people have bad days, I know these jobs can really suck sometimes, but there is no excuse for attitude like that.  Especially when I did nothing to provoke it.\n\nThe waitress was competent, but not particularly friendly or helpful in the slightest.\n\nFood was fine, nothing incredible.  And the red velvet cupcake was dry and infinitely forgettable.\n\nI think the management and staff here should seriously rethink their approach to customer service.  Treat your customers well - they're the one and only reason that you're in business.\n\nI will never, EVER come back here.  And I will never recommend this establishment to anyone."
1;Rude, snobby and way over priced they run this place like a cruise ship & encourage you to charge away. Not large family friendly and very poorly managed, beware at sign up our understanding was not honored and so we chose to take our business elsewhere.
0;"My visit was on 6/12/14:\n\nI'm appropriately titling this review: \""Barista Bull S**t\""\n\nI always wondered why it took this location so long to be accessible on Yelp.com; maybe because they knew what kind of reviews they would get?  usually, I get my drink on the weekends with no hassle or fuss; however, on some occasions I do experience oddities; like this one:\n\n-My father and I have been coming to this location for well over a year, my dad almost on a daily basis and usually at the same time everyday.  Do you think they would learn his or my name, what drinks we get.....nope!  My wife gets treated totally different by the Manager and staff when she goes in for coffee; why aren't we?\nThe manager spends most of the time gossiping among her cronies, all except one of which is a man.  \n\nThis is one example of the nonsense that goes on behind the counter:\n\n**** A fairly butch-looking staff member argued with me about whether the green tea they offered was pure green tea; she exclaimed Yes, it's pure green tea!  (This was before Starbucks offered China Green Tip Tea)  She was referring to a green tea blend with peppermint and other flavors......in no way shape or form is this PURE GREEN TEA!!!  \n**** She ended up giving me \""what she thought was pure green tea\""....it wasn't. and I was really pissed at the fact that she argued with me, insisted she knew what she was talking about, and eventually was proven incorrect.  I told her I was recently at a Starbucks in China where they offered pure green tea; she said that's not possible.  I've noticed the staff (ladies) are only friendly to a select few customers; however, I believe it all stems from what the manager allows, and she seems to happily support this behavior.  \n\nOn another note:  The new furniture is very uncomfortable when compared to their previous lounge-type furniture.\n\n***By the looks of the previous reviews, I would say they're spot on and that this location has some \""personal\"" improvements to make to improve customer service and consistency regarding their products."
4;Breakfast all day, huge menu, big bar, live music. Food is really good, well priced. Open 24/7 right on Mill Ave. This place is going to make a killing. Go check it out!
1;"Just a disaster. \n\nWe walked in on a Friday afternoon to make reservations. They told me that for a party of 2, as in only 2 people, the only open reservations they had was for 6:00PM and 9:00PM. I Asked if they had a 5:00PM slot, and they said no. We were excited that it seemed so packed (so it must be popular!) and picked the 6:00PM slot.\n\nShowing up at 6:00PM on a Saturday, we found the place to be a complete ghost town. We were literally the ONLY people in the restaurant. No, I'm not saying \""Yea there were a couple of other tables filled but it was overall pretty empty\"". I'm saying \""There was not another seated table in the entire restaurant except for us.\"" Clearly not as popular as they thought they were in their heads (but their ego only expands from there).\n\nThe ambiance is beautiful, and the restaurant itself is presented quite well. Kudos to the construction and design crew. The design however is where the favorable parts about this restaurant end. \n\nOur waiter was decent. He knew most of the menu, was able to give us a basic description of the wine (though flubbed on telling us the location of most of them). No personal stuff, no chit chat. There was a very clear line between who he was (somebody there to make us pay for a service) versus who he wasn't (there to help us enjoy our meal to the fullest). \n\nThe food is ridiculously overpriced. Their cheapest entree's are around $30 and for a decent steak expect to pay upwards of $60+. That's for a SINGLE ENTREE. Want a side with that? Expect to pay $6 each for watery mashed potatoes or soggy asparagus. I was incredibly underwhelmed by the food. In no way was this a $150 dinner for two. I could have gotten a better meal down at the square for a third of the cost, easily. \n\nIt seems that the Statehouse thinks that it is the only classy and decent food serving place in all of Madison, and can thus charge you an arm and a leg for a basic meal. NEWSFLASH: THIS IS MADISON! This place is a foodie's dream and far far better food exists just a block or two away. Save yourself the massive pocket book write-off and go to a place where you will actually get quality food.\n\nOverall, I felt like the entire time the Statehouse was attempting to tell me that it was better than me. If this place was decently priced, I might actually return and recommend it just based off of it's ambiance and location. The adequate service and overpriced food forces me to not recommend this restaurant to anyone except those who wish to waste their money."
3;I have been here twice and I am impressed. The salads here are amazing, and I love the atmosphere (especially the mango vinaigrette dressing), as it is very funky and bright. This looks like a great place for happy hour. I have eaten on the patio, and that is very nice too with lots of shade. I also had the chicken tortilla soup which was great with an avocado slice in there and a small drop of sour cream. It had a nice kick of spice! The prices are great and portions are hefty!
1;Convenience of delivery, but mediocrity in quality. Why won't they put yellow mustard on for me? Okay, give me the packets, but this is now the third time that they forgot to include the packets. Thanks for cutting my sandwich in two, but why is one slice of bread broken into three pieces?
4;They have quite possibly the best sandwiches in America and it was well worth the hype. Had seen them featured on Food Network and was looking forward to my first visit and they didn't disappoint!!
4;This elegant, long-standing restaurant is housed in a 200 year old stable by the waterfront in Old Montreal. I've only been here on rare occasion, for special celebrations, and the last time was over 30 years ago. I brought my daughters here tonight so they can experience one of the city's finer establishments. And I was so glad at it was just as I remembered it to be: gentile and refined with a sense of tradition and history the moment you walk in.\n\nFirst, how wonderful that they offer free valet parking. I made it known that we were just coming in for desserts and coffee, and they were still happy to park my car for me (note: as many may know, parking is a royal pain in the patootie on a busy Friday night at 8pm in the summer! And nearby lots cost $15 to park in them). \n\nWe were told they could seat is in 30 minutes, so we strolled the old port and Place Jacques Cartier Square, marveling in the business and vibrancy of this great city. Upon returning to the restaurant, we were immediately seated. Tables clothed in white linens, leather-bound dessert menus at our seats. The waitresses were all dressed in period uniforms from the last century. \n\nOh, and the food was divine! My youngest had the epitome of a chocoholic's fantasy: the Chocolate Delight,which was a decadent chocolate mousse-like cake with a crunchy chocolate topping, plated on a gorgeous swirled sauce. She said it was the best dessert she ever had. Meanwhile, my other kid and I shared the Crepe Cerise Jubilee: a thin, delicate crepe with vanilla ice cream with lots of cherries (and some blueberries). This was, hands down, the best dessert I've ever had. Ever. I was in heaven. \n\nMy cappuccino was too strong for me, but my daughters enjoyed their French teas. And how lovely, to get some dark mint chocolate medallions on our table as a complimentary treat. Very lovely gesture.
3;always good!!!\nportions are huge. my friend order a cobb salad and it was enormous. i had a delicious turkey sandwich... it is definitely a spot to go when you get sick of the buffets.
4;Jeremy is a great resource for all your insurance needs. He helped me sign up for health insurance and educated me on how I was under insured with my vehicle.  The office environment is friendly with snacks and drinks to enjoy while you wait . Caralyn was very helpful in getting everything finalized with my old insurer. I highly recommend All Kinds of Insurance. They are a great team!
1;"Sunday Diner's Beware! Tonight they were out of all pasta products, including the Mac & Cheese I was craving. I decided to get soup, however they were also out of rolls. Also, they were out of their Mango Tea. Their excuse for being out of everything I ask for? \""We're normally out of almost everything on Sunday's.\"" If this is something that happens every Sunday then whomever orders should be smart enough to plan for it."
1;"Biblos, as Ian A so rightly points out, is the kind of place you walk past a bajillion times before you actually realise you should probably check it out. I walked past it on a twice daily basis for the best part of a year (I was going somewhere, I should add - I wasn't just walking past to gaze in longingly) and now, long after I stopped walking past it, the opportunity arose as we hunted a post-show drink. Watching ice-dancing is enthralling but also you leave the performance feeling like you've been holding your breath for two hours straight and now seriously need to relax.\n\nSo we sauntered to the nearby Biblos. What to say, what to say. There was a sign on the wall saying that the upstairs space was reserved, but on asking it apparently wasn't, so we went up. It has a nice interior and I was very comfortable, and I even actually took my actual coat off. Yes, the Lizard Woman was warm enough!\n\nBut on the down side, it took a long time for anyone to come and take our order (oh he came around to gather up and whisk away the food menus, and when we said \""we would like to order some drinks\"" he just waved the menus at us as though to say \""Not my division. I'm on gathering duty right now.\""\n\nWhen we did order, it took a fair while to come. Now then, there were really not that many of us - seven if I recall correctly - and most of the upstairs was empty, so why it should take so long to concoct our round (which included a lime and soda and a diet Coke; not the most challenging) is a mystery. The arrival itself was also slightly confused and flustered.\n\nNevertheless, it's well located and comfortable, so it's far from being a write off. Ditch the TV (look, I love the IT Crowd, but seriously, what is the point of showing a sitcom with no sound? Football, yes, snooker, fine, but something that relies on dialogue?), whip up the service a bit, and they could have a real winner here. I worry that the good location excuses a little laziness; not for me it doesn't."
3;Waldo's is a place you have to try if you are in the Mesa/Gilbert area.  The setting has a kitchy somewhat campy theme inside and out.  It's kind of like a Route 66 diner but much better. The ceiling is painted with clouds and the restaurant is very open.  I think they might even have a back room also.  \n\nYour choices on BBQ are plentiful and the endless sides are a total bonus, even though buy the time you're done with your dinner, ordering more on the sides doesn't usually happen for me.   \n\nLast time I was there I got the pulled chicken.  What is mouth watering is the sauce they used.  They put it in a little skillet and you can use as little or as much as you like.  The tanginess of the sauce with a little bit is just what you want from a BBQ.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it. \n\nThe service every time we come to Waldo's has been excellent.  You can't beat the value and service.  Every time I am here, I always say I wonder why this place hasn't been on Diners, Drive-In's & Dives.
4;Our wedding cake/ cupcakes were AMAZING!  The flavors were perfect! It looked exactly like the website photos and the customer service was great! Highly recommend them for special occasions!
0;don't go here. why would you? it makes your body feel like it's been hit by a dumptruck, la fiesta will make you run to la bathroom. don't. don't. don't. (especially combo #8)
0;"Complalnt: Scam pricing, Inconsistent pricing between store and website, not so knowledgeable staff\n\n\nI have been looking for an in helmet blue tooth headset mostly for listening to music and being able to ask for directions without having to mount the phone and push buttons while I am riding. I had spoken to somebody there a couple of months ago and told that this unit, the HBC100 would do the job.\n\nI bought it yesterday because it was on sale. I got home and was surprised that it had been mislabeled and it was actually a dual headset system. I also found out that it was a system that had apparently been used as there was no manual or the tool that is supposed to be included and the operating modules had a full charge on them.\n\nI also found out that this model had been discontinued and Cycle Gear had it \""marked down\"" to the retail price everywhere else. This unit was priced the same as the more recent version, the HBC100 PLUS, on their website but the manager wanted to charge me more for the exchange because the store prices are different that their website.\n\nI was also informed that to get the VOX technology to operate my phone totally hands free I would have to upgrade to a unit almost three times as much.\n\nVery shoddy sales practices left me feeling like I could not trust them to take care of my business so I took my refund and left."
3;love it!!!! sat out side ,misters going strong ,very comfy setting, great menu and delicious food good service as well
3;"Teeming masses of hungry foodies have overrun Chelsea's original location, making the parking situation difficult but not impossible...you'll need to be somewhat creative.\nThe problem, as I like to define it is this:\nThe lure of a fine meal, fast service and reasonable prices simply won't dispel the shame associated with blowing a valet. \n\nHello Chelsea's Airport.\nA mere five miles from the original located in Terminal 4, this location is never crowded and, if you're in a hurry, they offer a Chelsea's Express window adjacent to the entrance.\n\nOn my most recent visit, the rotisserie prime rib was in order. Fortunately, they had an end cut available, making the experience even more enjoyable.\nThe sides were equally delicious. Blanched, cold green beans in a light lemon vinaigrette along with a DD-cup of garlic mashed potatoes. Nom. Nom. Nom. \n\nOh, and the parking is ample, Sky Harbor Terminal 4 charging only four dollars per hour.\nFour bucks! That's it. \nA lot less messy too. \n\nAny bets on how long it takes for YelpHQ to remove this one?\nI've never made their ROTD award, but I do routinely win their other ROTD award.\n\""Removal of the Day.\"""
4;"Can you say HANGRY?!! Except it was more like inner white girl needing copious amounts of carbs to soak up all the drinks we downed hours before! \n\nMy friend and I were so drunk; almost felt like this place was a mirage except when we clutched the wall, IT WAS REAL! We did the drunk girl excitement and raised our hands to the Italian Gods for creating pizza dough! \n\nBefore the waitress said anything, she knew we needed a reservoir of H2O. We finally choose to go with the Back East Buffalo Pizza & devoured it in minutes! I'm not that big fan of thin crust because sometimes it's so thin you can't put any yummy toppings on their without falling off or the crust gets burnt, but this crust was to die for (and that's not the tequila talking)! Although the prices may seem high, it's Vegas!! I rather pay more money for quality than have a free nasty meal! \n\nA good side effect of a thin crust pizza is it's enough to soak up the alcohol, but doesn't make you feel all bloated and nasty and lethargic, so you can still get into your skank dress and not feel like a sausage!"
4;"PBLT - pastrami belly on a BLT. Even better than it sounds; the arugula complements the fatty meat well. And the bread (thick cut) is excellent."
3;Really 4.5.  This place is AWESOME!  I paid for a deep tissue massage which gave me access to the gym and spas all day long.  My friend and I headed over a couple hours before our scheduled massage.  We briefly went to the gym (which was ok... didn't blow me away), and then headed in to the spa.  The roman baths and various steam rooms were awesome, as was the whirlpool.  I also loved the sitting area and the food and drinks available.  Fresh lemon water, healthy snacks, tea service... I got hydrated really quickly after a slightly wild night on the town.  \n\nThe massage I got was great too.  I got a male masseuse... it was slightly weird because I was naked under my towel, but he was totally professional about it and I never once felt awkward while the massage was going on.  The massage itself was great.  I was a little scared after requesting a deep tissue, but the firmness was just right without being painful.\n\nThe spa is clothing optional, but I would say 90% of the women had a bathing suit on.  My friend and I felt a little weird going buck naked at first, but quickly got used to it.  Either way, I was pretty surprised by the lack of nudity.\n\nMy one complaint is that the spa was packed.  It was relaxing anyway, but it was louder than a lot of spas I've been to and there were a lot of women using everything.
1;Jusqu'ici je n'\u00e9tais jamais entr\u00e9e dans la boutique et ce pour une raison simple : les mannequins dans la vitrine me faisaient peur! Or en entrant aujourd'hui, la vendeuse m'accueille avec un joyeux : \u00ab Alors, on a \u00e9t\u00e9 attir\u00e9e par la belle vitrine, hein?! \u00bb.... Petit moment de silence embarrassant, sourire g\u00ean\u00e9... \nVoil\u00e0 pour la petite anecdote. Ensuite la tr\u00e8s bavarde vendeuse m'a expliqu\u00e9 qu'ils \u00e9taient d\u00e9positaire d'une dizaine de cr\u00e9ateurs qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois et que l'une des marques, Aime comme Moi, \u00e9tait la leur. Pour ma part je n'ai rien trouv\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 mon go\u00fbt. Ni \u00e0 mon budget d'ailleurs. Finalement les mannequins dans la vitrine \u00e9taient un bon avertissement!
3;"I love this place-food is wonderful, however..........tonight my hubby&I sat in on a seminar by Stuart Spivak on financial planning and one of the servers \""rubbed me the wrong way\"". Idk maybe he was trying to be cute or funny but someone at our table asked what the salad dressing was for the wedge and he says \"" uh blue cheese?\"" in a question kind of  way as if \""duhh\"" - then when my hubby asked for Italian instead of his \""blue cheese\"" he said in a sing songy kind of way, \""oooookkkkkaaayy\"" as if we were being too particular. This guy was about 40 I guess, short, with glasses. It seemed like he had been employed longer and knew the ropes more than the gal (Charity) or the Spanish guy. Did not care for his attitude at all! It was almost as if he thought we were getting a free meal why should we get it exactly like we want??!! Charity (I asked her name)/ on the other hand was most gracious, most of the time \""silent service\"" was very professional. She went to get us go-boxes for what we couldn't eat, kept our water&tea glasses full, and gave NO attitude at all! Didn't expect to need any cash for tonight! Otherwise I would have tipped her!!! not him-the food WAS fabulous! The surf and turf was served and I had the double chicken breast. The brulee for dessert was wonderful too! However, when we speak to Stuart again we may comment on this experience."
4;Five dollar off coupons are all over the place - your yelp offer, also in magazines and newspapers and since the manager admitted that the home office screwed up, you can use these coupons at Happy Hour. So, the $7.50 all-american burger at HH becomes a real bargain at that point. It is a very solid burger as well, this one has no bells and whistles, just cheese and lettuce, etc. It would only be at the $10 price point when they start to get fancier and more creative. The buns here are quite fresh, the burger is a pretty good size at 1/2 pound and they cooked it right on the first try. I ordered the chips and those were crunchy and several were double-folded, which is a good thing. This location became 100% dead at 8pm and i had the bar to myself. The outside part of the bar though was poorly designed to watch TV as you can see all the screens on the far wall, but they are kinda far awy to concentrate on the games. Sit at inside bar to enjoy games. Friendly service and manager and quick service were also appreciated. I think I have tried tried half the stuff on this menu, mostly in Old Town, and they always get things right and tasty.
4;never, have i been to such a cute and quaint boutique!\n\nfirst impression:\nclean\nsimple\nFUN\norganized\ngreat energy\nfeels like your are entering a friends home.\n\nas soon as you walk in you are greeted with warm smiles. there is a sitting area right up front with magazines, a small childrens play area, h2o on tap and even a dog bowl. they even have a 'community board' which informs any guest who walks in about local up coming events, different instructors in the community, and background info about lululemon athletica.\n\nthe ladies who work this location are so sweet and always anxious to help with whatever they can. yes, it is a small store, but they do have some items i do not see in the bigger retail stores. \n\nmahalo, summerlin showroom! =)
0;I stayed  over the weekend and ended up leaving a bag in the room. Called lost and found as soon as i got back home. They sent someone up to the room to look and they called back and said they found it. Needless to say i was extremely happy to hear the news! I get a call back a couple hours later and the lost and found tells me that they have LOST MY BAG! Somewhere between the housekeeper finding my bag and it making it down to lost and found it was lost! Im sure the cash i had in a envelope and expensive camera i had in there had something to do with it not making it down ... I received a call saying that they made a mistake and never found my bag in the first place - im sure to avoid paying a claim!!! All they offered me was a complementary gift if i ever came back which was a slap in the face! I would be weary of going to this hotel because of their security issues! Oh and they had the room number to go and check, so how do you go to a particular room, find the missing bag and then say that they made a mistake??? That doesn't make sense!
0;Great views over Edinburgh castle but that's about it. I'm only here because it's late on a Sunday and raining outside. There are so many independent cafes in Edinburgh with better coffee, cake & atmosphere there should be no excuses for going to Starbucks
2;This is the closest Subway Sandwich Shop, to my house. \n\nThe shopping center is a bit difficult to get in and out of... Also navigating through the parking lot is quite difficult. \n\nIt's never too busy... Usually only 3 or 4 people ahead of you, at the most!\n\nThe dining room is very small. However, it's always clean. The men's bathroom is also always clean! \n\nThe service is always fast and friendly, and everything is always well stocked.\n\nIf you are in the area, I would recommend stopping in.
0;Worst chinese food ive ever had. Small portions and has no flavor. Not worth the $10.
3;First time here in July with my son and his father. The servers were not grouchy at all. Very helpful and patient in taking our orders, maybe because there was no line  but what the hey. I got double stamps for checking in. \nMy son ordered the vanilla shake while his dad the strawberry flavor. They liked their drinks well enough. I had iced green tea. It was a little watered down.\nThey have big comfy seats. Free use of board games and books. Clean restroom. \nAll in all a nice, cozy place to hang out without the noisy younger crowd at the other coffee shop.
0;My daughter and I went here for a show three years ago, and it was so awful that we still talk about just how terrible it was. It's our benchmark for how horrible a concert experience can be. \n\nIt was easily 90 degrees inside the venue, and that is a conservative estimate. There were several opening bands, so we thought we'd get some fresh air before the headliner. Nope. After PAYING for a reentry wristband, our choices were to stand in the alley by the front door and smell the dumpster, or move around the corner and smell the cigarette smoke of all the smokers who didn't want to smell the dumpster. We chose the smoke, only because there were benches over there. \n\nThe combination of the heat and the stench made my daughter sick, so she got to throw up in the filthy bathroom a couple of times. I tried to get her to leave but she had her heart set on seeing the band. Finally, 3+ hours after we got there, we got to see the band we went there to see. They were great, but I just couldn't enjoy it at that point. I was hot and tired, and feeling ill myself. I've never been so happy for a show to be over.\n\nAvoid this place like the plague. Like the clap. Like a Kardashian. Stay far, far away.
1;Great food, the service at this location is really bad :(\n\nI recommend the NE Phoenix location or delivery.
4;The best pizza in Little Italy and maybe even all of Montreal. If your visiting Montreal this is definitely a place you need to check out!
1;Not the worst utility company I've EVER worked with (eh-hum, SDGE), but definitely plenty of room for improvement.  Unfortunately there is little choice in the desert, which I also hate.  I don't think there should be a monopoly on who we get our water from.  Or electricity for that matter, we should have the freedom to choose, so that when a company DOES have this many bad reviews then we can simply avoid or change our service.  I don't like that they are open four days a week, that they require the deposits up front (every other service I've ever worked with will work with you, not just withhold service, seems wrong in the desert!), you MUST pay by credit or debit card....I guess I'm really cheesed because you're FORCED to do these things that may or may not fit into your plans.  If you can't do it, tough nuggies, no water for you.  I don't know, Americans are slowly getting their rights taken away one-by-one, I don't think it's right for a monopoly company to be able to do that with an essential resource.  Any suggestions on how we could combat this are welcome, I'd really like to do something about this,
4;"As unfortunate it is that it had to get to the point of needing a process server, I'm sure glad I found Superior Process Services. After having a horrible experience with another local company, that promised me they could serve my papers, only to tell me a few days later that \""they aren't what I'm looking for\"" and that I need to \""give them more time/information to serve my paperwork\"" (on time-sensitive material), and being extremely rude on the phone, I found Superior Process Services. \n\nThe process server, Tom, was absolutely exceptional and willing to serve early morning. He was extremely professional and honest, communicated with me very well and kept me \""in the know\"" with what was going on. I hired Tom, and within less than 12 hours, my documents were served. When he told me that my papers had been served, I couldn't believe it. Tom really knows his stuff, and it's clear that he's been in the business a long time. He's got process serving down to a science, and I VERY highly recommend Superior Process Services!"
3;Happy hour, Monday's. Eddie's house is the place to be. Actually Happy Hour everyday, except Monday, 1/2 price glass of wine. Always an experience at Eddie's House, especially if you sit at the chefs counter to watch all the action in the kitchen. You may even get a special treat. Great place.
1;"This will be a two part and two rating review.\n\nFirst, aside from the food, I have to say that the service was very friendly. The server  attended us well, and made several suggestions, and as Audrey S. said, the owner makes you feel welcome. That was very positive.\n\nNow a review of what we go out for, the food.\n\nWe decided to start out with a Spring Roll appetizer. The server recommended the Fresh Asian Roll instead. It was a good idea. It is nothing like the quality Spring Rolls you get at Pho So 1, or Pho Saigon 8, but it was light and refreshing. \n\nI am on a diet, so I ordered a Chicken Salad. The menu said it was fried chicken. I asked the server if I could have it grilled. She accomodated me. It was very fresh, and light for a summer meal, but it really wasn't very Asian. It was simply a Thin cut chicken breast, on top of a bed of Ice Berg Lettuce, with cucumbers and tomatoes on the side. Not much presentation. Fresh and good for a diet, but not what I expected from a Thai Chinese place. I did give it 3 stars.\n\nMy wife ordered the Wanton and Noodle Soup. The bowl was small, and only a few Wanton. There was a ton of noodles, but she said they were over cooked, and she didn't even finish half of the portion. Rating 1 star.\n\nTwo stars means \""I've experienced better\"", and this holds true for this place. If you are on a diet, go here for a clean salad. It's pricey for a small portion, but you'll feel better doing this, than pigging out at Sweet Tomatoes. \n\nHowever, if you're looking for good Thai or Chinese food, do your sense of eating adventure a favor, and go somewhere else."
2;It is nice to see such a large roller rink still around although there is a lot that can be improved here.  First the good.\n\nThe parties are reasonably priced.  The skates are in pretty good shape, the music is current and loud and the dj changes it up a bit so the skaters aren't always skating around with no goal. \n\nThe places for improvement - the parties are very disorganized and with the exception of food deliveries you are pretty much on your own.  I really would have liked to see a staff member available to give beginners a 10 minute group lesson as part of the party as several members of the party had no idea how to skate and ended up staying off the rink.\n\nAlso, they have no water at the counter except really wierd tasting tap water.  I don't care if you want to charge me 2 dollars for a small bottle of water, you should have something for people who do not want the sugary drinks.\n\nThe staff is very friendly when you speak with them although they seemed a bit disorganized.  \nThey do have wifi.\nStay away from the air hockey machine until it is fixed.
0;Just didn't have any fun here and I don't think I saw one person smiling the whole time I was here...bartenders included.
1;"Not Impressed. I was born and raised in Arizona, left about 10 years ago, and have recently returned. In the 10 years I have been gone, Scottsdale has gone through an explosion of commerce from big chain restaurants to little mom + pop shops and boutiques. I was eager to find some good coffee shops, so I hopped on Yelp and found this place ... boy was I disappointed. \n\nFrom the moment I walked into the shop and up to the counter I continually got the feeling that I wasn't welcome in the shop. I walked to the counter, and hung back a bet letting the customer behind me order, while I perused the chalk board menu (a nice touch). After deciding what I wanted to order, I stood in line and noticed the actual record player with a bunch of records representing the last few years indie/college hits (I also dug the record player putting out tunes). I stepped up to order and was not ever spoken too, I politely asked for my order, tipped a dollar, and was at least waiting for a smile or acknowledgement but received none. I then walked away from the counter assuming my order had been placed (I did receive change). \n\nI watched the female barista make my coffee, which she then simply placed on the service counter (again did not announce or gesture that it was my order). I had to assume it was mine because I was the only one waiting. I walked up the counter, asked if it was my order, to which the employee simply nodded her head. I had asked for my drink \""to stay/for here\"" but I was given a coffee in a to-go cup, normally I wouldn't even notice this type of mistake however, as per above, I got the feeling I wasn't welcome. \n\nI then sat down to try and do some studying and the moment I sat down and opened a book, the barista began to give me icy glares. I put in some head-phones to listen to a few video lectures and about a minute after I put on the headphones, the barista walked from around the counter and turned up the volume of the speaker system to an abnormally loud level. I noticed that the other 2 customers in the shop were also taken aback by the absurdly loud level of music. At this point I got the hint that I wasn't welcome in the shop, packed up my stuff and left.\n\nI should note I was the only non-white person in the shop, I don't know if it has anything to do with the attitude I was given, but considering the deference I was treated with it is either an unfortunate coincidence or this place really is intolerant of others.\n\n2 stars because despite all the shenanigans my latte was actually pretty good and was 3 dollars, which I thought was acceptable for the quality. Will not return because for 3 dollars there are numerous other places to get an equivalently good drink without the attitude."
0;Poor customer service! I typically recommend this place to all my friends when they are traveling through CLT, but I will not be doing that anymore. I rushed to stop by to grab a bite to eat before my next flight but when I arrived no one would acknowledge my presence. Finally when someone did at 7:53pm i was told by one of the wait staff that they were closed. Funny, I was able to walk from Concourse C to E in time to sit down and order at Fox Sports before 8pm when they closed. Needless to say, I will not return or recommend anymore.
2;I usually go here three or so times a week as I live 1/2 a mile away!\nI like their wine selection. Lots of cheap bottles, some good, some not so good. It's not as great as TJ's wine selection, but for how close they are I don't mind! \nTheir produce is kinda lacking. Their salads and lettuce and usually pretty soggy, and I no longer buy them because I'm afraid of getting e coli. Eek!\nTheir breads are decent, and their breakfast foods and desserts are pretty delicious, although totes unhealthy. \nTheir microwave single serve meals aren't the best, but if you're ever in a bind for time or need to feed a single 20 something guy they come in pretty handy!\nTheir selection of cold beverages are very nice, lots of juice and coconut water and energy drinks for a reasonable price.\nAll in all this store is pretty convenient for last minute grocery shopping, or to pick up an ingredient or two for dinner. \nThey could improve on their amount of employees at the check out. It is self checkout, but if you're buying booze they need to check our Id and enter it in, and there's been times where I've had to wait for a while, or track someone down to check it.\nEveryone that works here is super friendly tho! \nAnd everyone keeps saying that they are owned by Walmart?? But their website says their owned by Tesco. I don't know if Walmart owns Tesco? Either way I guess it doesn't really matter since Tesco is the Walmart of the UK anyway...
4;Vanity body sculpting is something everyone has to try.  I was not sure how it worked at first but Hannah was very good at explaining the process for me.  She set me up on the machine and made sure I was comfortable.  I love this process!  It really helped smoothe out the trouble spots I had on my stomach.  You can also watch movies while you're getting your treatment done!
1;VIP is a lie.\n\nWhen they say that you don't have to wait in line that is a complete lie. Sure the VIP line to get your ticket is smaller than the other line, but there is ANOTHER line that includes everyone. I saw people from the non VIP line get in before us because they were able to work through the crowd and shove ahead. That is not fair, I did not spend my money so that my friends and I could be shoved aside to wait even longer!! The night ended up being okay, and once we got in it was fine, but the place was slammed, too tiny. Dancing became more of a shuffle and try to move so people can pass through. And the drinks are so so so over priced! Be sure to drink ahead of time, 15-20 dollars a drink!! We went to see Common on NOV,11th....he played a whopping 3 songs, and didn't show up until almost 3a.m!!! Granted he was really good, it was way way way too short! I can say I had an experience, but I can also say that we won't be coming back.
2;If you are looking for the most amazing Pizza in Vegas you aren't going to find it here. However, this would be an awesome place to take your kid for lunch or dinner. Its a buffet style pizza place (if you can call it pizza) with an arcade and a little room to run around. The price is great $4.99 for lunch, are you kidding me? I would totally come back when I have friends in town and we are looking for a cheap, fun place to feed the kids and have a little grown up time while the kids play... but you won't find me here otherwise.
1;"Terrible happy hour sushi menu!\n\nAte here on the 20th after a long bout (at least a year?).  The same two chefs, Julio and Roberto, were still there, as well as Leo, the manager.  I re-informed them about my allergies and placed my order: spicy tuna ($4.50), spicy salmon ($4.50), and a soft-shelled crab roll ($7.95).  Julio prepared the first two, while Roberto prepared the crab.  I was fortunate enough to ask Roberto what he was going to substitute the * w/.  He said he could use radishes and yamagobo (pickled burdock; looks like julienned carrots).  Had I not said anything, I may have been disappointed w/ the crab roll as I was w/ the other two rolls... The tuna and salmon were pretty much just rice and the mashed fish filling.  I ate a few pcs. of each dish and gave up.  (Hey, I was hungry!!)  Had leftovers packed, then decided I'd say something to Leo, who was kind enough to comp. one of the entrees.  Fair enough, since I ate the equivalent of one.  Should I return again for happy hour, I'll probably just stick to two rolls- the dependable soft-shelled crab roll, w/c is wrapped in nori, then rice, and then w/ omelet, thin-sliced.  Yum!  \n\nSince I didn't enjoy the other two sushi rolls, I replaced them w/ a rainbow roll ($8.95), w/c originally consists of salmon, yellowtail, tuna, and shrimp, w/ avocado and cucumber.  Mine came w/o certain items, but still was pretty tasty, and definitely more colorful, and more texturally-satiating than the mashed disasters that were the salmon and tuna sushi.\n\nProbably won't be returning anytime soon for happy hour.  Certainly not since I've found a new place for happy hour sushi... Tempe's Sushi 101!"
3;This market makes me happy.  I'm happy that I can go there, twice a week, and buy from people that live in the area and make their living from it.  \n\nYes, it's not Seattle or San Francisco or Madison.  But it's HERE.  And it's getting bigger!  And people are going!\n\nThere are consistently good veggies, cheese, eggs, baked goods, and lots of other things to be found here.  I hope it keeps growing.  We need something like this to keep us connected to the World Beyond Concrete.  Yes, it's on gravel.  And it may be small.  But that doesn't mean you can't find the makings for a delicious meal there. \n\n:)
2;I agree with all of the reviews of this place.   It is over hyped.  Yea the view is great but as with most restaurants with a view the food never lives up to it.  Please try Isabella or even Monteray bay before shelling out le cash for le mont.
3;I love Yvonne's! They have an awesome $2.99 daily special.  Aw man, the biscuits and gravy on Wednesdays are really good.  They are pretty fast on the delivery as well. They are one of the few places that deliver to my office early in the morning.  It is our go to place to order breakfast.
1;"Um, yeah, no!  Not!  I love coffee houses, but if one is going to go with corporate coffee I would rather hit my local Starbucks that The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf.  \""Simply the best?\""  That is their motto, but I think not!  The artificial power they use in their drinks tastes nasty, and never fully disolves in either the hot drinks or the iced drinks.  There is always a nasty, sludgy mess in the bottom.  Plus the powder sticks in my throat and makes me cough.  And none of the employees know anything about the drinks.  They seen very disinterested.  If I am going to buy coffee I want it to be from a fun place.  If I want coffee with morning attitude I can make it at home, and experience by own bad attitude. This Coffee Bean has been a bad experience every time.  Hit the independent coffee houses, or hit the Coffee Beans older, and successful brother, Starbucks.  Why settle for second rate coffee?"
1;"This place makes decent drinks and food.  I've been here multiple times when I want some milk tea.  I came by here before driving back to LA for a drink to take for the road.  They had a \""monthly promo\"" special, which was $3.50 for iced milk tea or iced green milk tea with boba (medium size).\n\nI told the girl that I wanted just the green milk tea WITHOUT boba and she told me it was going to be more expensive.  I asked her how much and it was $.50 more without boba.  That didn't make any sense to me.  Why in hell would it be more expensive for more tea? I would figure boba would be more expensive than having another 25% more tea in my cup.  I know tea, milk and sugar is NOT that expensive.  The company needs to rethink that out before telling customers that.  It's just plain retarded.\n\nI caved in and just got the monthly special but I wasn't too happy about it.  I usually don't care for the boba and just want some milk tea to drink.  I would go back but only if I really craving some decent milk tea in the area."
0;"Went to go see Krewella, one of the most amazing and entertaining shows ever. 5 Stars easily for the show. \n\nWhy the 1 Star?\n\nLet's get into it. Bouncers. Half of these bouncers are on a stupid power trip. They rope off sections they doesn't even have the correct people who ordered VIP. The venus is stupid tiny, seriously, people were stepping on other folks shoes and the bouncers LITERALLY PUSHED PEOPLE DOWN THE STAIRS. Not only that, the gray suited bouncers, the supposed wanna be, ear piece wearing, power trip jackasses who thinks being a bouncer is the shit, we shoving people on purpose. They literally shoved me for no reason and I told him to relax, he replied in his whiskey drenched breath, \""NO YOU RELAX BRO. I'LL KICK YOU OUT.\"" Seriously, power trip much \""little man?\"" Anyways, the bouncers were getting women drunk and harassing them big time. Girls watch out, before you get assault's by Mandalay Bay's Bouncers. \n\nI literally made an account just because of my experiences at Light. This club's venue is stupid small, the bouncers are on power trips, they push people down the fucking stairs, and if you talk back, they will kick you out, and assault your drunk women. Thanks but no thanks."
3;Another place in  Vegas!  Thai food this time. I loved this place too, but not as much as I loved Meskerem. We brought a lot more people, we drank sake, spent a lot of money on food, put dares on people eating spicy food (which ended up being hilarious), and the servers were all very polite and respectful and again, another place in Vegas that stayed open later than their posted hours. \n\nI think we had 16 people with us? Maybe more? And the servers handled all of us extremely well. I got pad thai with vegan chicken at like maybe a 10 spice? it was perfect.\n\nProbably the best vegan pad thai I've ever had.
4;Good food, great service - the balcony has got the best view of Bellagio water show.  I tried the escargot for the first time there.  Loved it!
0;This place is disappointing. I've heard good things about brunch, but don't come for dinner. I had an appetizer. I sent it back because it was icebox cold, and it came back lukewarm. Definitely detracted from the experience. Beers for $5.75. I'm not coming back here.
4;Great place... excellent selection of Tea, Spices, Oils, and other goodies.  \n\nIts been tough to find a good basalmic place in town and they allow you to sample their products.  I tried a few others and I haven't found flavors that were close to what I was looking for.  \n\nTea selection is great.  Its like wine though... hard to know what you will like.  They have 3 teas to sample and they are very helpful.  Its nice that you can buy a small package and try a few to see if it fits your taste.  I'm a huge fan of tea and although I liked the almond Oolong, I'm not completely sold on it yet.  I'm still on a mission for a great tea of theirs. (Btw, True Foods and the coconut Oolong form Rishi are my favorites)\n\nI only wish that they were Organic... esp for the Oils.  \n\nI didn't have much time, but if you love cooking they have small packages of spices.  Its great that you can buy a little and see if you like it first.\n\nGreat store... definitely worth your time.
0;Supposed to be a place where you can go and drift your car, but they do not provide that service.
4;Peanut Butter Brownie Ice Cream.\n\nYes.\n\nLet's all take a minute, pause and appreciate that combination.\n\nMmmmhmmm. I originally rolled into Cold Mountain's next door (adjoined) neighbor, Jackson's Java. And then I walked around the corner and BAM, ice cream heaven. \n\nYep, Cold Mountain offers a nice variety of delectable ice cream flavors like Chocolate Caramel Cashew, Spumoni, Cotton Candy, Anniversary Cake and Amaretto Cherry. But folks, I highly recommend the Peanut Butter Brownie. Creamy peanut butter ice cream swirled with thick ripples of caramel and stuffed with chocolately brownie bites. \n\nAnd while the best part was the actual ice cream, the super friendly employee gave me the largest single scoop of ice cream I've seen in quite some time. We're talking softball size here, friends. My belts are quivering in anticipation of my return.
3;I don't specifically remember much about the Bellagio because I walked through a lot of the hotels during the day. What I do remember is that the decorations there are really nice. I'm talking about the glass art ceiling they have. They look like glass jellyfish, but are actually hand-blown glass flowers. There are a always quite  a bit of people in the room taking pictures of the ceiling. If you walk forward, there is another nicely decorated themed room. I went to Vegas after the Lunar New Year, so they had a lot of New year decorations, year of the rabbit decorations up, which were really nice. \n\nThere is also the water show in the front of the hotel, which is probably best seen at night. I didn't watch it this trip, more like drove by it while passing through the strip. \n\nOverall, pretty nice hotel.
0;Seriously just terrible food and service. The sliders were edible, but microwave white castle quality and flavor. The caprese salad, we had to send back. It had nasty old mealy tomatoes, a pesto paste, and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese and a balsamic sauce. I left hungry rather than wait for something else to be brought out for fear it would be equally repulsive.
2;Prices here are what you would expect from a College bookstore- high, but they do have pretty much everything you may need, from meds to pencils and calculators, snacks, and shirts, notebooks and even magazines and used, low priced movies. \nBooks are what they are- expensive.\nThe only issue I have with this place is the fricken lines. Why are we constantly changing the way the lines work here? One semester the line is over there, the next semester it is on the other side of the room, and forced behind the book shelves so anyone just coming in cannot see it. Stop being so Bipolar with the lines!\nOther than that, it is a pretty decent place, and the return policies are pretty cool.
1;I've been here twice now because sometimes you just want a burrito. However, I can do better myself (and in fact, every time I go by this place I think I should quit my job and open a near-campus taco stand). \n\nThe chicken tinga burrito was quite good and pretty close to California style. The burrito portions are small enough to finish and not make you too fat, which is a plus I think.\n\nNachos are likewise quite good. Good for sharing, disappear fast.\n\nHowever, this place serves the worst enchiladas I've had in long time. Decent tortillas and shredded chicken filling, but the sauce is canned and they top them with wilted lettuce and cheese that is dry and crumbly like parmesan in a can. Ick.\n\nAlso, the stools are really uncomfortable, and they serve their sodas in styrofoam cups.
2;Since when do you use regular broccoli in pad as ew? Ewww! I was craving Thai and this place did not fix my fix. I ordered for pick up and when I got there after the 15 minutes they told me, was when they started to cook my food because I heard the guy call out my order again. The chicken they use always looks like the throw away pieces to me too.
2;Not bad, not outstanding. If I was staying there I'd eat there again. I wouldn't drive far to sample the place. But if you're close it will do!\n\nDecor is really cheesy, like I'm on a cruise ship cheesy.
0;"IT GOT ME SICK!!!\n\nMe and my wife tried this place for the first time. We were going to go to another place for dinner, however we gave this local place a try. We were very disappointed and surprised that the meals we had was that expensive, and thus did not match the quantity or quality.  The food was NOT \""authentic\"" as they claim, it's as authentic as \""El Charrito\"" or \""Old El Paso\"" frozen mexican meals. \nThe only thing worth giving it 1 star was that the server was kind, however slow... With that said we will not be back, unless they have a change in management or owners.\n\nLater.....\nTo Top it all off...I was sick to my stomach all last night, with frequent trips to the toilet, pretty painful.\n\nPS  I even contacted the \""manager\"" later that evening and told him that  I was sick from eating there..He exclaimed that he would \""look into it\"" - no comping my meal, no offering to make me go back. He simply stated \"" We'll I hope you give us another try...:\"" - Not a very good response from \""Management.\"" \n\nNOT GOOD! A DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE!!!"
1;"I get dragged here because the hub is a Hawkeye and Sandbar just happens to be the only Iowa bar in the east valley. Saturday morning can be pretty crazy, however don't expect speedy service, or good service for that matter. Not sure what happened this year. Last season the service was much better, the servers were friendly and prompt. \n\nOne Saturday I came with the hub and a group of friends. We ordered  2 breakfast burritos off the brunch menu. 20 minutes later, the waitress came by to verify our order (she didn't even put the order in yet!) 40 minutes later we finally got our food. Our drinks took a millennium to get to us as well. \n\nNow I get if a bar or restaurant is busy you will wait more than usual, but communicate that to us. \""Hey we are swamped right now as you can see, I will get your order to you as soon as possible\"".  I get when the server has a bad day, we all have them, but it's hard to have a good experience when everyone has on a sour puss. \n\nTo be fair, the food we ordered was hot and tasty. Just wish they would -UP-  the customer service a little more. \n\n**ALSO be warned, if you open a tab with a credit card, they put an automatic $50 hold on your account, maybe just bring CASH***"
4;"I have never written a review for a restaurant | bar before; however, after my meal last night, I was compelled to share my experience. Everyone knows that Tender serves delicious drinks. I myself have been enjoying amazing craft cocktails in Tender's swanky environment for quite some time. The restaurant is clean and tastefully decorated; the staff are friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable.  \n\nWhat surprised me was the addition of chef Brian Little to the Tender team.  Last night Brian created the most delicious, tender, fall-off-the-bone lamb shank I have ever had.  The impressive caveman-like shank of meat was artfully plated with complementary sauces, potatoes, and mushrooms picked fresh that day.  Food of this caliber is something that many, including myself, may not associate with Tender. Realizing this, I decided to write this review. Spread the word folks, Tender has food... and its amazing!"
3;Stayed over on the Fourth of July to celebrate my best friends birthday. We hung out by the pool all day and enjoyed the friendly staff  bringing us drinks pool side. The pool was soooo hot like bath water, sometimes this isn't bad but when it's 115 outside your getting in a pool to cool down not to boil. After enjoying our time pool side we headed back to the room for the night. \n\nThe room was beautiful. Mexico vibe living room area and two beds in the room connecting. The bathroom was also really nice...  Big. The layout of the room was interesting, but still comfortable. I also liked that we had a small little balcony with a nice view! Everything was great but during the night the ac broke. We tried to suck it up but we were steaming hot! It's was soooo hot we ended up leaving. No bueno. The next morning we came back to check out of the room and when we explained what happened they took care of our room for us. That's was I call awesome hospitality! The staff all around was awesome and made my experience a great one! Ill be back for sure, despite the mishap with the air.
1;"They're getting two stars instead of one because in the end they gave me the Pissed- Off Customer Discount.  Still won't be back.  Went in earlier today for an oil change.  When the got to me they showed me some filters and told me \""The last guys who serviced your truck should have seen this.\""  Problem was that last guys to service my truck were the fine professionals at this Jiffy Lube.  The customer service person I was dealing with couldn't come to terms with that and kept insisting the Nissan missed the problem.  So we have a problem with competence and general situational awareness.  Also I have driven the truck for over 80,000 miles.  I have never seen those filters before.  Not convinced they actually belong in my truck.  I told him to just do the oil change and that I'd never be back.  He still couldn't figure out why I was mad.  I'll be going to Wal-Mart for oil changes in the future."
2;Food was not that great.  Chips and salsa were good.  Chicken buritto was mediocre.
2;I enjoyed my stay here and really enjoyed the Desert Passage shopping as well.  No problem getting a late checkout (key when you don't get to your room until 6am).  Clean room but the bathroom had NO water pressure which is awful.  There's a lot to do without having to leave the casino proper and quite a few clubs to frequent as well.  It also was relatively inexpensive given that there were a few of us staying in the room together.  It's not the best hotel I've ever stayed in but it's certainly not the worst.
1;I was very happy to see that a Panera opened in Phoenix. Panera was my favorite restaurant back in Michigan where I'm from, so I was glad to try it out. \n\nThe food is good and while I agree the price is a little high, it is comparable from what I remember. The problem is the service. It seems like the staff has no idea what they're doing and they get easily confused. While I was waiting for my takeout, they had to ask what I had. It took nearly 10 minutes to get my Chicken Caesar Salad, and the restaurant was slow. I suppose they were growing the lettuce from my salad from the garden because it took so long. \n\nThe staff is not rude - they're very friendly - just a lot of disorganization.
4;Yummy and cheap!  In my last visit, I gave it 4 stars. This visit I am bumping it to FIVE, yes 5 yelp stars.\n\nIts probably the tastiest thin crust pizza in the Strip.  Its not really that hidden.  Go to the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, find the pool table (which probably kids are goofying off at) and you'll see a hallway of records.  There's that so-called pizza place.\n\nWe came here with Stephen's mom and each got a slice of something different. We wanted 3 diet cokes, and the guy suggested getting a 2-liter of diet coke for $6.50 versus 3 separate cup of cokes for $4 each.  Wow, what a nice guy!  He could have easily had a $12 sale on drinks, but saved us $5.50.\n\nSo 3 slices plus a 2-liter came to $22.  We took our slices down the hall and watch snotty 12 year olds attempt to play billiards.\n\nSecret pizza is, IMHO, the hidden gem of Las Vegas.
4;I personally had a very fun experience here last night. Vicki did my manicure/pedicure, and Jeri (sp) had also helped with my manicure- she even gave me a bottle of cuticle oil as a small gift to to help me with my horrible biting habit. So nice! I never had to wait for any service- I felt they took great care of me the whole time I was there.\n\nNick, the manager, was very friendly. All of them made me feel so welcome..and for me to feel comfortable enough to open up to new people right away is very rare. They were all incredibly easy to talk to, and this is what made my experience worth it for me. My nails look great, too! I will definitely be back.
2;Solid hotel and very cheap.  We would go back.
3;"This place is pretty awesome. They make a lot of donuts so much that the next day they offer  20 of them for five bucks. If you are looking for dependably decent donuts and you are in the area; if recommend it. Just be aware it's no Ronalds donuts... This is a good second though..tied with Masters donuts."
4;admittedly, i am a hell of a tough critic when it comes to thai food.  the same can be said about a few different cuisines, but with thai food specifically, i critique not just on taste, but on their ability to listen to my needs.  i am allergic to coconut, AND i can only handle a moderate amount of spicy stuff (unless i'm just in a spicy food kind of mood).  when visiting a thai restaurant, if the server does not appear to be listening to my two requirements, i am instantly leery and play it safe with pad thai or something common like that.\n\nwith all that said, OMFG, this place was SO goooooood!  i had been working reeeeally hard on sunday night and after a hellacious day and night of work, i happened upon this place with a friend and a coworker.  i say happened upon it because i am not from Las Vegas, and was only in town for work from LA.  my coworker is a total food.  my friend is a persnickety eater.  we were all overjoyed and satisfied with our food.\n\nmy coworker (the fellow foodie) had a spicy shrimp thing, which i believe was a sort of curry, but my hunger prevented me from paying closer attention to his order.  my friend (the picky eater) had a chicken in yellow curry.  i had the dish that was accurately named Seafood Delight.  delighted indeed i was!  first of all, i asked the waiter to have it made only slightly spicy.  they couldn't have possibly gotten the spice level more perfect!  it was amazing.  the aforementioned delights included:  shrimp, fishballs, scallops, mussels, and a myriad of appropriately matched veggies.  it was fantastic.  \n\nfor a second i wondered if my hunger and tiredness contributed to how positively i received this meal, but no, this place stood as an excellent thai spot regardless of my pitiful state.  it bums me out that such an awesome thai place isn't actually found in LA.  i mean, some of the spots in thai town in hollywood are great, but this place is head and shoulders above it.  i'm not sure when i'll be back in Vegas, but whenever that is, i certainly hope to return here.  my foodie coworker concurred with this sentiment.  emphatically, five stars!
3;We booked our tour through Viator as I thought it would be cheaper.    However, in comparison with other tour providers the prices were very similar, it only depended what kind of tour you would prefer and basically how much time you had.   Initially I was a bit biased as I could not find many reviews on Viator but they were selling HeliUSA tours and turned out to be very professional and reliable.   Our pilot Alexander was very informative and enthusiastic tour guide.   Overall the experience was really amazing to admire all the stunning views from the air.    It was about 1h flight via the Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam, Lake Lead.   Grand Canyon as one of the Seven Natural Wonders Of  The World proved its beauty entirely.
0;Please keep in mind that I am a very understanding person (if you notice, I rarely write negative reviews) but this situation is too much and I feel people need to be aware. Especially since I have already tried to resolve it with the store management. \n\nI received threats, yes threats, on my answering machine from the employee trying to make me rush down to the store and fix a mistake she made on the contract. This charming young lady (Jay?) stated that they would come to my home and take the furniture if it wasn't corrected immediately. \n\nNow keep in mind that I have a job of my own to do. I was happy to help them correct the error, but I cannot drop everything to do so. If you have made a mistake it seems unreasonable to me to expect your customer to disrupt their life to cover your behind. You need to ask nicely and wait for it to be convenient for your customer to get it squared away. \n\nIt seems even more unreasonable that you think threats are an appropriate way to request a customer's assistance. \n\nOk, I manage a staff. I understand that employees occasionally put their foot in their mouth and as a manager you have the unique opportunity to turn the situation around... Right? NOPE! Her manager did nothing. Actually stated that threatening customers to correct contract errors made by staff is their policy (not even touching the idea that the winners they hire screw up contracts enough that there needs to be a policy!) \n\nReturning the furniture just to not deal with them anymore. Sad because I love the product and it fits perfectly in my apartment. Nothing is worth that kind of hassle though. Unreal.
4;"Welcome to Surprise, BR!  Very clean and friendly!  Although there are other ice cream, yogurt and custard places in town, we will make this our \""go to\"" dessert choice now!"
3;Fat Face is the kind of place I used to shop in my teens, picking up tees, jeans and jewellery at affordable prices. The kind of look they're going for is skater/surfer chic and since I grew out of that phase many moons ago I tend to steer clear of Fat Face.\n\nI was surprised then, when I popped in the other day to find some items I'd actually wear now. They had some really pretty summer dresses that reminded me of the ones in Joy, except the ones here were quite a bit cheaper. They also had some really pretty beaded bags that would be great for beach bags on holiday and in the sale section I noticed the comfiest pair of  mules I've ever seen in my life and they were only \u00a315!\n\nThey have a great selection of jewellery too and although not my style, great for a younger crowd. \n\nOf course, they still stock surfer chic items with some great quality sandals and other beach wear. I also really noticed the quality of the items here, the polo shirts nice thick material that don't look like they'd fall apart in the wash like some other shops. \n\nThe staff in here are also really nice and as soon as I walked in I was greeted by a bubbly member of staff. \n\nOverall, I was pleasantly surprised by the stock here and will perhaps pop in now and again rather than just assuming I won't like anything.
3;This place has a great selection of wine and beer. This store is huge and it is very easy to get lost trying to find what you want. The only thing that I think BevMo has an advantage over is that it has a greater soda collection. Well it at least stocks  Fevertree ginger ale, which is possibly one of the best ginger ales I have tried so far. The cider selection here is definitely better than the selection at the BevMo stores I have been to. \nTotal Wine closes an hour later than BevMo which is great when you are feeling for some alcohol at night.
0;"This review is an honest one. I met with Alberto on Friday he came on time was a nice person gave me an estimate to begin the work the following Wednesday. He gave me a price the price was fair so I accepted his offer. I asked him to come around 8-9am on wednesday because I had a doctor's appt. at 1pm he said no problem and left my house. On wednesday the appt date he did not show up at 8, or 9, or 10am I had to call him and he did not even remember who I was or my address nothing. At first he said \""my guys should be there oh there not there I will be there in 30 minutes\"".  but obviously he could not be here because he did not even no my address or remember the appointment. After 30 minutes 10:30am I called again and then he asked for my address again.  Then he admitted that he had forgotten my appt. because he saw so many people. etc. Oh well, I cancelled completely with him because if this is the way of  starting with a client then it is not very professional and I did not want to have to call every other week to get him to come and do the job. Sorry, I don't feel he is realiable."
1;Who would win in a fight?  The Desert Ridge CPK or its neighbor across the street Humble Pie (c'mon, I can't be the first to make the comparison)  Probably 15 years ago I used to love the CPK chopped salad.  Anymore it lacks flavor and looks to be skimping on ingredients.  CPK's wine is pretty expensive ($9 for a glass of something I pay $10 for a bottle of at Costco?), and the place doesn't exactly exude local personality (only a recent transplant would have the A/C down to 70 the first week of April).  So when a couple is given a choice to drop $50 at CPK or $40 at Humble Pie...
1;To try someplace new, we visited the Akropolis Cafe one day for lunch.  We sat ourselves at a table in a rather blah setting.  Nobody came by and then...nobody came by.  We looked around and noticed that there was one other table of people and someone standing for takeout.  Both sets were waiting for their food.  Angrily.  And apparently only one person working?  He was doing the cooking.  It soon became evident that it was a family owned business...and only one family member showed up for work that day.  As the woman waiting for her takeout became vocal, we decided to duck out and go somewhere else.  I only get an hour for lunch...and I didn't want to spend it sitting at a table with no service watching a fight break out.  \n\nSo, sad to say, my review is based only on the service I experienced and observed during a visit one day for lunch to Akropolis Cafe.  I have not yet been back, and based on that experience during what should have been a slow period of the day, most likely won't give them a second chance.  I'd hate to see what happens when they actually might have a full restaurant!
1;"We came to this practice with high hopes based on these reviews. Our first consultation was great, Dr was very friendly. One thing was off he kept referring to our child as \"" the kid\"" but we liked him anyway. The next \""emergency\"" visit was our first sick  visit. Our baby had been suffering from severe diarrhea and diaper rash. Dr quickly replied to emails and then after 2 days had us come in. That's when everything went sour! We were kept waiting in tut lobby which is not designed for babies or kids because this is NOT a pediatric office. As I said baby was suffering from severe diarrhea so we kept having to go to our car to change her because there isn't anywhere to change a baby that they could offer us. Dr was \""running late\"" but after 1.5 hour we ran out of wipes and were pretty upset because we saw the lunch delivery from come in and everyone, even the front desk disappeared. I get that that happen, people run late and people need lunch but when you aren't on time, it shows where your priorities are. I would not recommend this office to anyone with an infant or toddler for that matter, it's clearly set up for adults. While the Doctor was clearly very intelligent and knowledgable what happened to us was insulting. I've waited months to put this post up because I thought if get over it, but I don't want anyone else to be \""duped\"" by the 5 stars like we were."
3;"Huge chocolate sculptures greet and entice you as the voices inside your head say, \""go ahead, it's ok.  Diet tomorrow\"".  The displays are enchanting...attracting tourists (and locals as well) for a photo op.  Once you get past the crowd and actually make it to the counter, you see the many beautiful yummylicious options you have: gelato, pastries, cookies, sandwiches, etc.  You find yourself in a huge dilemma: what should you get?\n\nI've been to this place many times but I still go through this process over and over.  So, I always end up getting the same thing: 2 scoops of gelato and a crepe then I get some macarons to go.  I start daydreaming about those beautiful cherry blossom cakes as I'm eating my crepe, \""what would be a good occasion for me to have that cake? Hmmmm...\""  You know that feeling when there's a really cute person in front of you and all you could say is \""hi!\"" and you're too pre-occupied daydreaming?  Yup, the food here has that effect on me.\n\nOne of these days, I'll muster up the courage to ask for a Nutella napoleon.  Be bold!"
3;Seriously good food...not cheap but worth it. Quality and quantity. Place is clean, colorful and service is quick. Bacon wrapped shrimp are phenomenal as well as the crab enchilada and shrimp ceviche.
3;It has been a while, and a lot of visits later to Perfect Scoop. Something is different.\n\nI'm not sure if it's a partnership change or what, but every month or so I'd say it's a little less quality. It must be growing pains because as far as I can tell, two new branches opened and then it all started.\n\nPeter, the owner, has not been in this branch for a while now. When he was there, I knew what I was going to get was the best he could offer. Be it the freshly brewed jasmine milk tea, or vegan ice cream that he could talk to me about. It's just not the same. I don't even see jasmine milk tea on the menu, and when I asked about it - apparently it's powder now? I don't know.\n\nThis isn't to say it isn't still acceptable. It's fine. I haven't had any induced bowel movements yet, a la Stephanie K. Prices are still the same and the selection is relatively the same. There are a few different flavors at the branch on Jones. But at this rate it will simply blend back into mediocrity. I hope this does not happen.
1;Up sold on many items in burro and greedy with the grilled chicken. Huge tortilla but this company likes to make it look big with rice and beans only.
1;Weirdest nights ever.\nWormhole tequila black-out.\nToo crowded/hot/cold.\n\n(b)
0;This has to be the worst Mexican food in Las Vegas!!!  I ordered the Chimichanga with Chili Colorado.  It was 95% canned refried beans and 5% meat.  It was topped with 1 black olive and a gigantic glob of sour cream, making it a soggy mess.  The chips were like styrofoam, and the salsa tasted like something from the generic section of Walmart.  The best part of the meal was the ice water.  The slop they serve at Taco Bell and Robertos is far superior to this place.  Other reviews talk about the Margaritas- if I had had enough of these, I might not care about the food here.  The only positive was the waitress, who was very nice and attentive.
1;Trickery - this restaurant is now called Pho Tempe but used to be Saigon Pho... and it's still only 2 stars. \n\nWe went tonight and ordered 3 things. Since it claims to be Thai and Vietnamese, we ordered Pad Thai noodles, Pho Chin, fried rice and Thai tea. You'd think that at least something was good but nope, none of it was good... other than the Thai tea. \n\nThey delivered the smallest bowl of weak broth pho I've ever seen (with only 3 pieces of meat). It arrived 10 min before the rest of the food arrived, with no spoons. The Pad Thai noodles, which are normally a dryer noodle, were swimming in sauce , had very little chicken, and had no peanuts (wth?).  The fried rice was... interesting.  My dad said he thought it was decent but wouldn't reorder it.  The rest of us didn't like it.  \n\nBut the worst part was the TV. The movies playing had had curse words, people puking (not kidding) and tons of violence... That's definitely not appropriate while my 3-year old, retired parents and I were trying to eat. Since there were other kids there, too, I ask them to change it.  They changed it from an F-bomb movie to the movie that had vomit scenes... Nice. Then they wouldn't change it on my 2nd request so my toddler got an eyeful all through dinner. We almost got up at left at this point. Put a cooking show or the travel channel on the TV! Then you'll have something appropriate for all ages and tastes to watch.\n\nThe Thai tea was good and the interior looks nice but my parents said to watch out for the bathrooms. \n\nI was trying to get my culinary conservative parents into Viet food since my fianc\u00e9, toddler and in-laws are all Vietnamese but this restaurant was a big disappointment.  \n\nDefinitely won't see you there (especially when Khai Hoan is right down the road).
3;I almost let everyone else's reviews affect mine!\nEverything I ate there was delicious, and the portions were large. I'd write more, but I went there to enjoy a 2nd time on 3.14.13, and it was CLOSED.\n\nIt looks like they were evicted or something involving an angry orange sticker on the door. :-( It's too bad, they were a great addition to the Water St. area.
2;"When visiting Vegas for the first time and if this the first club that you go to then I say yes, GREAT TIME. However going here after experiencing other places on the strip, is kind of a let down. It's not as big as I thought it would be, and the dancers don't really build up any excitement...because you can't see them! They're so high up I wouldn't have known they were there. \n\nI do admire them for their awe-some bar display; compliments to their very high ceilings. And their bartenders seem to be more knowledgeable than most in regards to drink requests. Overall, average review. Didn't strike me as anything special."
3;Dan Dan Noodles. I can't get past that on the menu. It's a must have. \n\nChile seared soy sauce, minced chicken, scallions, garlic, bean sprouts, cucumbers, egg noodles...good. \n\nGreat take out or dine in. I know it's a chain, but a good restaurant feel. \n\nSelf serve fortune cookies....how many have you taken?
0;"If you like BUGS in your food, then this is your place to go!\n\nNo, seriously. I used to be a devoted Griddle fan.. This was my go-to for a breakfast spot..  Until I had two NASTY accidents here within a week of each other! \n\nI had visited this place with my sister. She ordered a chicken salad sandwich of some sorts. When her order came, she lifted a slice of the bread to add salt and pepper, and what do you know, a BUG was crawling in her sandwich. We immediately sent it back, and noticed a few diners looked a little turned off from their food.. So my sister agreed to just order the same thing. They \""made\"" her a new one, which came out suspiciously fast, for \""making\"" a new sandwich?\n\nNow for the second round. I decided to go here again later on in the week on my lunch hour with a coworker. I ordered my usual egg white omelette with potatoes. As I am slicing my potatoes, there is very CLEARLY a DEAD FRIED FLY IN MY POTATOES. \n\nThis place is disgusting. I will not be back. Sorry, Griddle, but take better care of your sanitation. NASTY."
0;"all i can say is wow....never have i been so dissapointed in how i spent 32 bucks.Ive eaten and baked alot of cupcakes in my day and im such a sucker for good sweets.These however were anything but good. First of all they were to dense and wayyyyy to dry. overly sweet cake mixed with overly sweet iceing doesnt make for even a decent cupcake.Some of the flavors they choose to combine were far from tasty and the way the went about introduceing the flavors was off, i mean we got what they wanted to portray but it just wasent what it should have been.all in all it was a dissapointing experiance. even my 5 year old told me \""mom your cupcakes are better\"" and i couldnt agree more especially for 32 dollars."
1;I heard a lot of great things about this place but was sadly disappointed. The margaritas were not impressive and I felt like the food was all heat, no flavor.  Thankfully the service was really great!
3;I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  The food is extra amazing and consistent and the added benefit of knowing you are eating healthy is a home run!\n\nThe summary states its not good for kids, and I am confused by this.  We bring our 4 kids and they LOVE it.  I see kids in here all the time without any problem...we should be setting a good, healthy example of eating for our kids.\n\nMy only vice with True Food is that they are VERY expensive.  When you are buying organig in massive bulk like they do, it just shouldn't cost $18 for a lunch portion of steak tacos.  I can't get my family of 6 out of there without dropping $100 MINIMUM!  That hurts, as we would LOVE to eat here all the time, but we would be broke!\n\nDont ever leave this place without having the flourless chocolate cake with real vanilla bean ice cream!  OMG!!!!!!  Heaven!!!
3;"The Costco of alcohol. \n\nWith miles and miles of bad decisions, Lee's literally has something for everyone's taste... I'm not sure if that's a good thing for Las Vegas or not? Nonetheless, this is my go to spot for a quick bottle of wine or that pesky whiskey craving that usually comes over me towards the end of a work week. \n\nI love me some whiskey and although the options here can be a bit overwhelming, they are also exciting at the same time. Sometimes I'll play the \""random bottle game\"" just to see what I like and don't like; the best part about this game is that you really never lose. \n\nLike I said, something for everyone... Craft Beer, wine, Tequila, and beyond. The prices can be a little higher too, a lot higher than other liquor stores in fact, but I would rather walk into a clean and inviting place of business than some sketchy liquor store with dust on the bottles and outdated product. \n\nPRO-TIP: Always call a cab!"
1;I don't know how they managed to serve me a cold burrito but that just happened. Also 70 cents cheaper than in San Diego.
4;True Roasters on Nesbitt is one of my favorite places to go for cappuccino. The coffee used for this delectable drink is so fresh and so expertly roasted. If you need a gift for a coffee person, you really can't go wrong with a freshly roasted pound of French Roast or Sumatra!\n\nThe staff is very friendly and the coffee is amazing.
4;This place is awesome! You can do AYCE & try allot of different roles! Came here in a group of 4 & tried 26 different half roles, nigiri & some tempura shrimp. So worth the food & the price!
4;"I consider myself a breakfast enthusiast..........always in search of the BEST!  Today, along with three family members, I ate at a friends brand-spankin' NEW restaurant called Babycakes Cafe on Buffalo and Smoke Ranch.  I find myself rendered speechless; it was so FANTASTIC!\nWe're a sharing family, the only way to eat out in my opinion, so I was able to try a little bit of everything.\n\n~If you like a little KICK, eat the Portuguese sausage!\n~Rick's adobo fried rice and eggs with macaroni salad.......WTF?  FANTASTIC! \n~Perfectly cooked over-medium eggs!\n~Hash browns.....YAY, HASH BROWNS!\n~Benny's, oh how I love thee....!\n~Lastly, pancakes...........my favorite food of all time!  \n        *Red Velvet- Better than actual cake!\n        *Bacon- So delish!\n        *CARROT CAKE- (SIGH) These are hands down the GREATEST  \n          pancakes that I have ever eaten!  I am without words..........!\n\nYou'd be doing yourself a favor if you go to Babycakes Cafe!\n=)"
0;I was so looking forward to the opening of this place but have ended up being so disappointed by their food. On my first visit, I got an almond croissant and 2 macarons. (not macaroons, folks--that's a completely different cookie) The croissant was extremely dry with some sort of weird gummy paste inside. The macarons were refrigerated, which is really a crime against pastry. I get the feeling that they are not made fresh daily, which totally ruins the quality. Day old, cold macarons are never good. The filling in the pistachio one was also very greasy. I ended up spitting it out and throwing the rest away.\n\nOn my 2nd visit, I tried another croissant, another macaron and a baguette. The baguette was good but not worth a special trip for. The croissants and macarons have not improved at all. \n\nThe dinner options seem to be more Creole based which is not really my interest. I haven't seen a lot of options available at the French grocery that make it worth a special trip. I'll just wait for the new location of Essence Bakery to open if I want good French pastries. \n\nI just came back from a 10 day trip to France so I've had the real deal and it's so much better than what this place has to offer. I don't really see any reason to go back.
4;Looking for a new spot down town try this place service was excellent food if possible even better I am a former catering chef and my wife is a personal chef so when we go out we are very picky and critical but we honestly have not one comp lainteverything from the time you enter the place until you leave is on point no wonder they've been around for 28 years  our waiter was Scott and very pleasant and a real pro the wine list is great and with a happy hour daily you can't go wrong strongly recommend that you try this spot asap
4;Halcyon is one of the coolest, most eclectic spots in all of Charlotte.  While it's bit pricey, it is well worth it.  \n\nThe atmosphere here is one of my favorite parts of it.  There are walls of windows looking out over uptown Charlotte.  The dining room is small and open.  It's nice, but very casual and earthy.  I love the tables, they are made of what looks like huge thinly cut tree stumps.  That is probably giving you a very weird visual, but it'll make sense once you see them.  You also have the Mint Museum right there and you don't even have to walk outside to go to it.\n\nThe cocktail menu is the most unique list you will find anywhere.  You'll see all kinds of original concoctions that are created by the on-staff mixologist who is basically a genius.  For food, there are lots of offerings that you won't find at many restaurants (rabbit sausage anyone?) as well as some Southern classics like shrimp and grits.  The most recent dish I had there was the duck confit.  It was truly outstanding.  Fresh ingredients, tender meat, and loaded with flavor.  \n\nIf Halcyon is not on your short list of places to try, go ahead and put it on there, stat.
2;I had the smoked meat poutine here. This is more of a cold weather dish for me or I would order it again if I haven't eaten all day. Come here if you are hungry, also, its open 24/7.
4;We had a wonderful lunch today. I had the soup(Broccoli, my favorite) plus a mini 1topping deep dish pizza & Jerry had a hamburger with skinny fries. They were delicious! Great service. As a vet, Jerry's lunch was free. We will be back again soon.
1;Es kommt einfach auch auf die Motivation an, mit der man die Rote Taube besucht ....\n\nMir gef\u00e4llt es dort nicht besonders gut. Das liegt zum einen an dem meiner Meinung nach nicht sehr fixen Service, dem meiner Meinung nach mehr als durchschnittlichen Essen und der meiner Meinung nach schlechten Beleuchtung mancher Tische.\n\nAu\u00dferdem ist der Raucherbereich nicht sauber vom Rest abgetrennt und die Kneipe (und man selbst) riecht nach Rauch.\n\nDer Biergarten im Au\u00dfenbereich ist ganz nett, wenn auch auf Bierzeltgarnituren nicht wirklich gem\u00fctlich sind und zum zur\u00fccklehnen einladen.\n\nDie Taube ist eine Institution in Karlsruhe, die man m\u00f6gen muss.
4;Uhm, I'm not from Phoenix so when our friend suggested a hike, I was just expecting your normal hike with a little uphill action. We took the Echo Canyon Trail and it was the most intense uphill hike I have ever been on. We brought a water bottle without a sack - and that was a huge rookie mistake because you absolutely need both hands to climb up this mountain. The view from the top is breathtaking and you can see the entire city from there. I feel like I conquered the world coming up and then coming down this insane mountain.\n\nWater is absolutely necessary and bring a camelback or backpack. It took us about 2.5 hours round trip.
2;"4/21/11\n\nHeard about this place from coworkers who all commented on how tiny it was.  And though they were correct (the space is small), I liked the layout of the bar, women's restroom, VIP tables, and patio.  Thanks to 98.7 The Peak, my group of 6 was able to secure a VIP table (we chose one of two silver-curtained tables) with free appetizers (3 max.), which helped out a lot in terms of controlling costs, as drinks were pricy (which is to be expected from a resort nightclub)!  Thursdays are \""Ladies' Night,\"" which means no cover charge for women and drink \""specials\"" from 6:30p to 8p.  Drinks include $3 domestic bottles of beer, $5 glasses of wine (choice of 2 reds and 2 whites, Sycamore wine), and $8 martinis.  Shots were $9 each (!!), and our group of 6 had 3 rounds of Pineapple Upside-Downs, B-52s, and Butterscotch!  Mmm!\n\nWe were there from 6:30p through 10p, and there were only about five groups until The Peak's raffle at 8p commenced and ended, and then there were pretty much just two groups- mine and another of about five.  (I'm guessing they also won a VIP pass, courtesy of the station.)  Cuz mentioned that VIP passes can be found on the website, BUT we were able to try the Calamari (w/ spicy aioli) and the Beijing chicken nachos (w/ crispy wonton strips, hoisin bbq'd chicken, and Asian guacamole).  We all LOVED the calamari, while the nachos were met w/ mixed views.  I think the crispy wonton strips were the culprits w/ the rest of my group-- I actually liked the dish, although my request to have the guacamole \""on the side,\"" I'm guessing, went unheeded; The lights were turned down very low, and we couldn't see what we were eating.  :(  I love avocados, but they don't love me, and I am paying quite a price for either the bartender's or the kitchen's carelessness AND my recklessness for trying it (w/out being able to see what I was eating) for the next few days!\n\nBartender Bob, who was flying solo, was friendly and attentive, but as the afternoon turned into night, he began to get bogged down w/ drink and food requests.  (He brought over our first round of shots, but we had to take the next three rounds back to our table ourselves; my second order of calamari was forgotten; and I had to remind him of it again about an hour later).  We had a good time, even though Airia didn't start to fill up until just when we were ready to leave (around 10p).  Would I come back again?  Probably not, unless I win another VIP table pass w/ free apps AND complimentary B-52s!  ;)"
1;Interesting place. Burgers or sushi or both is definitely different. But there is ALWAYS a wait, you can't do a reservation and they are over priced. Can definitely think of better places to go.
4;My husband and I went here for breakfast during the first day of our honeymoon. We were considering visiting Napa and I really wanted to go to one of Keller's restaurants , so eating here was high on the list for dining in Vegas for me.\n\nI ordered the sourdough waffles and a side of bacon, my husband the breakfast american with a strawberry croissant, one of the daily specials, as his pastry. We both got coffee and his meal came with juice.\n\nThe coffee was good but didn't stick out in anyway other than tasting relatively freshly brewed. No burnt coffee, yay! The waffles, served with syrup, vanilla bean butter, and strawberries, were fantastic. It was especially glorious to have all three together on a bite of waffle, the flavors melding together. The effect was a light sort of sweetness that wasn't too heavy or overwhelming. Possibly one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. The bacon was...bacon. And there was a lot of it. It was actually bordering on too much bacon.\n\nI got a bite of the husbands croissant, which was also incredibly delicious. It had a think layer of strawberry jam and was topped with a crumb topping and served warm. The fresh, tart flavor of the jam kept the pastry from being overwhelming rich. It was really tasty and I wish we had brought some home. Husbands eggs were over easy, cooked perfectly, and he said the flavors in his sausage were very good too.\n\nWould have gone back a few more times were it not so damned far from our hotel.
2;Completely disappointed with the breadsticks and salad today the salad was watery they didn't dry it off our server was phenomenal
0;Rude service mediocre food and slow delivery times. The breakfast burritos are good and they keep me coming back to this place. They do offer free delivery which is a plus. Most of the time the food is cold by the time it gets to you. Every time I try to get away from this place, they pull me back in. At the end of the day, the food is well priced, the delivery is free, and the burritos are still worth the wait. Why mess up a good thing? And that's that
0;"This is the second time we have been in this restaurant. The first time we wanted teppanyaki and they said no we didn't have a reservation. I thought this is a restaurant     Well we tried it again and there was no one in the place. Who ever owns/ runs the place must be delusional. Even if the dinners was free we wouldn't return. Take my advise and don't waste your time or money.  Shame on you whoever owns this place.  Take a good look at your business and try to understand that's it's important to make the customer feel welcome and enjoy the meal. At one point our waitress was screaming a conversation across the bar to someone at the opposite side of the place. Does anyone even care. To top it off the menu is a joke, Xerox copies  of \""stuff\""on a clip board."
2;Ok food.\nOk setting.\nOk pricing. \n\nYou get what you pay for  and it's certainly something you won't be craving for afterwards.  Mostly pancakes and waffles. Very limited choices on meat dishes. Just bacon and sausage links and patties. Coffee is okay, something you could definitely make at home taste better.
2;Tonkatsu black, takoyaki, gyoza, and Jinya bun.\n\nTonkatsu black was creamy and the broth was good but I felt it was lacking something. Not sure what that something is but I added chili to give some spice. I ordered it with thick noodles. The egg was cooked perfectly. Over time the broth did become too salty to my liking. \n\nThe takoyaki had a very nice preservation and came with a sauce that was creamy and very rich. It was delicious at first but by the end the richness was very overpowering. The octopus was roughly chopped and inside a fried ball shell. \n\nGyoza was alright. Not the best but not the worst I've tried. Not memorable.\n\nThe jinya bun was my favorite. Moist, sweet and melted in your mouth. I'd come again just for the buns. \nThe staff was very nice and prompt. They all stood good bye as we left.
4;I ADORE Benihanas! I have never been disappointed by any of their restaurants in any state I have been in thus far. \n\nI have been eating at Benihanas since I was born, no lie. It is my all time favorite restaurant no matter how hokey the tricks and jokes may be, a smile is plastered on my face from beginning to end. I have encountered fallen knives, shrimp tails soaring through the air, you name it. No matter how amazing or not so amazing the  chef has been, I always know I'll be leaving full and extremely satisfied with delicious & fresh Japanese food.\n\nThis location was very beautiful, clean, and modern. From the moment you enter the building you know you're in for a culinary adventure. Entertainment at your table, and delicious food that never seems to end!\n\nAbsolutely recommend to anyone and everyone! Definitely stop by on an empty stomach!!! They don't joke around with their portions.
1;Came at around 1am for steak and eggs...\n\nSteak and eggs: Steak was too fatty on the side, yet kinda dry on the inside. How that works, I'm not sure. I wasn't too fond of it. It's a good deal though for midnight steak and eggs (around $10). You also get toast and eggs and potatoes. \n\nFruit bowl: Fruit with a banana nut muffin and yogurt. Yogurt tasted like Dannon's strawberry yogurt. Muffin was a bit tough, but flavor wasn't too bad. Fruit was plentiful and good. \n\nService was very slow, considering there were only about 4 tables in the entire restaurant. We really had to wave down the waitresses, who would be clumped together at the front every 5 minutes. \n\nI personally wouldn't like to come here again, but if I wanted steak and eggs at midnight for a cheap price and I was too drunk to mind how it tasted, mmm maybe.
1;"Interior is nice. Charming patio. Menu is nothing really unique.  I was disappointed that they only had regular coffee, no Americano's, not even an Espresso machine which seems odd this day and age for a \""Cafe\"". For not looking to busy, service was pretty slow. The roast beef and pastrami sandwiches were good. Server was very nice, but seemed like they were having major issues with the cooks in back getting things done right and in timely manner. No water at tables and took ages for unripe tomatoes. What sandwich place doesn't have Dijon?"
1;"Yeah, we caught them at a busy time, but server was over-compensating (with attitude) for lack of competence.  Food was okay, a bit greasy for such a hipster place.   Maybe other servers are less desperate, more efficient.  We came to spend money and have a good  time; they seemed put out because their place of business was crowded."
1;The music was good, but it felt too much like LA...aka unglamorous...and glamorousness is what we went to Vegas for
1;Long before I was YELPING (is that really a verb?) I went to this establishment. I must confess that I really did not remember the experience. \n\nSo with family in town, we decided to try it again. Before going, I read the reviews, I found myself confused with the mixed reviews. But after our experience, I now understand. \n\nThis restaurant is for Atmosphere only!!! If you want a good dinner or good steak, go somewhere else. \n\nNow there are two ways to eat at this establishment: \n\nFirst--- \nGo to the sit down restaurant portion. Order from menu. Have food delivered like normal. \n\nSecond-- \nSit out at patio yard in back. To get food, you must go to walk up window, order and have food brought out. I am not sure if menu for this is the same for restaurant or not?? \n\nNow tonight, the Saturday before Easter we went to dinner. Figuring that it would be busy, we tried to go early, 5:00. But getting there about 30 minutes late, found that the parking lot was already very full and patio area was packed. \n\nStill having some lucky family genes, we found a parking spot right in front and were able to get seated at table in restaurant side immediately. 5 minutes later, I don't think we would have been that lucky... \n\nSo when you see the reviews about parking and long waits, I understand their frustrations. \n\nThree of the four ordered Rib Eye steaks. The fourth a Jack Daniels Chicken. It is pretty tough to screw up a chicken breast so can't comment on that. However, the Rib Eye... Not worth the $18 price tag. Very POOR piece of meat and not cooked very well. I was up sold on the mushrooms, which were served on top. This did nothing to cover the poor quality of meat and poor cooking. \n\nNow I fancy myself a pretty good cook. I make a mean breakfast, do well on dinners, and do very well on the grill. So anytime I find myself thinking that I can do better at home, I know the food is not very good.... \n\nService was average. Not sure the waitress even gave us her name. And was clearly too busy, with too many tables to provide quality attention. \n\nMaybe on a different night when things are not as busy, it might be better. But if the cut of meat is the same quality, I don't care what you do to it, how good your service person is, or how many mushrooms you put on top, it will still taste bad.  It will never be worth the $18 price. \n\nThree steak dinners, one chicken dinner one alcoholic drink for each, no dessert... Total bill $118.00 including tip... NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI am sure the patio atmosphere would be very fun! Fires in pits, roasted marshmallows, and often times live music. So if you are looking for fun place to go with friends to enjoy an evening under stars, this might be the place. \n\nWant a good steak or other type meal... Go somewhere else...
2;Valle Luna bats .250.  Not high enough to put in the middle of the lineup (hell, probably not enough to even start), not low enough to send back down to AAA.  Completely average.  I'll admit, however, to frequenting the restaurant primarily for its bar which seemingly promotes about 17,696 drink specials and more on football sundays.  Other than that, there isn't really a whole lot to say one way or another.  Perhaps that says more than a lengthy review ever could...
2;"Imagine my surprise last fall seeing a sign that said \""Red Mango coming soon\"" on State St... in Madison. Ok. Wait, really? Random... Madison? A RED MANGO?!?!?!?!?! WHAT??! *quadruple takes* Needless to say, I was a weeeee bit excited. I've loved Red Mango since I was first introduced to it years ago, back in the motherland. I mean, fro-yo that's not too sweet, piled on with delicious toppings? What's not to love?!\n\nSerendipitously, I was also on that side of campus on the first day Red Mango actually opened in Madison. So. It's a bit small. And not surprisingly, overrun with fobs (yes, even within hours of its opening. In January. Pretty positive it was in the negs that day). But I was impressed to see pomegranate seeds available as a topping, along with pomegranate yogurt... Unfortunately, that machine wasn't up and running when I was in. Haven't been back since but can't wait to go back and try it. \n\nyessssssss. I'm totally drooling in anticipation."
2;"This used to be our birthday tradition. The first time that my husband and I came here together (I'd been coming for a few years prior.), we were here for a while. It's not that my husband hadn't had sushi before I came along, only that I actually broadened his food horizons. In addition to sushi (this is ok), there is a custom cooking section (good, but there is a slight wait time), hot foods like tempura (try the yams), stuffed shrimp (good), and teriyaki chicken (kind of fatty), a cold salad section like seaweed salad ( I love this salad) and a handful of others, the crab legs (better than most casino buffets- really favorful- we like to get a full plate of this) and full dessert section with ice cream, cheesecake bites, carrot cake bites, cookies, and candies (seriously you will want to try some of these delicious sweet things). Since there is a huge selection, it is hard not to find something for everyone.  \n\nSince I don't want to be sick and get rolled out of the restaurant, I pace myself. I only get what I really want and I save room for dessert- ice cream, of course! My rule is two plates of food. I want to be satisfied but I don't want to overdo it. I use the rule of moderation. \n\nThe service is excellent. The staff is very attentive and eager to please; filling drinks and taking the dirty dishes away. It's nice that there is a bathroom in the restaurant. There are numerous tvs all around and there is music playing (but you can't hear it if the place is pretty crowded).  Also, don't forget about the crab- it's really good. (We went to the one in Hawaii but were disappointed that it wasn't really all you can eat- there was a person handing out two pieces of crab legs.) In the beginning I wrote that this used to be our birthday tradtion- the birthday promotion used to be BOGO, but now, the promotion is BOGO, if there are six people in your party. In the AAA coupon book (AAA customers- you get this at the customer service desk, upon entering the center via the parking garage), there is a 10% off coupon and I believe that there is an ongoing Locals promotion, of 10% off.\n\nIn a world of mediocre casino buffets (Las Vegas, lets be honest), this is still better than many of the ones available (not worth the time or money). All things considered, it's also in a good location, the Miracle Mile Shops in the Planet Hollywood Casino."
3;Quivey's Grove covers a lot of of ground when it comes to dining options.  There are two seperate restaurants on the property, the Stone House and the Stable Grill, as well as an outdoor tent called the Paddock where there is a Friday fish fry and at other times picnics and barbeques.  I've been to Quivey's quite a few times and I've always been impressed by how well they pull off the different aspects of all of these options.  I personally prefer going to the Stable Grill for lunch, as this is a bit easier on the wallet.\n\nThe Stone House is a very old mansion that has been converted to a formal restaurant.  The entrees are all named after historical Wisconsin figures, as in the Dewey pork, named after the first state governor.  The walls are decorated with antiques and other historic relics from Wisconsin's past.  I recently had dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday, and we were seated in a small room on the second level, completely private and with a small window looking out to the lawn.  It was a great experience.  My meal (the aforementioned Dewey pork) was excellent, and I especially enjoyed the side salad with a citrus vinagrette and strawberry and apple slices.  On previous occasions I have always been seated downstairs in the main dining area since my grandmother doesn't handle steps all that well.  The prices for entrees here are certainly on the high side - mine was over $20 - but the service is impeccable and the atmosphere is well worth it for special occasions.  The only drawback to the evening was my drink - too light on the J&B and too heavy on the water.  Also, the Stone House is the only part of Quivey's that takes reservations.\n\nThe Stable Grill is a much more affordable option for repeated visits.  The building is a renovated barn and the decor keeps with theme.  Some of the tables are made of old wagon wheels.  It's a livelier place, and on weekends a piano player is in the bar (he happens to be a UW professor and I took one of his classes my last semester).  The entrees and sandwiches are named after local towns, and both the lunch and dinner menus are well balanced.  I especially like the Middleton perch filets and Paoli beef tenderloin.  The prices are a step lower here, and there are nightly specials for each day.  My favorite is the Monday tenderloin special.\n\nThere is also an outdoor element to Quivey's in the form of a big tent in the lawn in front of the Stable Grill.  On Friday nights there is a fish fry special and this is where to bring kids because there are plenty of games and room to run around.  Businesses or groups can also rent this out for lunch picnics or barbeques, and there are sometimes weddings done out on the lawn.  I've been to a barbecue put on by a vendor and it was really well done.  There was pulled pork and smoked brisket sandwiches with Spotted Cow.  An acquaintance of mine had a wedding here too.  I didn't go, but mutual friends have always told me it was a success despite a little inclement weather.    Lastly, there is a beer tasting festival that happens in September.  It's been a favorite of a couple friends of mine and I'm looking forward to going this year.
3;This is a very nice, informal, trattatoria style Italian Restaurant in the Aria Hotel section of City Center. We had a large party and the staff quickly pushed three tables together to accommodate us. \n\nThey must have worked out the bugs because, unlike other reviews here, the service and food were excellent. \n\nWe started with apps. We went for the seafood platter and finished it off with a couple of entries of the fresh made pasta with meat sauce that they divided into app portions. The shrimp on the platter were a little overcooked and rubbery, but the oysters were very good--just the right hint of salt. \n\nFor the entre, I threw the crew a curve ball and they hit it out of the park! I asked if they could make Veal Saltombocca since they had all the ingredients listed on otter dishes. I got a thumbs up after the waiter checked with the kitchen. IT WAS GREAT! Not as good as Piero's, but excellent non the less. \n\nEveryone else in the group also agreed that their food was very good to excellent and we all raved about how well the service went. It was a fabulous meal. \n\nIt will be seen how well this restaurant does--along with the several others around it. The crowd on this Wednesday night was okay. The crowds at City Center in general were light. \n\nI would give this place a shot. Very good!
1;"Bought a groupon today, $15 for 30. Went to Stacy's at lunch & had my print out. Right away the gentleman behing the tall counter asked if that was a Groupon. I said yes, then he said very rudely \""Oh we aren't taking those until Monday\"". I said what. He said Yeah we ain't taking those till Monday. I said it doesn't say it on the Groupon. He said Yeah not till Monday. I was like are you serious, he said Yeah, that's coming from the higher up's. \n\nI chuckled and said ok. I mean if you are putting a Groupon out then you need to specify in the fine print a \""start date\"". We ended up sitting down for lunch and two other people came in with their Groupon. They were told the same thing, also in a rude manner. One gentleman was furious and stated the same thing I said, \""it doesn't say that\"". \n\nThe food was good, as this was my first time there. I had the lunch special, pulled pork sandwhich with potato salad. BUT.... the mac & cheese was NOT worth the $4 for an 8oz size. It tasted and looked like mac & cheese out of a box, like Kraft. That was very disappointing. Will I go back? Heck yeah, to redeem my Groupon, but after that, not really."
1;The Whiskey gingerale is delicious but beware the french fries are absolutely horrible!! absurd amounts of salt!
1;DISAPPOINTED! I had previously read a lot of reviews talking about how great breakfast was here, so when I found myself at MB around dinner time thought I would pop in and check out the place. The price was $35 for dinner, which is average for a Vegas buffet. HOWEVER, this has to be one of the smallest buffets in town. Despite being disappointed in the size, I was hopeful what food they did have would be amazing..... WRONG. The only thing I really enjoyed was the salad, and I made that myself. The only saving grace for this place, the staff is super friendly and the dessert bar is pretty tasty. Definitely won't be returning. My suggestion, if you are looking for a good buffet take your money elsewhere on the strip.
1;The atmosphere is absolutely amazing! The food on the other hand not so much.. We try the four course tasting menu for 90 bucks and we did the wine pairing for an extra 30. 1.Salad was ok 2. Scallops favored really well. 3. Salmon I did not care for it. The pea guacamole was a little lumpy I like it a little smoother. 4. Mini dessert duo (DE creme and mixed berries) ok.....\nHe had the  1. Lobster Bisque 2. Scallops 3. Center cut steak (loved it) 4. Mini dessert duo.\n\nNot sure if it was just us but he felt a little woozy once the room stopped rotating (after midnight i think) so we didn't go to the lounge. Went downstairs to play a little.  And once we got in the cab both of us felt very dizzy. Really weird because I never get motion sickness. \nIf they change the menu/ chef I would love to try it again but if not I'll pass.
0;"This has nothing to do with the Pharmacy side...Basically in line to checkout with only one register open.  I'm not sure if it was the manager or not but he called for Photo (whoever the person to come)....instead the gal at the makeup counter says I'm open here....Later I hear the photo gal say the same...\n\nIMPROPER TRAINING YOU BUFFOON!!!!!!\nYou don't leave customers waiting in line and haphazardly say come here!  You say \""NEXT CUSTOMER IN LINE\"" and if they decide to go or not that makes the difference!\n\nIDIOTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4;This is got to be the best Mexican restaurant on the west side. Their food is great to have a great selection this service is superior. The decor is absolutely Mexican style. And they have the best margaritas I've had.
1;My wife and I stopped by the other day for lunch. The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. The staff was friendly but not very knowledgeable of the menu.\nMy wife ordered the Fish Tacos and was very disappointed. It came on flour tortillas with no option for corn tortillas (the only way to make authentic fish tacos). The fish was bland and did not have a crunchy or crisp coating. When she ordered she specifically asked for extra crispy. She even asked the server to take it back to the kitchen to make it crispier but the server returned telling her the cook refused and said that's as crispy as it's gonna get.\nI ordered the Chicken Philly which was OK. The chicken was kind of bland and the Hoagie Roll was cold. It would have been nice if it was warmed and toasted.\nHopefully they will improve their cooking methods but chances are we won't be going back any time soon.
0;Who answers the phone at this place?....I had to hang up on the same person on two different occasions. Hard to believe this person is still employed. He had a very difficult  time with simple things such as spelling and pronunciation.... this got old and annoying very quickly!\nI could not make it through the whole conversation....not even past the part where I was trying to give him my address..he could not even handle that... twice!...This guy is surely doing nothing but damage to business at this location.....If anybody cares, he last answered my call on Friday night, Nov 22, 2013\nPlease fire this moron so I can have some pizza...until then I shall take my business elsewhere.\nI suggest somebody in management calls on his shift and poses as a customer, so they can see that this review is no exaggeration by any means.\nSign him up for the special olympics.
2;My boyfriend and I recently purchased a Groupon for Havana Cafe since I've been wanting to take him there for quite some time. It was a $15 groupon for $35 worth of food, a pretty good deal! We were excited. \n\nWe sat down for an early dinner, around 6pm. Using the term greeted would be generous, so I'll just say that an older man came to our table and set 2 waters down without saying hello or how are you or anything. It's a small restaurant but there were only about 3 other tables with patrons in the restaurant. 15 minutes later he comes back with menus and asks if we want anything else to drink, I say just water for now because we had just gotten the wine menu. He proceeds to take our drink menus so I ended up just sticking with water. \n\nFinally, another waitress comes to take our food order. I show her the groupon to make sure it's okay to use it on that time and day (a lot of places won't let you use them during happy hour). She looks at it strangely and just walks off with it? She looked really annoyed. We got our Black Bean Fritters and Calamari appetizers. Both were so amazing. We were really blown away. For our main entree we ordered the seafood paella which was equally amazing, if not better. Although my boyfriend who has had paella on many occasions, thought it needed more saffron. I thought it was just fine. The seafood was really fresh and I think more saffron would have drowned out other flavors. \n\nWe ordered the mini caramel flan for dessert. It came out maybe 2 minutes after we ordered it so it's by no means fresh or prepared. I thought the caramel on it was bitter and I didn't finish it. \n\nOverall, the food here is amazing, definitely worth going for. I was really disappointed by the service. The staff seemed to be annoyed with our groupon usage which made me feel uncomfortable. The place itself is pretty quaint and nice. It doesn't seem very popular with younger people but maybe that's because of the service.
0;DO NOT COME HERE ! Unless you want to get taken for a fool.\n\nIts been a couple days since we went there and I am STILL pissed.  \n\nFood is great, a carb overload but very satisfying! \n\nCustomer service... cashier... manager...  THEY DONT GAVE A DAM what you want... only what they can up sale you!  I went here and ordered a large combo with fries and a coke... for about 12 bucks... What I ended up paying was almost 18 bucks.\n\nNo I didn't notice how much until after I sat down and actually looked at my receipt ... yes dumb on my part but I was a little distracted with my drinking...  Any who I go up to the cashier and tell him that what I was charged was NOT what I ordered... This was before meal was prepared so I was sure it wouldn't be hard to correct... the cashier looked me right in the face and said I know that is not what you ordered but its better!\n\nSo the cashier  calls the manager over and HE tells me that he would not give me a refund that I was be happy with what I ordered. I argued that I didn't want double patty, too much food, just give me my money back ill go else where and he would not budge. He kept saying the burgers are so good that I would be grateful with the extra large meal, shake  ( it was good but I didn't need to mix shake with BEER gross plus I didn't order it). Needless to say I didn't want to start a scene since the MANAGER was the one telling the cashiers to pretty much rob us blind and I was drinking.. \n\nI just wanted to throw my pennies at that man and tell him he needed change more then I did... NEVER GOING BACK... \n\nFood however was great :(
3;"I won't say it's the best Thai in Las Vegas, because it's more of a fusion than authentic Thai (the distinction of \""Best Authentic Thai\"" belongs to Lotus of Siam, on Sahara). However, the service is friendly, the cocktails are strong, and the crab rangoons are some of the best I've ever had. This is one of my favorite dinner spots for catching up with friends. Will return again and again."
4;Meat toting gauchos! Seriously, If you have not experienced Gauchos bringing you meat on a spit, you have not yet lived as a carnivore! Service has always been great when we've been there, and the food is delish!
2;Maybe I missed something but this place just didn't wow me. It was around lunch time when we went and the place was almost empty. The set up was just awkward since it is such a small narrow space. We walked in from the parking lot and couldn't quite figure out where to go because there was no one around. The outside patio looked great but it was far too hot, maybe it'll be nicer in the cooler months(or month). The place has character, I'll give it that, but comes across as what an interior designer would consider coastal not quite a laid back beach taco place. We ordered a cheese tortilla with shrimp as an appetizer, it was delicious. The fish tacos were just okay. The mahi mahi taco was good but they were pretty bland with the tiniest amount of mango salsa. For a fish taco company I was expecting more, especially for the price.
2;I like this place. Great drinks and interesting food. This place has proved you can put any meal into a burrito and make it taste good. \n\n2 cons: \nThe outside bar is separate from the inside bar.\nThe outside bar has all the good drinks but attracts a horrible crowd \n\nThe outside bar is nicer and has more to offer. The inside bar is pretty much like a pricey dive bar. I wish they could combine the two.
0;Last night's attempt at dining at Vito's will be our last.  We had previously visited Vito's on a consistent basis (initially, at least once or twice per week) for drinks, appetizers, and/or dinner at the bar.  While the food is only of mediocre quality, the convenience offered by a location so close to home seemed to compensate for this factor as well as the cramped quarters at the bar and the seemingly perpetual presence of at least one or two loud, obnoxious patrons who repeatedly made their sojourns to the parking lot only to return reeking of cigarette smoke.  More recently, our visits became a bit less frequent due to the increasing filth present on the bar.  The last few times we visited, we entered to find only one or two patrons at the bar, but the entire rest of the bar occupied by other customers' dirty dishes that had not been cleared.  While the staff would quickly clear enough space for us to sit down, the dishes would be removed, but no effort was ever made to wipe away the food that was caked to the bar.  Glancing around, however, the reason for the staff's lack of attention to waiting on actual customers typically became readily apparent due to the presence of her Royal Majesty, the owner, perched in a prime booth with her entourage demanding the majority of the staff's time and efforts at the expense of the paying customers.  On numerous occasions, we sat with empty glasses for 10-15 minutes while the staff chatted with and tended to the owner and her royal court.\n\nWhile the convenience factor allowed us to tolerate these issues, the failure of a restaurant to remain open during its posted hours is a fatal error.  We arrived to dine at Vito's last night only to be informed by the bartender that the restaurant had closed A FULL 45 MINUTES PRIOR TO THEIR POSTED TIME.  Customers rely on the hours that a business states that it will be open when making plans and a failure to remain open for business until such a time presents an inconvenience significant enough that we will not burden this establishment with our patronage again.  Vito's may not care about the time customers must waste driving to a different restaurant when they had planned on stopping in for a convenient meal, but I can assure them that we will not risk the aggravation of the time wasted on a Sunday evening with a long week of work looming on the horizon.  Bye, bye Vito's.  We won't miss you.
0;This is just very bad bbq and poor service.   I have given it several chances and nothing has changed.   Will not be going back.
4;This is by far my favorite place for Italian food in the Queen City. I was born in Brooklyn, NY, and every time my mother visits, she insists we go to Portofino's at least once. The service is fantastic and the food is authentic Italian (again, that's coming from the mouth of a New Yorker!). The Chicken Parm is my go-to dish -- my ultimate comfort food. Overall, I'd highly recommend this spot if you're in need of good food. Period.
0;--LOOK AT MY PICTURE!!! \n\nThis is a picture of an **INSECT that I was about to eat!! I was really hungry and decide to stop by and eat.. Thank goodness this was my second plate and I wasn't too full because I gulped down the first plate..

0;"FYI Suzanne's Bridal Boutique in Gilbert is by far the absolute worst place I have ever stepped foot in! Yes the dresses are pretty but seriously their service is worse than horrible!!! They have terrible customer service. They are by far the rudest people I have ever met. The charge hundreds of dollars more for dresses that you can buy online for next to nothing. ANNNDDDDDD they have the worst alterations, they truly are pathetic! The faberic was coming apart and had to get them to fix it, but worst of all was the corset they put in this dress was off by a half an inch on one side. Their way of explaining it was \""oh you just pull it tighter\"" REALLY?!? Seriously save yourself the time, money, and frustration GO ANYWHERE BUT HERE! Shopping for your wedding dress is supposed to be a happy time not a time where you are to be treated with 0 respect."
4;We love this place! The service is great and the food even better. We really like their Meet the Meat Calzone! It's usually busy at dinner time and you could wait up to 40 minutes, but it is worth it!
1;The space, Sparce, with a counter for taking orders and some outdoor seating and indoor seating.\nA few obligatory tourist posters are on the wall, as well as a TV blaring Fox news at a slightly higher volume than I would like. Not ear splitting, but it was pretty loud.\n\nBut the main thing, is the food.\n\nSad to say, it was pretty run of the mill, and even though it's only their first week open, I'm still not holding out a lot of hope.\nI ordered a Gyro Plate and The Bride ordered a falafel plate.\nThe gyro meat tasted like any I could have had at numerous food courts in any mall across the country. the cries were nice, and the pita bread was fresh.\nthe one weird thing was that even though it came with a salad, and the salad had a little bit of feta (I forgot to ask for extra feta, since i love the stuff!) there was NO DRESSING on either of our salads, its almost as if.. well, greek salads didnt need dressing here or something, very odd.\n\nMy Brides Falafel was better, not much better than a boxed mix you can get at Fry's, but still a decent portion, and it tasted fine. Her hummus tasted fine, about the same as you can get at Costco, but with a bit more lemon than I like. (personal preference here)\nI might go back in a month or so and see how their Kabobs are, though the whole meal tasted rather pre-fab which breaks my heart. I was so looking forward to a good Mom and Pop gyro place close by. \nThe portions were nice though, and the people were friendly. \nPerhaps given time they will improve.\nCurrently they don't deliver, and to me, that's really their only hope for survival with so many apartments in the area.\nHope others have better experiences!
1;We had a going away part here last night, and even if we weren't leaving the state, wouldn't go back. We brought a lot of business and our server refused to split our check, so we were having to go up to the bar to purchase (not cheap) drinks, where the bartender was so busy looking at his cell phone he couldn't pay attention to the fact that we were trying to order, and was rude once we actually got his attention. Service - poor. Food - ok, needless to say we ended up taking the party somewhere else.
0;"The Spicery, a quaint home steeped in beauty and history.  I've been a resident of Arizona since 1977, and watched this adorable home transition over the decades, frequenting it as a customer over the last two.\n\nFirst off, I called weeks in advance to get a seating for four on Mother's Day.  I was told that The Spicery was closed on Sundays, and just because it's Mother's Day...they weren't going to be open. So I make a reservation for Monday, May 13th for a tea for four.\n\nWhen we arrived for our 1:00 PM seating, we were told that we did not make the correct reservation, that because we did not give notice for a \""HIGH\"" tea, that we were stuck with the normal lunch menu.  I had made it very clear that we wanted a \""tea\"" for four.  Second disappointment.\n\nThen when we went to order, everything we wanted was not available.  The restarant had been opened only two and a half hours since being closed the previous day, and they had \""no soup\"" and \""no potato salad\"".  When asked what type of teas were available, I was told there was ice tea and lemonade.  Our waitress, dressed in a too small tank top and yoga pants had no knowledge of the menu.  Sweet girl but I can only assume she was very new.\n\nI ordered the broccoli and cheddar quiche, which was less than an inch thick, and had ONE floret of almost brown, shriveled broccoli.  The flat, flavorless quiche was filled with lots of chopped celery and onions.  Almost NO broccoli and very little cheddar.  I believe that was a store-bought crust.  It truly tasted like it.\n\nFor dessert, I ordered a creme puff, which was black around the edges.  This delicate pastry had been burned.   The egg-laden custard however was delicious.\n\nThis once quaint, exceptional tea house that had us drooling over their delicate finger sandwiches, delectable desserts and teas with notes of spices and fruits...was a massive let down.  There were so many disappointments that there was no way to save the experience for four women scraping the egg custard from a burnt cream puff.  We would have had a better experience going to a chain like IHOP or Denny's."
0;"BIG MISTAKE.\n\nIt's really simple. I specifically asked the lady to just clean up around my sideburns, ears, and the back of my neck. I said \""I do not want a haircut. Just clean up around the edges.\n\nShe did the exact opposite. She cut everywhere! I have super uneven side sideburns...in fact, the haircut itself is totally uneven from side to side.\n\nAlso, 2 of the 3 ladies working there barely spoke english. NEVER GOING BACK.\n\nWORST haircut experience I've even had."
4;What a great experience. \n\nDon't miss out on the Mirror Maze and the Laser Maze Challenge. All off are boys and girls loved challenging each other for the best time through the Laser Maze\n\nWe all also spent about a half hour going through the Mirror Maze having a great time.\n\nWe've kept going back time after time after time.
2;I want to give this 3 1/2 stars. I really think this is a typical seafood restaraunt. I had a halibut dish and it was average. It didn't explode in my mouth, so I can't really rate this place high.\n\nTheir service was great though. We had a birthday dinner for a friend and she was surprised with a nice big dessert that all of us shared. The thing I like about this place is it is quiet even though its in the middle of the walkway between Venetian and Palazzo.\n\nGood Friends always can make up for good food. Good conversation can always make good friends, best friends!
4;Delicious! Not only are the deep dish pizzas great but the thin crust pizzas are also amazing.
2;I guess you can certainly do worse.. , after awhile all these shitholes look the same to me, I go for the experience of talking to the locals, and , on this day my better half and I were the only 2 customers in this place. We had a serviceable Philly Cheese Steak. Prices are average I guess. And I have to give it one star for the stupid name.
4;A lot of people say lawyers are like sharks, but I wouldn't say that about Aaron Kelly. He's more like a bear - warm and fuzzy, but fierce when necessary.\n\nI consult with a variety of clients on internet marketing topics, and I don't hesitate to call on Aaron Kelly for questions about relevant laws and emerging areas of concern to my clients. He knows his stuff, and he's an all-around pleasant guy to deal with. I can't comment on his partner, but the guy can't be all bad if he works with Aaron.\n\nAs an example, I have one client in the online dating industry. Because they work with numerous third-party marketing partners (affiliates), I called on Aaron to do a brief call with the client and myself to go over things they can do to minimize their liability. Not only did he answer all their questions, but he also gave me a great recommendation for a donut place next time I'm in Austin.
2;There are good things about this place.  It is a great place to watch a game and the staff seems to care.  The menu is good and the food seems flavorful for a bar. My problem with this place is the last few times we have been there, the food is cold coming to my table.  I hate cold food.
2;I got no hate for Tim Hortons!  This place offered up fast and what tasted pretty healthy sammies.  Not bad when you're searching for a quick bite to eat.
1;Normally I don't review places like this but as it was important for our trip to come here, I figured I would post a review. My friend was in from out of town and we made an impromptu trip to Vegas for the weekend. He didn't have any dress clothes so we lender him clothes but we still had no dress shoes so we didn't plan on going clubbing. We ended up getting on the guest list for pure at Caesars (read my review) and we needed to get him dress shoes. We came here and got a nice pair for $30 and now he has a pair to leave in town for if we make another impromptu trip. The selection is standard with every other Ross I have been to so it didn't seem anything special, but the reason I rated it 2 stars is because of the staff. Checkout takes forever because the cashiers take their sweet time to check stuff out and they only have 4 check stands open for the line of like 25 people. And then they work slower than molasses flowing uphill. It took us like 30 minutes to finally get checked out\n\nIt works out if you are in a snag and need to get something, but leave time to get your stuff cause it will take you a while
0;Called to make a reservation for 5pm, i was told not possible but 5:30 would be ok. When we arrived there were only 3 tables seated so why act like your booked up. we order food from the non-legibly speaking female waitress that had no recommendations on food nor opinions. we ordered edema-me for a quick starter, they came totally wilted and soggy, I then ordered the BBQ ribs with the sauce on the side. Ribs came colder than luke warm and had the sauce on it not on the side as requested (sent that and the edema-me back). My girlfriend ordered her favorite fish (Sea Bass) that came out looking like the picture but to fish lovers like us this fish had a texture you would find in imitation crab meat. We did not finish one entire bite.\nthey asked if we wanted anything else of coarse but to be told that this restaurant is top 10 in the country????, i dont think so. the Ice tea however was deliscious!!
0;If you want to be completely ignored when you walk into a business, then this is the place for you. I walked into this bakery at 4:40PM. There were 2 customers ahead of me and 2 ladies behind the counter. One was waiting on the customers while the other\nseemed to be more interested in getting the place ready for closing at 5:00PM and\nsocializing with someone who walked in after me and was obviously just visiting the lady. The other lady finished with her customer and then walked back to the back of the store and they both completely ignored me for a good 5 minutes while I was waiting by the cake case too buy a cake. Ten minutes later I finally asked them exactly how much longer they were going to ignore me and walked out. I them came back to ask for the owner's name and was told it was Ron. Well Ron, this incident cost you $17.99 which I was going to spend on a Tiramasu cake and also lost you a good customer. I also plan to tell my family and friends NOT to shop here. TERRIBLE SERVICE.
3;My coworker and I just left there. It was my first time trying this place and it was pretty good. I checked it out online before I went and people compared it to In N Out. To, me The Habit is better by far especially their fries. My burger was a little pink inside but not enough to make a fuss about.  The only drawback today was the landscapers. Seemed like everytime I started talking, he'd fire up the saw he was using lol.  Will definitely eat here again.
1;"It was our first time there with my fiance and the service was horrid. We heard nothing more than \""do you know what you want\"" to take our order and \""are you all finished\"" after. No hello, have you been here before, welcome anything like that. The food was great, but service ruined the night. Won't be back, ever. Too Many good Italian places with good service."
0;No beef ribs? Forget it, this ain't a Q place.\n\nWhere are the guys chopping hickory? How do they actually smoke anything?\n\n$$$ to high for a hole in the wall prefab Q place.\n\n(Sort of an update) My wife said the above was unfair if I had not even tried the food so she brought me some to make an informed opinion. So here it is:\n\nThe brisket was dry and the smoke taste was I think injected, I could not locate a smoke ring. The ribs were drown in sauce and for good reason, the hog was overcooked, sad. The sides were nothing to cheer about, I have had better beans and slaw from Walmart, and that is truly sad. \n\nThe original single star is exactly the same after eating the food. I may have made some assumptions based on what i saw when I walked in the first time, but I seem to have been right. Still looking for great Q in Vegas. (There is good Q, but still looking for great Q.)
3;We found this place on groupon and the food was excellent! The service was a little slow and the overall decor of the restaurant was a little dated. But the food was good. We will be back!
0;I am writing this review based on the customer service as I did not have the opportunity to try the food. A party of 7 joined for dinner and we did not have a reservation. The only table that was immediately available was outside and with it being 6:00 and 100 degrees we decided to wait the estimated wait time of 45 to 60 minutes. After over an hour and fifteen minute wait and multiple requests for a estimated time that our table would be ready we were approached with a table that was ready. Okay finally right? No, the table was ready but it was indeed outside. WTF? We were just sitting outside at the fire pits drinking from their bar waiting for that table inside. Our first reaction of course was are you kidding me? We could have been eating over an hour ago. They offered us free desert but explained the tables inside were all reserved for the night (Sunday night). We felt extremely taken advantage of while running up a bar tab that we of course were required to pay for, manager came out to apologize but it was indeed too late. Would not return even if the meal was paid for. Too many options in a beautiful city. I would not recommend this restaurant if you are a walk in, or looking for quality customer service.
2;"Subway, your bread's trying to hard to please.\nYour meat is okay, but you skimp on the cheese.\nSome girl who just started thinks \""pickles\"" means twenty.\nMy sandwich was briney, I swear six was plenty.\nBut I did like the apples and unsweetened iced tea,\nWhich helped cut out the fat and empty calories.\nNo you still aren't my fave and you never will be.\nBut at least you aren't trying to \""Super Size\"" me."
2;"I have heard a lot about this place and really had high hopes. I would have given it more stars but the service was effing horrendous. To the point where I almost got up and walked out. The waitress our table had (a small table of THREE girls) dropped off teh menu and avoided ALL EYE CONTACT for about an hour. She waited all the other tables around us and behind us and even BESIDE us but ours seemed to be an impossibility. After finally giving our order and getting our BOTCHED plates (I had ordered the beef poutine and got a regular one, which they still charged me $18), it took another 20 minutes to get ANOTHER waitress to our table to try and fix the mistake. All this and we haven't been able to place the drink orders because our waitress RAN AWAY after we gave our food order.\nThe food itself was TO DIE FOR (once we got our full plates). The blue cheese and beef poutine is heavenly, the mayo they give you seems to be home-made and they burgers.... mmmmmmmmm.\nI wish i can give one rating for the service and another for the food. Going into a pub, i'm not looking for fantastic service however I'm not looking to go behind the bar and get my drinks either. I don't know if this woman was in her \""monthly\"" time or what but let me tell you, she was unhappy with life and seemed to have a hatred for our table.\nThis being said, AVOID the tall waitress with super short bleached hair because if she's in a bad mood, you'll leave there in a bad mood too but definitely go to try that poutine!!!! And the cucumber gin & tonic... Mmmmmmmmmm..."
4;Yes its a chain but for the money, this place is one of the best chain restaurants if not the best I know of.  The wait staff is great and good looking and the food is awesome and priced well.
4;Been meaning to write this review for a couple weeks now.  I live in San Diego but I have a tenant in a condominium I own in Las Vegas on Flamingo road.  AC broke down on him.  Knowing things like that could be expensive and worried someone might try to rip me off since I'm not physically there,  I got on Yelp to find out who's got the good reviews.  They were able to get out that day in which they gave a free estimate.  The price was right, very fair for what was wrong and the amount of time it was going to take, so I gave them the go ahead and tenant is happy again.  If you want honest, fair, quality service give these guys a call.  Highly recommend.
3;Three words.  Black truffle mayo!!  Omg!  Love love love!  The prime rib sandwich was amazing!!!!!!  Biggest serving of sliced prime rib, your choice of bread, and two sauces!  Definitely get the black truffle mayo!!  The fondue was good too!  A friend of mine also highly recommends the horseradish!!  I'm usually not big on sandwiches at dinnertime, but I definitely would order that again!!  For appetizers, we did the oast duck buns!!!  Awesome!!  And this chick is not a beer drinker but I had to do the fruit and chocolate beer sampler!  Yup.... Beer that tasted like fruit and chocolate!  Uh, the chocolate, not so good.  But the raspberry and peach beer.... Tasted like juice!!! Fun atmosphere, good food, good service!!
1;The best part about this place?  Their super yummy seafood salad.\n\nThe worst part?  Their AWFUL service.\n\nIchabod's is near my work so I have been here several times for lunch and every time we've had bad service.  We almost always have to wave someone down to get a refill on our water, and getting the check can sometimes take 20 minutes.\n\nIf you have an hour lunch... you can expect to use the whole hour, and you might even be late.  \n\nCome on, Ichabod's... get your act together.  Your food's pretty decent and you could have a good lunch crowd if your service didn't suck.
2;Lunch was alright. Good food but very small portion. It was a restaurant week deal so may be that is why. Food was not bad. I expected it to be in the same league as Craft or Jean George but it was not. Food was pretty decent little above average but not spectacular as the top ones.
2;Solid Asian restaurant in the MGM.  It's open late and has a decent sushi menu and very good mixed drinks.
2;"I have lived in Madison, Wisconsin for many years, and had never even \""noticed\"" the Big Ten Pub.  Driving by one Friday early evening my wife and I stopped in.  Very busy.  Very noisy.  EXTREMELY pleasant and helpful wait staff.  The chicken chili is the berst I've ever enjoyed.  Fish fry was very well done, and the potato pancakes were exceptional.  There is one turn-off however that may prevent from going back - -it may be a \""small thing,\"" but to me it is important.  I have never, EVER been in a restaurant that made a charge for an extra small cup of tartar sauce, or sour cream.  NEVER! That says a lot to me about \""attitude\"" - -my server explained as best he could, and I recognize it is not the server's fault.  It seems to me that the owner -- \""Jordan\"" - -or management should IMMEDIATELY provide someone spending a minimum of $30-$40 per couple with an extra doo-dad or these sauces without charge and without question!  I run a business, and I've found that if I did something like this my clientele/customers would be rightfully outraged.  Good place, but this bothers me greatly.\nRay from Madison"
1;Couldn't wait to try this new restaurant. My friend and I first ordered a crab stuffed portabello mushroom -- delicious and rich. Our big disappointment came with the Betty's signature salad, which contained mixed greens, candied nuts, pears and gorgonzola. The pears were canned! To me, a restaurant serving pears from a can is unacceptable.\nI really wanted to like this place, but doubt I will go back.
0;I bought the extra coverage to cover your lenses in case something happens to them\n My wife's lens was scratched and they do not want to honor ... \n  Now are they want to charge us for scratched lenses \n   After that we paid an expensive price we can find  ones for a lot cheaper \n  Now I was going to be two weeks before we get the new lenses in\n This place is a rip off don't go
0;I'm really bummed to have a negative attitude about this place. My dog may not be the easiest to groom and barks when he is nervous and uncomfortable. But being in a grooming business I would assume that this is expected out of some dogs and is something that you should be skilled to handle. The lady that groomed him, unfortunately she never introduced herself so I don't even know her name, called me when my dog was being close to finished and added he was causing a lot of noise. When I arrived to pick him up she ended up telling me he was not welcomed back because of his barking. He is a dog and dogs bark, is my thought when she said this. She made it very uncomfortable at this point and continued on to say she wasn't able to cut his nails or trim around his face. I was still charged full price. My dog has been groomed 10 or more times since he was a puppy and this is the first time anyone has complained this much about him. Most groomers would joke and say he sang to them during his groom and that he was a sweet boy. I'm not sure what was so different with this groomer and why she only had negative things to say about him. Which made me sad to hear. I was really excited about this place because it was close to my house and has such great reviews. I was going to schedule my other 2 dogs to have a groom as well but unfortunately I'll have to look elsewhere because of my experience I had today. I wish I had better things to say but I'm just really disappointed.
3;"I went here as a part of the vegan meetup group. \n\nFood was excellent. Dinner included one of the best soups I can remember having (some kind of spicy split pea with an incredible depth of flavor) and a zesty, minty salad drizzled in olive oil. Main courses were a) some kind of zucchini in an oily tomato sauce, b) fava bean stew, c) falafel with hummus, and d) some kind of spinach/ phyllo dish. There was also pita served with the meal.  The zucchini had a great flavor, and while oily, it was not a bad \""oily.\"" I'm not sure that I would want to eat a whole plate of it but, alongside the rest of the food it had a very fresh, very delicious flavor. The fava beans were by far the best entree, a salty and smoky stew that was very hearty. The spinach pie was definitely an acquired taste--some kind of exotic flavor within the filling that was hard to place and which my girlfriend did not care for--but I ate two helpings. The falafel was amazing, very crisp outside and moist, well-seasoned inside. Maybe as good as Bunky's. \n\nWe were also served a delicious baklava dessert, although the coffee was sadly a bit burnt. My girlfriend had the tea, however, which she described as excellent. \n\nThe service was very good--extremely attentive and willing to please, almost excessively so. It has a much nicer atmosphere inside than you would expect from the strip-mall interior. \n\nAll in all, very good food. Would recommend."
4;It truly saddens me to see such bad reviews for this place. My family has been taking our beloved animals here since 1993 when a breeder recommended them to us. Dr. Anderson is amazing, he tells it how it is and never tries to sell you procedures or stuff he doesn't think your animal needs. He has saved my cats life twice. After moving to Phoenix my cat got real sick with a uti, called around to vets near me and they wanted to charge me about 5 times what Anderson did... Needless to say I drove clear out to Tempe. The place can get a bit busy but you know that is a good sign! Please check out this vet for yourself. The prices are beyond fair and dr. Anderson is amazing.
0;came in at 10:30 waited 10 minutes for someone from the talkative crew in the back to take our order. \na pissed off manager by the name of Alicia comes to the front insisting they've stopped cooking and I insisted we came in 10 minutes ago but no one was willing to even acknowledge us.... while profanity is heard from the kitchen regarding their teenage angst. \n honey I've ordered from pizza Hut five minutes before they close,  I'm familiar with the drill. \nafter a brief argument which she lost  she was the utmost reluctant to take my order. bad service and rude faces.
2;Poor old style interior . The restaurant looks run down & depressed . Poor selection of paint on the walls , ceiling was badly run down ... Service was poor as well , the guy taking care of tables didn't smile a single time we were there . May be he is not really from food industry and this thing  is new to him . I suggest owner/manager of this place to work on interior & service .. Food was decent , for 6.99 buffet variety of food was good . Veggie biryani wasn't authentic and lacked taste . Garlic naan was just average . Gulab Jamun & kaddi were only 2 items that I felt were great in taste rest were all average and lacked authenticity . This can be a good restaurant only if they work on interior & service . Overall 3.5
4;My experience at Makers and Finders was great! The food is phenomenal and their coffee is one of a kind. If you're looking for a place that brews coffee in 30 seconds, this isn't the place for you. You come for the experience and the many varieties that have to offer. I had their horchata mixed with expresso and was blown away by the flavor. I can't wait to return again for the breakfast!
1;"My group and I were left completely unimpressed by this place. Speaking for myself, I was expecting more since this place has \""Wolfgang Puck\"" as a prefix in it's name. \n\nThe server was nice, although I forgot her name. The food took for-ev-errrrrrr to get out to us. The eggplant parmesan (my dish) was a-ok. My cousin had the mushroom pizza, which was OK, as well. I am a huge fan of arugula and when her pizza came out, the mushroom was baked within the pizza as it usually is, and the arugula was just sprinkled on top with what looked like olive oil sprinkled over it. She wasn't happy. I think she was expecting it to be baked with the whole pizza, but whatever. I ate it all anyway. Another one of my friends ordered a pepperoni pizza sub pepperoni for chicken, because they don't pork. The server was kind enough to do that, however failed to tell her that there would be an extra charge for chicken. One would think since you're subbing the item, it would be an equal exchange if you weren't notified of a price difference. We didn't want to complain or argue, so we just paid the difference and left it at that.\n\nEveryone left the restaurant unhappy and with complaints. Bad sign. We probably won't come here again next time."
3;Overall the Discount Tire chain is the only place I'd go for tires and tire-related services, but this location was a little disappointing on my recent visit.  They took double the time they estimated to mount four tires.  If they'd just given me an accurate time estimate, I would have re-booked a meeting I had afterward.  I was late and had to give last-minute notice.  I'll continue to use the chain, but will avoid this location in the future.
2;Went there for a business lunch.  Was typical. Nothing special
3;This is my second time here. The first time I had it was in North Carolina. This Golden Corral has a very long wait time with a huge line out the door. The wait can be up to two hours. The food is pretty good in terms of quality. Not everything is good but a majority of it is. Their seafood is cooked to order although too much butter is used in the sauce. Their steaks are grilled to order too so you can get either medium rare all the way to well done. The food is very fresh. The desserts are high quality too and there is a good diversity to them. The price is not bad for dinner at $11.49 (not including drinks) for so much food diversity. Definitely want to come back.
4;You'll see me at Lola at least a couple mornings a week, sometimes practically every day of the week.\n\nI only order the Cafe Latte, but given how good it is, everything else must be good too!  The scones are unbelievably good.  There must be some voodoo in them to make them taste that way - flaky and moist at the same time, just the right amount of raspberry, cranberry, pecans, or whatever the flavor of the day is.\n\nDaniel, the owner, is good people.  His staff provides excellent service, and you'll think you are family when you visit.  Smiles all around.
2;The view is a pretty good one. The service was with the smiling friendly. The prices were a little expensive for a limited selection. They only had two beers on tap and no other bottled beers. They had the usual liquors but no original Canadian or French beers. It's a little difficult to find because you have to go down into the basement and then find your way up some elevators to the rooftop because it is part of a hotel. The atmosphere is casual and it can be fun unless it is windy or it starts to rain
1;It's not my favorite place and they didn't do a flawless job- but I went in and got my regular gel manicure that I always get.  I was just lazy so I popped in here since it's closer to my house than my regular place.\n\nI was seated right away so A+ for that.... but the guy that did my nails was a smoker and must have just had a smoking break because he was stinky :(  On top of that... his hands were less than pretty.  I get that when you work on nails w/ acrylic and a million different shades of nail polish that you might not have a fantastic manicure but putting on some lotion and filing down your nails would make me more comfortable.  If you know how to take care of you own hands then I'll have more confidence that you can take care of mine.\n\nThe last critique that I have (and this just may be me) but they had the television turned onto one of those Deadliest Catch type shows and while I wanted to relax and pamper myself I was also stuck watching a bunch of fish getting their heads chopped off.  Less than relaxing.\n\nI'll probably skip over this place next time I come looking for a manicure.
1;I want to love this place.  The location is great, the view is nice, the staff seem nice, and the prices are reasonable.  However, the food needs serious work.  The dessert menu needs to be replaced entirely.  I tried the mud pie and it was a huge slab of very hard frozen ice cream - not good.  I also tried the caprese salad the other day.  The tomatoes could have used more basil but were ok.  On the other hand, the small balls of mozzarella were far too numerous.  I would rather have a few chunks of better cheese.  The whole salad was covered in cheap (gross) Parmesan cheese (as was the bread).  This stuff is not cheese.  It has no taste and it doesn't belong on a caprese salad in the first place.  I suppose some Parmigiano reggiano could have been ok, but if that is too expensive, skip it.  I will be back, because I have been waiting for a neighborhood place, but please work on the food.  Good food does not have to be super expensive, but it takes some care with ingredients and preparation.    I hope to update my rating with at least another star in the near future - if not, I am sad to say, it won't matter because this restaurant will be gone.
3;It's difficult to find a place on the strip, especially in the larger new hotels, that have reasonably priced food that actually tastes good.  we were dressed in shorts and tee shirts so opted for the casual dining menu in the front of the restaurant but when we go back we'll certainly give the upscale area a try.  However, that said, the food was really good.  I had the pasta special which was pasta folded over a spinach filling and covered with a wonderful light tomato sauce.  My husband had lasagna which he said was wonderful.  the portions were a reasonable size and even splitting a salad before dinner and dipping bread in olive oil and vinegar before we ate we still had room for dessert.  they have what they call tasting desserts which means they are inexpensive and small, perfect to end the meal.  The waiter told us they make all the pasta by hand every day and never use frozen or pasta made the day before.  Even with wine I thing the bill was right around $70 which for Las Vegas is a bargain.
4;I have went to an expensive East Valley salon for my eyebrows for over two years.  I was really hesitant about trying somebody new but my girls hours just don't accommodate me anymore.  I got my eyebrows done by Ivy and she did a great job.  I gave her a 50% tip since my eyebrows were only $10 and I was used to paying over 20!
3;I was trying to drive from Nogales to Yuma one night a while back when I pulled into Gila Bend at midnight and decided I was too damn tired to go any farther. The temperature gauge at the Yucca Motel noted it was 104 degrees. The hotel is decent for what you pay. It is the drop dead cheapest place in Gila Bend, and it is 1/2 the price of the Space Age Best Western. Everything was clean, but there is no air conditioning in the tiny, tiny bathroom. The room was incredibly small, and I felt like I was in a trailer or mobile home because of the interior decor. But then again for $60 or so, what would one expect.
3;Awesome Yellow Curry and a really good Pad Thai.
4;Bette Midler is an entertainer in every sense of the word. She sings, she dances, she acts, she tells bawdy jokes and all this at the tender age of 63. \n\nThis is an old school Vegas show and it radiates class. It's worth every dime to see a performer of this caliber in person. Bette sings for nearly 100 minutes during this show. \n\nSee this show while you can and spring for seats on the floor so that you can truly enjoy it. But skip the $130 souvenir t-shirt. \n\nThe showgirl must go on, indeed!
4;"Love the seaweed salad and octopus salad here- that's the reason why I come here!\nMy son loves their miso soup, salmon sushi, tuna sushi, California roll, esp. their Mango sorbet. If I ever ask him where he wants to go for lunch, he always says, \""Jasmine Tokyo\""!\nThis is our special place for lunch- if I didn't worry about our waistlines, this is where we would come weekly . . . If not daily. \nAside from a good selection of sushi, they also have a great selection of Chinese/ Asian cooked dishes, salads, desert. \nWe love this place- I hope they consider us regulars there!"
0;Tried it. And got out of the contract today. Overcharged for milk. Dishonest promises and on the contract the guy said to me today they can up the prices as they see fit. He told me it's on the CONTRACT. Thats means. We rip you off even thou we quote a certain price. Then we can raise it without warning and even not give you a 30 day notice in advance. I elected to let them cheap me for the meesly money and just be done with them. I sure wasn't willing to pay the closing the acct fee either since it was them and not me that didn't follow thru with their contract and deliver what was promised to me to begin with. They will beg you to stay. Then they will try and say the good deals only last for six month trial period. At that point you have signed a contract and you will pay double from over the six months to the next. BE prepared. From day one when the guy came to enroll me in the program. I asked them WHERE is the price list? How do I determine if it's a good idea to go with your company? Very misleading and confusing how this company operated. Of course you need to know prices before you know what your getting into but after speaking with the guy today. He says it's just the price after six months. YOU will receive different prices and of course they are going to be absorbant. You decide if I save you the headache to forewarn you in advance. I would say more but it's not a good honest company. I don't wish to get into everything I experienced. But the food is not all that either.
4;"After trying to get a certificate from www.restaurant.com for so long, I finally purchased one (it wasn't sold out). We tried this place because I had to pick up a prescription from the nearyby Pharmacy. (Note: we also like other restaurants in this tiny strip mall area.) And frankly, I wanted to see why the certifcates were in demand for this restaurant. I admit, I was curious. Also, we really wanted Thai food. \n\nFirst of all, the decor was really surprisingly nice. I love the ornate tapestries of Thai culture (elephants). The menu waspretty extensive. Also, there is a lunch special menu. \n\nSince we were using a certificate, we ordered an appetizer: spring rolls, two entrees: yellow curry chicken with potatoes and thai style fried rice, two thai iced teas, and dessert: taro ice cream. Everything was very good. The yellow curry dish was the standout dish for us (it reminded us of Lotus of Siam in the Commercial Center). The taro ice cream was the best that we ever tasted (We go to Hawaii and we've tasted many taro items on the islands). My husband wanted to buy a pint from them! SInce we ordered a lot of food, we had to box the rest up. (Yay! Leftovers! More for later.)\n\nWe were definitely surprised at how good the food was- being that we never tried it, and we've come to this strip mall for years to eat at the other restaurants that we like. Now I understand why those certificates keep selling out! It belongs on the \""Best of Las Vegas\"" list. The service was really good. The server was friendly and attentive. We would definitely come again and we might bring some friends with us. I immediately put the good word out there on Facebook. We're so glad that we found this really great Thai restaurant."
1;"\""I am sitting in fat sandwich watching the hapless fool cooking this garbage. He has to take a step back every 3 seconds to check the ticket for each ingredient. Good lord this place is slooooooooow.\""\n\nSo I wrote as a I waited at FSC.  Then I got my sandwich.  it was mediocre."
3;Very good unusual milkshakes great burgers the buffalo burger is great. Prices are a little higher then normal but still not bad. Check there web site for wait times it could be an hour just to get seated but there is alot of shopping around. Would definitely come back again
2;So, the BF and I ate here on Saturday in the afternoon as I had noticed it on a recent shopping trip to the Biltmore. \n\nThe decor and ambiance is first class and I found our service to be pretty good, but rich...oh my gosh!! I didn't need to eat anything the rest of the day (which is super unusual for me!) as I was so full from our lunch! It felt like everything was loaded with duck fat, truffle oil and butter, which normally I would not complain about, but this was too much! \n\nWe were starving when we arrived, so right away we ordered a yummy bottle of champagne (interesting wine list!), the duck confit salad and the truffle fries that we had spotted as we were seated at our table. The fries were delicious and the portion was huge! The salad was very tasty, but we were both surprised by the large duck leg and thigh on the plate with a yummy, ashy piece of Humboldt Fog cheese and small bunch of greens. It was good, but my goodness was it rich! \n\nThe BF was still hungry (how, I have no idea!) and had been eying the polenta and veggie sides, so we ordered those as well. Both were legitimately dripping in butter. Again, I am a girl who loves a rich meal, but this was a bit much! \n\nI will say that as we were leaving, Crush (the attached bar) was packed and both the BF and I commented that we would be up for trying the bar soon as it looked like a fun place to hang out and enjoy their happy hour. \n\nAll in all, be prepared for over the top, decadent options that individually are bombs, but all together is a little too much!
3;For the 'Monica Gellar' in all of us, this place has the storage and organizational tools for every part of your home!  \n\nLocated in Town Square, you can easily see the front from Las Vegas Blvd.  Parking is plentiful here and I would doubt you'd have any issues finding a spot.  You walk into a bright and airy store that is so organized that I felt my house was messy.   Any size container, any drawer organizer or closet organizational system can be found here.  They have some really great kitchen ideas that I didn't realize I needed until that moment I saw it.  Damn them for making me spend more money! LOL  \n\nThe customer service here was good!  The cashiers were friendly and quick.   They had someone help bag the items so it helped moved any lines along fast.  Now that I've experienced this store once, I know I'll be back.
4;Outstanding. What really impressed me about this hotel was the genuine commitment to excellent service. The rooms are nice, albeit a tad small, but well kept. The chamber maids did a thoughtful, excellent job daily in making up the room (I was there for 5 nights). The food is great, and the front desk and concierge were incredibly helpful in guiding me to taxi's directions etc..I hope to come back, and I will be using this hotel every-time.
3;We stumbled across this hole-in-a-wall last week and I've already been to it twice. Great food (loved the Turkey burger) and pretty reasonable prices. Liked ordering food on the IPads :). Nice touch.
2;Flavors were decent. They had about 7 different tubs of dishes to scoop from and a salad-type bar on the side. All the flavors weren't too different from one another - one more herby or one more spicy. The chicken dishes were well seasoned and relatively moist. They give you naan upon seating and you can ask for more. The naan is plain or... buttery? I typically love love love rice pudding, but this place makes it... interesting. It tasted ok, but it was thick. It had other goodies in it like almonds or something. \n\nStaff was attentive, but don't expect any smiles or warm fuzzy freindly feeling. Also, check your silverware... I changed out my fork 4 times because there was still dried food on it. The last fork I got still had dried food on it... but I was actually able to scrape it off with my napkin for this one. yeah...
3;Found this place on the west side of town 35ave & Glendale. So glad we did it has a great fish fry on Friday. $ 10.  All you can eat cod. What a deal it comes with frys, coleslaw or potato salad. The service is friendly & good.
1;I was not impressed by the pizza by any means. The red sauce had no flavor and there was very little seasoning on the pizza with the regular red sauce. The garlic sauce, on the other hand, was really delicious and I regret not getting it.
3;good location wish it was a little easier to get to but what can you do. Good selection and good service.
2;Awesome food! Hands down the best Italian deli in AZ \nJust a note - the owner solicits for tips but the employees never see any of the tips.  Have always tipped 40-50% of my tab & a little upset about it now because I believed the employees serving me were actually receiving the $ at the end of their shift. Not the case. \nI would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the owner soliciting for tips for his profit. Not cool :-|
3;I wish they offered something for the pescetarians (why do they no longer offer milk fish?) but my little meat eating family loves this place. My love can't stop eating the bugers and my teenager loves the chicken strips with mashed potatoes and gravy. I do love their french fries. I can't get enough of them. Only when their freshly made though. After sitting out for 20 mins, I'd much rather starve.
0;Don't waste your time and money at this car\nwash. The man that greeted me when I arrived was very unprofessional and was constantly trying to upsale me... All I wanted was an simple wash and he wanted me to pay $80 for some detail. Screw that!
3;After finding that one of my classes this semester called for a book a week, I decided that ASU didn't deserve all of my money and that I would try this place.  Best decision ever.  I walked in and talked to the first person that I saw behind the counter (I'm pretty sure his name was Kevin) and he was honestly the most genuinely considerate person I had ever met.  He knew exactly where to find every book and, even though he was clearly in the middle of something when I first walked in, he took a break to walk me around the store and help me find my list of nearly 20 books.  Although the store itself didn't have even a fifth of what I needed, the customer service was remarkable.  He even suggested other books that I ended up buying because he seemed to really know his stuff.\n\nI highly recommend this place and walked away all smiles.  (On a quick side note: I checked out 3 other bookstores similar to the concept of this one and everyone I asked to help me at the other stores was completely useless and almost rude.  So, save yourself the time from trying other places, like Bookmans, because I already did that for you). Changing Hands FTW!  :)
2;I can't believe I was craving pho in Vegas. The pho here was decent and not overly expensive for Vegas food ($9.75 a bowl). However, they do not offer very many choices - just chicken noodle soup or raw meat pho...those kinds of things.\n\nThe service was good though and situated in a very convenient location. I would come here again if I am craving Pho in Vegas though!\n\nNote: they serve thai iced tea for $4.50, but you only get 1 refill. That's pretty funny.
4;"Life in the Suburbs is lot different than the famous Strip (away from the Night Clubs, which are traps, established by Venture Capitalists, to part the money from the tourists mostly unsuspecting Japanese tourists, for promises of paradise, that was never delivered-only the paradise rd. ) When you are driving North on Durango and just before Sahara, you notice an ordinary looking Greek Cafe and the lure of the Gyro entices you to go in. When you are in you realize this is not a Cafe but a Greek Palace. The ornate and classy furnishings reminds you of  Caesar's Palace off the Strip. The Aegean Aesthetics is pleasing and soothing.\n\nThen you see if the food matches the decor. In my opinion of all the Greek places I have eaten...Yes. The gyro is a culinary invention  like the Chicken Tikka and Pizza. A vertical spit that is openly displayed at other cheap Greek places (like the rotating spectrum in barber shops) is hidden.  It is the best gyro I had, (other than \""Nicks Gyro\"" on Touhy and Harlem, in Park Ridge, Illinois.) The Gyro is well done, the pita bread crisp not soggy, right amount of onion and the zatiziki sauce...oh the sauce. How did mankind exist without this sauce? The taste is just out of this world specially gulped down with a Greek red wine not beer (beer tends to fill you up and takes where as a chilled red wine before and during the meal is better for the digestion.) The other item I tried was Chicken and Lamb Kebabs. The only other place I have had that kind of kebabs was at Marrakesh on Paradise Rd. They even have belly dancers on last Wednesday of the month with a Variety Dinner Show. Can't beat this place for the money and the ambiance.\n\nThe portions are huge and the food is as fresh you can get and is is fast. The bar which is one of the best stocked bars has video machines and assortment of world beers. The service can be spotty at times but if you are not in hurry-which is a shame-when you are dining in a classy place like this. They even have a gazebo."
0;Breakfast was served cold. There were only six customers in the restaurant. They had more employees then customers. Yet, they served our breakfast cold.
4;Great Italian fare from a family owned restaurant.  You don't have to pay extra for fine dining atmosphere or a personal waiter in this informal pizzeria   But the food is as good or better than I have had in expensive Italian sit down restaurants. \n\nTheir eggplant Parmesan is incredible.  The eggplant is sliced paper thin. Even if you don't like eggplant, this is a must try entree. \n\nThe only negative I can think of is there is sometimes a little bit of a communication problem with orders.  They get it right but it takes some discussion to clarify.  The problem is mostly because I don't speak Italian.  Did I mention this is a family run restaurant?  An Italian family run Italian restaurant.  Mamma must have been a really good cook.
2;We have never eaten in the actual restaurant but typically order take out from here. I like the option to choose from either Chinese or Thai items. I love their Panang. The portions are a good size. I find it strange that they only serve a very small container of steamed rice with the entrees. Seems a bit cheap to me since most other restaurants give you a big serving with an entree. The food tastes fresh so we come back.
0;"I've eaten at Isabella's twice - once for lunch and once for dinner.  Both have been horrible.  \n\nThe Service:\nOn our first visit, the service was fine.  On our second, however, the service was downright strange.  Our waitress threatened, jokingly(?), to punch one of us in the face if we dropped our napkin again.  She subsequently stated that she \""spit on the fish\"" when she served it to one of the members of our party, but quickly stated she was joking.  In addition to the above, she insisted on calling my wife \""girl\"" as if they were lifelong friends (they weren't).\n\nThe Food:\nIn a word - HORRIBLE.  On my first visit, we went for lunch and I ordered a tuna sandwich.  The waitress indicated that it was \""Italian style\"" brown tuna.  I've had tuna like that before and was looking forward to it.  Boy was I disappointed.  The tuna was under-seasonsed, overly salted, and down right disgusting.  It wasn't suitable for animal, let alone human consumption.\n\nI would not have returned based on the tuna alone, but was convinced by my wife to give it a second chance for dinner.  Big mistake.  For dinner I ordered the lasagna, but  it was horrendous.  The \""chef\"" had taken an under-seasoned tomato meat sauce and thrown it in between several over-cooked lasagna noodles.  The tasteless \""meat\"" in the meat sauce was over-cooked as well, included a piece of gristle (or worse) in each bite.  Desert was equally disappointing.\n\nIn summary - do not eat at this restaurant.  Ever.  You will regret it."
1;We first went this restaurant about 10 years ago and had not returned until today. It my be another 10 years before we go back. On the positive side the interior of the restaurant is very nice, the chips are ok, and the waitress we has was ok.  On the minus side the salsa was hot with no alternative, the tacos were bland, and the enchiladas were very spicy. Three shredded tacos were $9.50  with no rice or beans. La Casita, Los gringos , and  Filibertos are all better choices in The Apache Junction area
0;We are first class travelers .... This hotel has poor service!,low standards!!! Booked a non-smoking suite awhile ago....they checked us in to a stinky room....smelt  of smoke and then moved us to another non smoking room that stunk terrible from smoke! They said they were filled up! We left .... Rather give our $$$ to another hotel who appreciates our business! I would NEVER recommend this hotel  and NEVER go back!!!! Absolutely TERRIBLE CUSTOMER service!!!!!
2;This was my first experience with a Brazilian steakhouse and I had a great time. The fresh salad/vegetable bar was very well stocked with a great variety of fruits, vegetables, and Brazilian favorites. The meat selection as they came around was very good, but I couldn't help thinking that I saw sirloin's much more often than the more tender rib selections. Lamb was a once a night occurence, so I walked away full, but thinking I missed out.on some of the better cuts that night. In addition, when we had been there just 45 minutes there was a clear message that it was time to go. I'm not used to that an a fairly expensive restaurant, especially when we're enjoying drinks, but they needed to cycle our table. Would I go back? I think I'll have to try another Brazilian steakhouse and see if I walk away feeling the same.
0;"My girlfriend and I have ordered from here twice and she has gotten sick both times. I have been OK, but the quality of the food is definitely in the \""cheap\"" category so those with sensitive stomachs need not apply."
3;After discovering this bakery on our last trip, it was imperative that I make a stop on our first morning in town for an apple fritter.  It is priced the same, just as large and, most importantly, just as delicious.
4;"This buffet still and is one of the top buffets in Las Vegas from the top notch service, upscale design and food options. This shows how much a buffet of this caliber still is one of the Top 5 buffets in Vegas. \n\n-IMHO-\n\nMy top 5 buffets are:\n\nBellagio - The Buffet\nWynn - The Buffet\nMirage - Cravings\nPlanet Hollywood - Spice Market Buffet\nMandalay Bay - Bayside Buffet\n\nThe buffet line can get really long but mostly on weekends and the time of day but if your an Mlife Gold member, you have your own line and no wait! Just some perks of being an Mlife card holder. ;)\n\nThe buffet is expensive especially in a hotel like Bellagio but one thing I heard was to come an hour early to pay for the breakfast price or punch price before they start switching the plates and you save around $12 - $20 USD. Not bad Ehhh....\n\nThe selection is superb which only a buffet like Bellagio would have with a meat station that has Kobe beef, juicy and tender prime rib, suculent baby pigs, chicken and Roast beef.\n\nThe seafood section which is my favorite part if the buffet, second would be dessert, has the huge large size shrimp in ice with the cocktail sauce on the side and the king crab legs which are already cut in half so you don't have to break the legs and dig the meet out but they have clampers available. \n\nThe desert section is just a half circle in the buffet and includes different kinds of cookies, cakes, pastries and last but not least GELATO!! =P \n\nWhat also seperates this buffet with the other strip buffets is that it has a restroom located inside the buffet so you don't have to walk outside through the casino and be tempted to gamble. Most buffets were designed for to walk out when using the restroom and gamble but this to me was a +++.  Did I mention the customer aervicewas excellent, one incident proved how my waitress went above and beyond for their buffet guests. I was planning on going back to get a new plate and decided to leave my cell phone on the table and when I came back to my table it disappeared and I thought someone had stolen it. Then my waitress came back and told me she thought I had left the buffet and wanted to keep it in safe hands incase it went amiss and I was so impressed with what she had done especially watching out for the customer. I couldn't remember her name but I do remember what she looked like and I'll never forget how honest and caring she was unlike other waitresses in buffets who were just having a bad day. Psssh!\n\nI shall return to this buffet eveytime I visit Vegas.\n\n=()"
2;"Not too shabby. Don't let the exterior fool or scare you for that matter. A couple girlfriends of mine were looking for a divey bar to waste time before heading to our destination- and at first sight I won't lie, I was pretty much in the \""you have got to be out of your mind' mode when I saw the place but when we went in the place it was actually pretty cool. Very clean, 6 pool tables, darts, a long bar with plenty of high top tables around as well  with seating and even a claw machine...you know the ones that you get stuffed animals but this one also had 'adult' toys if you will. Quite comical. The barmaid was pretty nice and funny as well and the patrons well they were interesting people to say the least. The have a juke box that has a pretty good selection of music and last but not least CHEAP DRINKS. My whiskey sours were only $3 a piece"
1;"Nice looking hotel but having a night club just across the front desk does not look good.  Little Girl: Daddy, why is that lady naked. Dad: Honey, she is just drunk and wearing a ultra short skirt.\""  Nope, not family friendly at all. \nI don't know why the owner thought a nightclub inside the lobby area was a good idea. lol"
1;"I had couple of my friends in town they wanted to try Pamon I tried it when it first open.  At that time the food was good and service was not bad. But yesterday when I took my friends there we had to wait by the door for at least 5 minutes there was no \nwaiter no hostess nobody to great us or show us to our table. after 5 min I saw the \nwaitress that was serving another table screaming from that table \""you can seat anywher you want' that made me very upset in front of my guests.Then we sat .\nwe placed our orders I would not recomend the combination appetizer it is a big \nmess in a plate there is one  teaspoon of hummus, one teaspoon of every thing else \nthere is four of us and 3 dolmas.Nobody enjoyed that appetizer.Don't ask me how every thing tasted I don't know because every thing was mixed up together. The food came. Thank God the food was not too bad.We had the ground beef and the chicken\nkabob.I don't know if I would go back there or not. You have  judge this place your selves.I gave two stars because bad service is not acceptable."
3;"Another pleasant 4-star surprise!  Really had my doubts about this place.  The location hasn't fared too well over the years.  Was the Rib House a while back and then Stackers and it didn't seem big enough to be a full-fledged dining option.  \n\nBut the owners did a great job of remodeling.  The food is pretty good for what it is - burgers, sandwiches.  We ordered a reuben anda ham specialty sandwich.  The latter was delicious - honey ham, cheese and a fried egg.  As the Czechoslovakian Brothers Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd used to say, \""that's your funeral!\""  It was tasty.  Side order of tater tots was also very good.\n\nBeers were solid.  Decent selection of Charlotte craft brews and lots of cans.  We tried an I-77 IPA from Four Friends and an Old Chub can from Oskar Blues, which now has a brewery in Brevard, NC as well as Colorado.  Good stuff.\n\nService was smiley.  Too many TVs which nearly led me to give this place 3 stars.  I don't get the whole \""TV at every turn\"" thing.  It's ricockulous and an assault on the frickin' senses and makes me long for a good old fern bar, where that's right, the only decoration is a fern hanging on the wall.  But the generation X, Y and Z kids love their big 100-inch flat screen plasma LCD 3-D hi-def TVs, so rock on everybody!!!!"
4;Dr Kiernan and her staff are phenomenal. I've been seeing her (no pun intended, of course) for several years now and have had nothing but fantastic experiences.\n\nShe is very professional, super nice and very thorough. Makes going to the eye doctor a very pleasant experience and I appreciate it.
4;"They really have a great value on their food.one of the best AYCE sushi in Vegas. Atmosphere is casual but nice. The people are nice and friendly. staff are friendly and remember your regular orders. there may be a time limit on \""eat all you can eat\"" but the service is the fastest  i seen.the price is reasonable you can not go wrong.."
4;Jason Silberschlag pulls off a pretty amazing thing here in the metro-PHX area.  Three shops with their own quirky details, passion and identity.  Each tailors specifically to the demographic at hand, which I can totally get behind.  The fact that each shop has its own deal going on is awesome - I really dislike chains and the chain feel/look.  I hadn't seen Jason in a while at the other shops, the times I'd frequented, and was happy to see him behind the bar when I came here for the first time.\n\nJust the same way the other Cartel shops have a selection of brewing methods, this one does as well.  Pour-over, aeropress, Chemex and traditional espresso (La Marz GS/3).\n\nAs expected from him, our drinks were flawless.  He transfers this knowledge and passion to the baristas, which is obvious even when one leaves his establishment to go somewhere else - they stand out in the crowd of many coffee-pullers.  The beans, who can complain?  Jason made his name with the roasting.\n\nI got a prepared sandwich here, and my was it tasty.  Bread was fresh.  Sauce, ingredients and overall creation was good.  Big Ben: you stole my tastebuds' heart that morning.\n\nCasual lounge area (see: couches), outdoor covered seating (see: hallway - shaded and cool!) and plenty of seating inside.  As normal, his handiwork shines throughout the shop.  Somehow I've never reviewed a Cartel shop before, despite my years of patronage.  My latest experience changes that.
1;Went back to this place today for lunch, and it was packed. I don't get it. It took an hour and a half to get lunch. There were 3 people total. We ordered 1 street tacos that takes less than 2 minutes, and 2 lunch special RibEye Rollup French Dips. \n\nI had the $14.50 Rollup that was way overcooked and tiny for $14.50. \n\nWe sat by the kitchen. We had to watch our friend from out of town who took us there, watch his taco order get cold.  Thankfully since we knew they had sat there for 15 minutes at least, so they made new ones in about 2 mintues.  \n\nThe wait staff was slow, and did not listen. I ordered an Arnold Palmer with mostly tea, and I got a glass of mostly lemonade. \n \nSorry that was their 3rd strike for me. \n\nIn this area if you want a GOOD Beef sandwich go to Oregano's. They have a Salad version that's great as well.
0;"You know that little voice in your head that says not to go down that alley or drink that last drink? I was feeling that when booking for this show, but I thought, \""Hey, it's Michael's music, I can do that.\"" \n\nBoy, was I wrong.\n\nAny time that you are seeing an impersonator, you have to remind yourself that they will never be as good as the original. Good, maybe even mediocre, and most of the times just god awful. This falls into the category of sheer fuckery, almost comical, and a bit sad. \n\nIf you're playing Michael Jackson, you have to have the chops to not only sing, but dance as well. I felt that I was at a Happy Hour Karaoke, the dude's voice annoyed the heck out of me and he also forgot the lyrics most of the time! The mic went out at some times too. I found myself completely ignoring him and focusing my attention on the dancers and the musicians--that itself tells you it wasn't worth the price!!\n\nAs much as I was glad it was over, it was only an hour! Really?? I hated that the switching from song to song was so fast, it didn't give enough time to let the moment simmer, so to speak. It was like a game of how quickly I could get through the songs. SMH.\n\nThe audience seemed amused. Some people really go into it, so what do I know. The place is circular with seats, plus a bar that charges ridiculously for their drinks. Meh. \n\nDo yourself a favor, save your money and go see MJONE at Mandalay Bay."
3;Me and the boyfriend met some people here for Sunday brunch. Warning, this is a pretty small spot, so things can be a bit hectic. Fortunately, we had a reservation, and were seated right away. Service was pretty good. While one of us had to wait for their food a bit longer than necessary, our unlimited mimosas were never empty, and they even gave us one to go (score)! :) The ambiance was nice and modern, and our table overlooked the pool area. Now for my favorite part, the food. \n\nThe table received an order of the monkey bread. While I was not a fan, everyone else at the table thought it was great. \n\nDuck Confit Poutine - this was my first time trying duck confit and a poutine, and it did not disappoint! The duck confit was phenomenal, and I am a fan of all things potato. I think they may have taken some liberties with calling it a poutine, as it was more of a tomato sauce rather than a gravy, but delicious nonetheless. Topped with a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg, and this dish was a winner. \n\nBlue Claw Crabcake Benedict - unfortunately, I only got one bite of this dish before my boyfriend cleared his plate in no time flat. Needless to say, he loved it!\n\nThe other two in our party had the chicken and waffles and the grilled skirt steak sandwich. I did note get to try either, but they liked both dishes.
1;It has changed since before when it was more of a PT's type of setting. The food is good however kinda over priced which all bar food is but the bartenders are kinda rude ... Their pool is kinda lousy as well... All in all it's ok.
2;This can't be too common of a complaint, but if you're hanging out w/ foreigners, be aware they refuse to take passports as valid IDs (but also don't take foreign driver's licenses...so I guess they only serve Americans?)\n\nOther than that, nice, cool chill place.
2;I stayed here as a solo traveler for business one night this past week.  This was the third trip to Vegas and second time on the strip, my first stay was at Circus Circus, which I considered decent (outstanding for the vacation price Southwest gave me) but this time I wanted to try something nicer.  Everything was very nice, I checked in around 7 pm so the line was short, very friendly staff and I'm including everyone that I dealt with not just the front desk employees.  For me, finding my room on the 9th floor of the West Wing was difficult and I'm not above using my map or asking for help.  I must have looked like I knew where I was going because four or five other people asked me for directions, so I would guess this isn't an uncommon complaint.  I really liked the fact that you could get to the gym easily, the elevator marked it on the 4th floor but I wasn't able to check it out due to forgetting my teeshirt and I didn't want to spend 30 bucks on a shirt at the gift shop just to sweat in it.  I tried out the buffet, always an awkward experience when eating alone but I couldn't decide on which restaurant in the hotel I wanted to eat at and I regretted the decision. The food was decent and at (what I assume is) the correct warm/cold temp, good price so I'm not complaining but last time I had lunch at the Luxor and I feel like it was much better food and selection.    My main complaint is the hotel fee of 24.95, I understand it's for internet and other services and that ALL the other hotels charge a price as well (this is the most expensive one so far) but then I feel that the internet service should be up to par.  In my room, I got two bars it was slow enough that I ended up just using my hotspot from my phone, that's right my 3G connection to my tablet was faster than the 24.95 I paid for, basically, internet at the hotel.  The next morning I figured I would just go to the Starbucks to use the WiFi there and yet again, no service.  This time I was able to pick up on another hotels connection and it was stronger than the hotel's that I was actually staying/sitting at. Problem, oh heck yes. \n\nPros:\nClean hotel\nFriendly staff\nEasy check in\nWon 40 bucks in penny slots (lost same 40 bucks at gift shop)\nOn the Strip\nBy Monorail (I didn't use it though)\nLarge food/activity selection\n\nCons:\nThe creepy long mirrored hallways, really am I the only one creeped out by those?\nhorrid internet service\nHard to find anything at the hotel, I'm pretty sure I missed about 75% of the whole place.\n\n\n\nThe main question, would I stay here again? Answer In the future yes, if the price was right I would, I don't have that many complaints about it but I am planning my next trip to Vegas and I am certainly finding a different hotel for this next stay.
0;I was super excited that there was a convenient place that I could upload photos on the internet and pick up the prints later. They were a bit pricey, but it was worth it for the convenience. \n\nUnfortunately whatever system they have for printing photos, involves leaving the prints out in the open. My co-worker recognized some of my photos sitting in their machine and picked them up. When I went to pick up my photos, there were some missing. Do not print your photos here.
1;"Have taken my dog here once before to Holly (my neighbor referred me to her). Holly did an excellent job and I rescheduled with her. Had to change my appt and was put with someone else that was available on the day I needed. I called to double-check the appointment time only to find out my appointment was never moved to the new day and that now I couldn't get in. HUGE inconvenience because my doggie is getting surgery and that's why I moved the date up. I realize errors will be made but come on! And when I reminded the scheduler about our original conversation and guessed that he just \""forgot\"" to make the switch, he put me on hold and someone else got back on with a lame excuse. Poor customer service...I won't go back, even as good as Holly is."
4;"My fiance had a conference in Vegas earlier this week, so we came out a couple days early to relax. I happened to see a Travelzoo deal for the spa at GVR so we decided to both get massages. I had never been to GVR but based on reviews here we decided to roll the dice, and I'm glad we did!\n\nI used the men's spa area as well as the gym, and we spent a couple hours before our service lounging by the very tranquil and relaxing spa pool. We also ordered a couple of food items and basically had a FANTASTIC day at GVR. \n\nThe gym was well-appointed, including a decent variety of dumbbells, a smith machine, medicine balls, a pulley station, a variety of machines & a bunch of cardio equipment. \n\nThe men's spa included a jacuzzi, steam room, sauna, showers, sink/shaving area, locker room, and lounge area with a couple of flat screen TVs, snacks, etc. Service in the men's spa was very good. \n\nThe pool is surrounded by lounge chairs & daybeds, most of which are open seating. There isn't a TON of seating, so it might be wise to go earlier in the day if you plan to lounge by the pool. Although, there was decent turnover in the lounge chairs. There is also an outdoor jacuzzi. \n\nWe requested our individual massages in the couple's room, which was great, and we both really enjoyed our 80 minute session. I was told you can rent out the couple's room as well (includes a large bathtub, shower, and looked like some private outdoor lounge chairs?). My fiance loved her massage and I thought my technician did a fantastic job as well.\n\nThe spa at GVR was great for us as a couple because it allowed us to spend time together by the pool and not separate in the mens & womens spa areas. If you like to enjoy these experiences with your significant other then this is a nice touch. \n\nOverall, I found no major faults with the spa at GVR. The only thing that might concern me is in general the spa is small in comparison to some of the larger outlets in the Strip area, but that was not an issue the day we were there. We both walked away with a new appreciation for this more \""locals\"" property & will certainly be back!"
3;"I love going to this store, probably one of the only stores in the entire world that I can spend more than 10 minutes in without walking out empty handed. Yes this place is spendy but if you are a somewhat thrifty shopper such as myself you can actually score some really good deals. \n\nThis store also has an extremely good return policy, essentially they will take anything back for whatever reason within a year and sometimes more. I purchased a few items and they went on sale two weeks later and they were happy to credit me back the difference. I guess that procedure is pretty typical at retail stores but they didn't make me feel like I was stealing something when they were crediting my account back.\n\nAlso a lot of people don't know that once a month they have a \""rummage sale\"" You have to get there early because if you are not within the first 30-40 people most of the really good items are gone. They basically resell all of the returned items at ridiculous discounted rates. All the items are slightly used. The have a ton of footwear at deeply discounted prices. Example my last score was a $150 pair of Merrel hiking boots worn once maximum for $9.83. The sole wasn't even scuffed. Just look on their website when the monthly garage sale is. \n\nThe only thing that I am a little put off by this store is that to really fit in when shopping I feel like I need to have a beard."
0;"I love Flos and I can eat here few times a week. well I was picking up somebody at the airport and it was around lunch time, so i figure I will have my dose of Flo's. Wow what a disappointment. The food was AWFUL, i could not even eat and I will never go there again, I got Rice with the Mongolian beef with Broccoli, \""Ye-ks\"". Flo, PLEASE close this place down because this is not a good representation of your hard work. \n\nDont waste your money on this location. I will go to Flos on FLW and Thompson Peak any day. I love it."
1;I read all the great reviews from this place so I was excited to try it. I ordered it online and it said it'll be ready in 30 minutes. When we got there 20 minutes later they said that they had technical difficulties with their printer apparently and it didn't print out so we had to wait another half an hour for the food. Finally an hour later we got home to eat it and honestly I wasn't impressed. The yakisomi noodles were very dry, there were very little vegetables and the beef was not good. The drunken noodles were also dry and not very hot although we did order medium so that could've been our part but they were still dry. The dumplings were over fried and very dry as well. The crab rangoons were okay. I'm not sure I will be returning but I guess I should've guessed with the low prices.
0;"Very very disappointed at the girls here... I would have expected them to be of finer quality here then at other hooters establishments, but they were worse!!  Of the 20 or so girls there, they did not live up to the \""name\"" you \""look\"" for. I think all the attractive girls went to make more money elsewhere in Vegas.\n\nOnto the food...  the wings are pretty good as always, but the fries they gave us were sooooooooooo cold!!  And the girls I was with would not let me send them back for fresh ones (they didn't want them to defile the new fries)."
2;This place is really cool for the atmosphere because it's fun, friendly and the IN-place to be.\n\nWe were told the wait was about 45 minutes to an hour, but were seated after about 30 minutes.  It's really a lot like Johnny Rockets.  I really didn't know what to order so I asked the waitress who recommended the frozen hot chocolate. It was good, not spectacular, but good.  It kinda sucked that it cost about $10 though, especially since I didn't finish it.  I also ordered the tomato soup and sweet potato fries, which I completely finished. My husband ordered a burger with regular fries and he finished his meal too.\n\nIt wasn't the best place we've been to, but it was good.
2;This buffet must have passed its prime as the food certainly did not live up to my memory.  The prime rib was probably the best thing I tried, nice and tender, but the thin slice I got didn't accentuate the cut of meat. The snow crab and shrimp (small) cocktail I usually splurge on weren't the best. Crab claws seemed over steamed as they were stuck in their shells. \n\nThey do have all the typical French fare like sole (overcooked), mussels (ok), duck (good), roasted chicken (better). Crawfish was rather fishy and didn't taste too fresh.\n\nThe selection of fruit was limited to cantaloupes, melon, and pineapple.\n\nBut where this place shines must be the pastries, which I'm not too big on so I can't comment on that. Come for dessert I guess.
4;"I'm as much a carnivore as anyone, but this place was surprisingly good.  We had mongolian \""beef\"" and general tzo's \""chicken\"" and both of them were quite good.  We also tried their soy ice cream with quinoa and it was really amazing.  The chef came out to talk to us about our meal and his cooking too.  It was a really great dinner."
4;CHA, CHA, CHA, CHA CHAIYA!\n\nAfter seeing EVERYBODY check in here every last Sunday of the month, I finally got the chance to join them this last one on 3/30/14. Better late than never I guess. \n\nAs I show up with my wifey, I just happen to bump into Andrew C who was nice enough to give me some pointers. He kind of ended up being my Chaiya guide along with tips by other Yelpers. First thing you notice about this place is that its right in the middle of a neighborhood community. \n\nFirst stop was to put my name down on the clipboard for an order of Pad Thai ($5). Wifey got 10 Pork Satay Skewers ($1 each). Then on down to the Sticky Mango Rice table ($5). After that the Thai Soup table ($5). Next is Papaya Salad ($4). \n\nSince just about everything was made fresh, you had to do a bit of waiting for certain things. Like the Pad Thai. They cook it from scratch with two big woks so two orders can be cooked at a time. Same goes for the Papaya Salad. The guy is literally peeling the skin off the fruit and finely slicing it for the salad mix. As for the Sticky Mango, they can only peel and cut the fruit so fast so the wait for that is based on how many mangos they can carve. Once they run out of that and sticky rice, you are out of luck. The Pork Satay Skewers are all ready to go and cooks pretty quick on the grill. The Thai Soup table has all the ingredients ready to go as well. You just need to select thick or thin noodles, then they throw it in a medium sized styrofoam bowl  along with broth, meat, and pork balls.\n\nShout outs go out to Nik O, Debra W, Terri R, and Chris V for helping me out also. Nik gave me her extra Eggroll to try out. Debra told me what there was to drink. Terri told me about the vegetables available for purchase. Lastly, Chris told me about the Curry Puffs that you have to order a month in advance. He even gave me one from his stash to try. Thanks a lot guys!\n\nSome random info: Cash only! Preferrably small bills. Sometimes they give you coins that are worth 2 dollars that is valid for their items only. Come early! Show up just right before 9 am for great parking, better selection, and getting your Pad Thai quicker by being one of the first to sign up. Phone reception is low so it might take you a while to check in and upload pics sometimes. Lastly, this is an outdoor event so always be prepared for what the season may bring. If you follow what I just pointed out from beginning to end, you will fare much better than most peeps that show up later on.\n\nOverall, I am kicking myself for not coming here sooner. Next time I am bringing back up. Usually on Saturdays and Sundays, I tend to sleep in but in cases like access to delicious cheap food and good company, I don't mind sacrificing a little bit of sleep. Hay, maybe I can nap........errr I mean meditate for a bit inside the monastery.\n\nYelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #92
1;Pulled Pork sliders were so bland I had to add tobasco sauce for flavor. The philly steak was also meh. Too bad we had such limited selections since we had to get a quick bite to eat before the show.
3;J'y suis all\u00e9e pour les gaufres li\u00e9geoises du dimanche qui m'avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 chaudement recommand\u00e9es et je n'ai pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9\u00e7ue.
1;So I came here last weekend for Punk Rock Bowling 2012. The show was hella fun, but the service here stunk. I played by the rules and just tried to have a good time. I tried not to cause too much trouble, but trouble found me. \n\nFirst of all, the security here are assholes. I stumbled in the front with my friend and tried to get a free shot because they were giving out free shots during the weekend. Security came up to us and said we couldn't have them. We told him we had a bottle in the room and he followed us all the way to the elevator. I flipped him the bird and came back down 10 minutes later with a bottle of Jack and he still followed us out of the casino. \n\nWe got a smoking room. One of the people who stayed in the room didn't want us smoking in there so we smoked near the ice machine. Security kicked us out of there too. First of all, if you come to Vegas(especially Fremont) then you shouldn't have to deal with this.\n\nOther than all that bullshit I had a great time. The restaurants and food in the casino area were pretty cheap and Fremont was right there. Hobo central is right down the street too so be careful who you talk to. 2/5
4;Today was my first time visiting the world renowned Daily Dose. I was pleasantly greeted upon my arrival by the hostess! There was a small wait time. We got seated with the most wonderful young gentleman I have every had the pleasure of meeting. His name was Max. Max was so amazing, when I first sat down he asked me if I wanted something to drink. Why yes! I would love something to drink! The thought thrilled me. He was thrilled too. \nNext thing you know, max brought me my drink! I really recommend the pomegranate green tea. Max likes the tea too!
3;For me, it's a layover stop. Southwest stops on the way to SF or LA... What I appreciate about airports is the coffee, healthy options and ease of use. I can't talk. About TSA, but they have great healthy options (nice salads just order dressing and cheese on the side) at the Paradise Bakery & Cafe. You can also get good Mexican @ the place next to it. (C terminal). \nGood seats - the plush lounger type with the plugs at every seat. Not all have them but there are some. But I like to be a rockstar and carry my own power strip when I travel (which is too often) and make friends and fans wherever I go.
1;Don't hate on me, Yelpers, but I really wasn't satisfied with my visit to Bouchon when I went a couple of weeks ago. First of all, the wait was only supposed to take 20 minutes according to the hostess, but we waited outside for a good hour. This isn't some Asian restaurant where the host/hostess always says the wait will only take 20 minutes so that people will be fooled and stay longer because they already stayed for a long time. The good thing is that they provided us with some really good pastries while we were waiting. But then more bad things happen...\n\nThey take 30 minutes to get our order.  And it takes about another 40 minutes to get our food. My friend didn't even get the diet coke he ordered at the beginning until after we already started eating. Was this special handmade diet coke? NO. It was from a freakin bottle. I know because he got the bottle with his glass. \n\nI ordered the croque madame expecting goodness considering we waited so long to eat there and it was ranked so highly on Yelp. I gotta say, I wasn't too fond of it. The taste was just meh. And the price I paid for that was disgusting ($19 before tax and tip). I also got to try the mussels, which were alright, but the taste was a bit overwhelming. I think I would have been sick of them after 5 mussels. I got to try the waffles from the chicken and waffles dish as well.  The waffles were disgusting. There are bacon bits inside the mushy waffles. Gross.\n\nWould I come back? With all the quality food available at Vegas with a much shorter wait, probably not.
1;Boneless wings are delicious however does not make up for the crappy service. Waitress was unfriendly and too busy. Threw a printed piece of paper my way when I asked what was on tap and seemed preoccupied with her kids talking to her. Rarely checked back probably because my boyfriend and I are younger and she assumed wed be bad tippers because all the tables around us got plenty of attention. Here's the kicker michelob ultra is considered a premium here. I'm a bartender in the majority of the bars that I frequent and work for this is not the case. When I asked for a manager her attitude was snotty about it. I won't be back.
4;Row House is a welcome addition to Butler St. and I recommend it to any cinephile. I'd been waiting for a chance to get to the Row House, and the perfect opportunity presented itself during its Katherine Hepburn retrospective last week. \n\nEach week, the Row House picks a different theme (actor, director, genre, etc), giving a sense of continuity in programming. When I arrived for a showing, I was pleasantly surprised to find you can purchase a weekly pass and save. It's a great feature for a super fan.\n\nThe theater is cozy and had beer on tap (!!). My only issue is the seats aren't megaplex -comfy. \n\nThis review would've been a 4-star (sorry I love my seats!) if not for the customer service I received while at the theater. During our screening, nothing came on after the previews. We sat, maybe 3 minutes staring at a blank screen until the owner came in, apologized, and started the film up again. The technological malfunction was completely forgettable, but when we left the theater at the end of the movie, the owner was handing out vouchers for a free film. I thought it was completely unnecessary, but shows a great commitment to keeping us happy! \n\nI'll be back again, hopefully soon!
1;Went last weekend with 10 friends that came from overseas and they were not allow to drink alcohol because they only have a passport and not American ID!
4;Loved this! How many offices would you actually take a tour of?\n\nSay what you want about the Downtown Project, Zappos itself is a company I would love to work for. If you have ever (or are currently) working in a shite office for a company that makes you feel like you're just a statistic, than you should check out the culture here at Zappos. From the tour alone, I learned about the transparent corporate ladder, saw open workstations, casual dress, Batista's, free food, supplemented food, 'quiet floors', outdoor areas and a life coach. A LIFE COACH. If that's not caring, I'm not sure what is. \n\nSeriously, check this place out. It's really great to see a company investing in its own employees once in a while.
0;Just experienced the same horrible customer service from a Debra, which could very well be the owner, since the owners name is Debra. Had been assigned her thru my warranty company. I immediately called the warranty company and told them they shouldn't be using such rude people. They are cancelling the job with them and reassigning the work to someone else.  If they start out being rude taking your order i cant imagine what they would be like if you let them in your house. This house is in Az tho i am not.
0;I give it one star for the fact this is old vegas, but it reminded me of Venice Beach CA, all the street vendors and street freaks come out. I don't think I need to go back.\n\nTC
0;UTTERLY DISGUSTING!! The night started out great. We were seated fast with a reservation.  The waitress was knowledgeable and fast.  Our apps arrived hot and everything was going great until a huge roach decided to take a shortcut across our table.  I immediately called the hostess, who in turn ran and got the manager.  The manager came back red faced and apologetic. She acknowledged the pest problem and said it was due to construction out back.  That was of little consolation to me.  I couldn't help but think where else those little critters might be.   I would never go back there again.  EVER!!!!!
2;"Aside from the center-strip Travelodge, this is likely to be the best deal for the best location on the Strip. Even when the major hotels are $200+ a night, you can usually snag a room here for $100ish. Book straight through their website; sometimes there are 20% off deals.\n\nThe rooms are okay. Nothing special but a good enough place to hang your hat between long nights of partying and alcohol. If you're not a smoker yourself, definitely pick a nonsmoking room. There is a dramatic difference, smell-wise.\n\nThe tables here used to be depressing, but now they have a kitschy act called Dealertainers -- celebrity lookalikes who deal blackjack and perform every hour or so. Michael Jackson is pretty amazing. Good music selection too... during our time at the tables, we rocked out to Weezer and then jammed to Armin.\n\nBy the way, I always have to stifle a chuckle when I see how many Asian visitors they have here, even with the exaggerated \""Asian\"" theme. To me, it's like walking into Panda Express (guilty)."
0;my order was wrong and took forever and tasted like crap plus the employees were grab assing around and I seen them making out  a kid touch a girl on her ass in front of customers that is very un professional and they want a raise! grow up and act professional
1;I given this place three chances and they've struck out all three times.The food is mediocre as well as the service. The one thing I expect when I go to a restaurant is for my glass to stay full, especially when I'm the only customer dining in. I also had a voucher for the place that they made a big stink over. It's too much of a hassle for the quality of food. If you want better service and better food, go to Thai Basil instead.
2;10-15mins for the server to acknowledge us, once he got to us we figure we should order right away since we don't know how long it would take for us get our food and drinks, 3mins for drinks and 10mins for food to come.\nThe food was good and server nice but overall I gave it 3 stars because it took so long for the server to even acknowledge us.
2;Great intentions, but bad follow through.  The savory crepes sound amazing, but the actual crepes were lackluster with unbalanced ingredients.  The sweeter crepes are hard to mess up and are good.  Staff was very friendly, but the seating was crowded.  House-made chai was top notch causing me to immediately gulp it and want another.
3;Caps has been one of my favorite stops on the way home. On a recommendation I brought home a dozen grilled wings. Sauce or no sause, they were excellent! Check them out and let me know if you know of any better.
3;Cool little spot to hang out at. Went with some buds on a Monday night at 9pm. Kinda dead though with no live music and mostly empty seats outside. Seats were cush, with a great view of the strip and nearby volcano. Drinks were a little high, but typically priced for the strip. The Tangerine Trampoline was so-so. Tried the Blue Mist hookah - great flavor with a subtle buzz, but pricey ($40) - i won't splurge on the hookah again, i'll stick with a nice stoagie. \n\nWe may give this place another chance, but it will have to be on a Fri or Sat night late night when they have a live DJ and a little bit more lively crowd...
4;Hmm...I  have positive and negative reviews about my experience here. The night before I stumbled upon this fav store of mine, I was about 2k richer from winning the slots. Then I entered to window shop but they had stuff that the Miami store didn't have. So guess what happened?  I spent the winnings on 2 pairs of shoes and card case.  Yes it did feel good and I absolutely love this store :)  Nuff said.
4;"I felt like I HAD to go here when everyone was mentioning the \""secret\"" pizza place.  Following my fellow Yelp-ers directions, we stumbled upon this place and the smells were amazing!\n\nI kept it simple and we got a slice of the white pizza and the regular pepperoni pizza (we had just eaten at Pink's so we were a bit full).  Brought the slices back to the hotel (mistake, btw.  I should've eaten it right away.  They're best when hot from the oven!) and devoured it.  \n\nThe food was soooooooo awesome and easy on the wallet.  I definitely wanna go back!"
0;"\""Best Mexican Food in Arizona, California, New Mexico\""? Oh God I hope not. If so, I am so sorry.\n\nI went there the other day with some co-workers and ordered the #17--2 Carne Asada Tacos for $7.77. While I waited for my plate to come out, I helped myself to the self-service chips & salsa bar. The food came out relatively quickly and the portions were quite generous.\n\nI was presented with the typical Mexican plate--tacos, rice, and refried beans. While the carne asada tacos were relatively average, the accompanying rice and beans were absolutely terrible. Honestly...how can you mess up rice and beans? They tasted like they were mixed with cleaning solution.\n\nIn retrospect, any place that prides itself as \""Best...\"" is a self-delusional ploy at convincing yourself that your canned/frozen goods are better than other places' fresh goods. Methinks not."
3;Husband and I have decided to start trying different food spots from the norm. We were in the area and decided on Baby's (or bah-bee's, as Husband likes to pronounce it). I had seen an ad in some mailer and knew that they offered sugar-free lemonade (for the diabetic husband). He was excited for that, as he loves lemonade and can never have it outside the home. Anyway, we were there around 7pm on a Friday night and the place was pretty bare so I was a little skeptical. A few kids hanging in the parking lot and one person waiting for their to-go order. The cashier was very friendly. As we were looking at the menu he asked if we had ever been there and then proceeded with samples of both regular and strawberry lemonade. He suggested the crispy Phillies, and had I read prior reviews, would probably had ordered that. \n\nWe went with the original Phillies. Husband had Buffalo fries and sugar-free strawberry lemonade, I had garlic fries and strawberry lemonade. The lemonades were decent. The regulars are stored already made in the fridge counter shelf. The sugar-free was made to order with Splenda. They blend the drinks, so that's a yummy plus for me.\n\nThe sandwiches were good. Not amazing, but not bad either. I'd maybe prefer my onions and green peppers to be not as soft as they were, but I'm really not too picky. They told us that Baby's Secret Sauce is good on the Phillies, which it was. A sweet bbq-ish sauce with a little kick. Husband really liked his fries...regular fries doused with buffalo sauce...I think Franks since there was a bottle on the table. They came with a side of ranch. The garlic fries were also good and came with sour cream...reminds me of a yummy baked potato. The staff came by our table a couple times to ask if all was well and to clear the trash.\n\nOur meals were the special - Philly, fries & drink for $8.49. Normal prices would make it a little on the pricey side, but it was good food.\n\nThe menu is diverse and I think they'd have something for everyone. They even have a peanut butter and apple jelly sandwich. I have no idea if that may be a Chicago staple, but I have never seen a peanut butter/apple jelly sandwich on a restaurant's menu...only make them at home.\n\nBy the time we left, there had been a couple to-goers and a few eating in, with a couple ordering, so I decided that maybe business wasn't so slow after all. We will definitely be back so I can try the Crispy Philly!
3;Pretty good  breakfast food - liked the meat lovers scramble. Not too greasy for what it was.
4;"I first heard about Yum Yum BBQ from a friend. She said it was cheap, and good so i thought , what could go wrong there? \n\nThe first time I went there I ordered the crispy tempura roll, and the BBQ chicken plate. These dishes were good and made me want to come back for more. The second time I went to Yum Yum in 2009, I finally noticed that they had an \""all you can eat\"" menu. The price for the ability to eat all the sushi rolls, and Hawaiian foods that you wanted was an automatic steal. In 2009 the price for the \""all you can eat\"" menu was a dollar or two cheaper, like it really makes a huge difference. Along with the \""all you can eat\"" there is the \""all you can drink\"" option which allows you to get unlimited sodas or bottled waters from their fridge. One soda or bottle of water usually costs around 1.50-2.00  dollars so you might as well add on the \""all you can drink\"" option for another 2-3 dollars extra.\n\nThe first time I ordered the \""all you can eat\"" I brought along 5 of my friends to try it with me. They were here visiting from San Francisco, and of course just wanted to eat, eat, and eat. I thought it was a good way to take a break from all the ordinary Las Vegas buffets. We were amazed at all the food options listed on the \""all you can eat\"" menu. There was Hawaiian food such as, chicken katsu, BBQ chicken, spam masubi, etc. There was Japanese food such as the MANY types of sushi rolls they offer (One of my favorite parts about this menu, since regular sushi rolls in other restaurants sell for 8-12 dollars). And there was also delicious Korean BBQ. I definitely suggest the short ribs (kalbi).\n\nEvery year when my friends come to visit me, Yum Yum BBQ is always on the list of places to eat at here in Las Vegas. I'm sure the waiter who is always there knows us by now. He is really nice, and has lots of patience when serving a group of people who are all hungry for their yummy dishes. Oh and I forgot to add that you can only order 2 dishes at a time, but since it is a small, usually non-busy place, you'll be able to get your order pretty fast."
2;Without any sugar coating. I would say this place has issues with consistency. Its a shame, because when this place is good, it flies. But when its not beware, its pretty bad. Due to my diet, I'm usually stuck with two dishes here: The salmon, or the Cajun egg scramble. [Subbing out the grits or potatoes] Typically when they screw up, its with the salmon. It seems that they can cook it perfectly, or they can dry it out like none other. Additionally, it seems there is a bad system about getting biscuits out at the right time. When I first started coming here, the biscuits came out before the meal, but that only happens half the time now. [The other half is that they come out with the meal]\n\nTip: If you get the Cajun egg scramble, ask for it to be without the sour cream. The sour cream dampens the spice.\n\nReader's note: I've eaten here more than 15 times. Its not the worst place in the world, but they sure could fix the consistency issues.
1;"-our waitress was nice, but the other people barely even glanced at us. \n-nice, but we rarely saw her. it took like 20 minutes to get the check/back/change\n-ridiculously slow service/food arrival. two pizzas was about a two hour ordeal.\n\n-food: okay. prosciutto pizza was whatever. carne was slightly better but nothing good.\n\n-extremely...\""interesting\"" decorations. don't bring your kids here. but of course, it's kind of a bar anyway...\n-that said, the decor is decent. music is probably itunes'd - you can see a macbook on the second floor\n\nHOW did the night take so freaking long!"
3;This is a great little fro-yo place. Very clean inside with tasty yogurt and enough toppings (must be close to 50) to make your dessert weigh a full pound if you're not careful. Just wish they would change their flavors a little more often.
0;"THE WORST STAY EVER!\n\nWe booked the luv tub suite 2 months in advance here. we go to vegas once every 2-3 months, so we are rather frequent travelers to las vegas. Hearing of  \""renovations\"" supposedly being done to this hotel, being a kind of last minute trip we decided to give it a try.\n  First, apparently ALL suites at this hotel are located in the back of the hotel. This might make a little sense if it were to drown out the sound from the strip, but considering that the linq runs right next to it and the AMAZING sound of construction going on right below us, none of it made sense to us. We had a balcony, which we found out was locked when we got up to the room, though we weren't to distraught over it being that it looked like it had never been cleaned once (cigarette burns, stains, etc). Later on they told us that all balconies were locked. Which was interesting because when outside on the strip, you could see people out on their balconies. Maybe it was just our room. Cool.\n  \n  Second, the \""luv tub\"" was big ill give it that. Very outdated with no jets and takes about 20 mins to fill up, but we'll live. What wasnt to cool was the fact that it was DIRTY. Maybe they ran some water in it and called it a day, but the fact that i had to clean it if i was to go in wasnt in the description of this quality stay. Already a little annoyed i did what anyone would and called downstairs to possibly change my room. WE GOT AHOLD OF THE FRONT DESK ONCE OUR ENTIRE STAY!!! They would seriously not answer ever. Even if we called another department and had them transfer us, nothing. Our last day there we tried calling down there at about 930, let it ring for about 5 mins then set it down, took a shower, and when i returned, yep you guessed it, still ringing. Side note, using their blow-dryers might be a gamble in itself considering the broken one they had for us to use (picture). \n \n  The morning of the second day, which i tried calling again with no results, i went downstairs to talk to someone. The lady at the desk was very nice and understanding, though she said there was literally NOTHING she could do. So i ask for the manager. The manager, Cody, who was in the middle of sorting out some pamphlets of some sort, proceeded to step over a little to us, continue doing what he was doing while periodically looking up at me as he tells me there was not much he could do. He told the girl, not even telling us himself, told the girl to offer us our $15 dollar resort fee for 2 of the 3 nights back as a credit to either the flamingo buffet, the harrahs buffet or bettys diner. The buffet is $20 a person, so we would still have to pay about $15 extra after tax to even eat at one of the buffets. That defeated the purpose of this complaint. We could also instead upgrade to the next room up, the penthouse for a mere $65 extra a night. That was all he could do. I even asked to DOWNGRADE my room then instead to maybe a smaller one and get the difference refunded or as credit and that was not an option either (which is odd considering the credit it used at their resort only). \n\nBy this point im at lost at the service i had just received and had no choice to take his pathetic gift of an offer. \n\nAll in all, this was by far THE WORST experience i've had at a Vegas hotel. The WORST rooms and THE WORST service, assuming you can get any. I paid money for what? Maybe if they would have done something for all the inconveniences it would have counted for something, but nothing. They simply just didn't care. When i told him hed be losing a regular customer to vegas he literally just said \""well im sorry\"".\n\nWith 3 more Vegas trips already planned within the next 4 months, you can bet that The Quad is now off our list of places to stay. Not to mention our friends and family that will cross it off theres to. Best advice, stay somewhere where they actually care about their customers. \n\nIf you do plan on staying there anyways and not take the advice of the reviews on here, TRY THIS before to prepare. Stay at your nearest rundown motel, burn your money and then call it a vacation. Its very very similar and still might be better.\n\nSincerely,\nperson whos never written a review for anything until experiencing this piece of heaven on earth.\nCheers Quad. Impressive."
1;Our Sever was sooo painfully slow, it was too much to take on a not so busy Wednesday morning.. His name is Tracy, steer clear of his area if you want to eat while your food is hot and you would like coffee to be refilled on a timely basis.\nOverall bad
4;Super helpful and friendly staff. Every corner we turned a staff member was eager to assist. You Can rent equipment from this store. Randomly walked into a super awesome clearance where members who spent $100 got a $20 giftcard to spend later in the store...membership has already paid for itself!
2;The hotel faces onto a very busy frontage road. for a quiet night's rest, ask for a room on the back side.
3;Au c\u0153ur d'un vieux deli une cantine bar hipster sur le Plateau. Un cadre qui a su conserver le c\u00f4t\u00e9 kitch vieillot avec quelques touches de modernit\u00e9.\n\nLe genre \u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 renouveler avec une carte certe courte mais d'une grande qualit\u00e9. Les plats sont tr\u00e8s savoureux et originaux. On conseille le hot dog qui est une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence et les autres plats sont des d\u00e9lices.\n\nLe service est agr\u00e9able et efficace. Les cocktails sont fameux !!!\n\nC'est mon point de chute pour boire un coup entre amis tout en pouvant manger sur place. Je suis un fan !
2;Visiting the Phoenix area, I wanted to try something that Phoenix yelpers raved about and Ted's Hot Dogs appeared with a 4-5 star rating from 7 yelpers!  We were excited about a place that serves up hot dogs and warrants five stars!\n\nEven though they sold burgers and sandwiches, you have to order some type of sausage or dog when that's what they are famed for.  My friend and I opted for the Polish Sausage ($3.25), the BF chose the Bratwurst ($3.29), and my other friend went for their Regular Hot Dog ($2.05).  I read about their fabulous milkshakes, so chose a Chocolate Shake ($3.05) and their amazing Onion Rings ($2.59).\n\nI requested all the sausages and dogs to be loaded up with everything, which looked like it included onions, peppers, a pickle spear, relish, ketchup, and mustard.  I must admit, they did look a bit smaller than what I'm used to.  And the cashier couldn't tell the difference between the Polish Sausage and the Bratwurst.\n\nIn terms of the hot dog, my friend was not impressed. He said the hot dog itself tasted like any other hot dog, but he did like all the fixings on top.  The polish sausage tasted a lot better than the bratwurst in my opinion.  You can see lots of spices and stuff in the polish sausage, but there wasn't enough kick for my tastes.\n\nThe chocolate milkshake was thick and made from real ice cream.  Their onion rings reminded me of an onion blossom because of their thin batter.  I wished they had a different kind of dipping sauce for it instead of ketchup.\n\nOverall, my experience at Ted's Hot Dogs was just okay.  Maybe it's a locals thing and you have to be a true local to really appreciate their hot dogs and sausages.  I guess I just had a little more in mind.\n\nSidenote: Cash only\n\nTotal cost: Less than $19.00 (You can see the photo of everything we ordered in the business profile pics!)
1;"I have eaten at lots of Mexican restaurant so I'm a pretty tough critic and this place was not that great.  I really was not that impressed. It's located inside the Cannery Casino so I'm sure it soaks up plenty of business from the people who are already there feeding slot machines their social security checks. I don't think I would go out of my way to walk through a smoky casino to eat here though. I find it funny that this place boasts \""Las Vegas Review Journal The Best of Las Vegas 2008\""... umm its 2011 that doesn't say much. I think the portions could have been better for the price. My girlfriend got fajitas and it was mostly vegetables. Overall our meal cost $29.17 before tip, I ate my whole meal and my girlfriend took home some vegetables.  I did like the chips and the two salsas and bean dip that came with it. If you're looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant go to VIVA ZAPATA'S it's just down the street on Craig and I-15 its way better."
2;"First off, my burger and tater tots were great. I got the large Porkster burger which is a hamburger patty topped with BBQ pulled pork - 10oz of meat overall. It came with cheese on a brioche bun and I could only finish half! The sweet potato tater tots were a nice side, especially with the pineapple terriyaki aioli sauce for dip. No complaints here!\n\nMy 10oz burger with tots, mom's 5oz burger with tots, and a lemonade came to just under $30. \n\nHowever, had a big disappointment with the lunch time service. Our server was nice but way too much of a space case. He was really attentive until we got our food and then went MIA as the lunch hour started to pick up. Never got another refill on my drink, had to grab the usher for a to-go box, and when we finally got his attention after waiting for a bit we asked for the check and to try out the dessert (\""Pot\"" brownie). Instead of dessert, we just got our check (sans dessert listed, with no mention of said dessert) so we just paid and left. Ain't nobody got time for that!"
4;"Excellent Sushi ! \n Spent the weekend in Montreal, and decided to give this place a try; we were not disappointed. \n The staff was friendly and knowledgable, and the food was fantastic. I actually felt bad eating it, because it was so expertly displayed. \n The Anaconda Roll and Spicy Tuna Tempura are must haves !"
0;"If you live in Ahwatukee, you know this is the ONLY hookah lounge nearby... the next closest ones being near ASU, some 7-15miles away...\nSammy. I can't tell you enough how disappointed I am in your negligence to run a business... \nWay too over priced.\nNO COAL SERVICE. I used to work at a hookah lounge- they try packing on 5 or 6 coals on top of the bowl so it will burn thru really fast, convincing the customer to either leave sooner (to free up room for more customers) or purchase another refil... I asked the employee if I could have a pair of tongs, thinking they simply forgot to bring out tongs, and he said 'customers aren't aloud to have tongs- they drop coals and burn themselves' do I look like i'm gunna burn myself?? the only thing burning is the tobacco- and that's cuz there's 5 fucking coals on it. OKAY, if I can't regulate the proper ashing and rotation of my coals, who will??? I have to flag you down and complain about the hookah before you'll even look at the coals....\n\nPOOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. due to the over-use of coals, only 2 people in my group of 4 got to smoke hookah before it turned to burnt ash. I told Sammy the bowl was unacceptable, and he agreed to load a different bowl, with different flavors (His excuse was \""Sometime that flavor doesn't taste good\"" SO WHY WOULD YOU SELL IT?!???) and then at the end of the night, he ended up charging us for the 2nd hookah. $50 for 2 terrible hookahs...\n\nand your alcohol.... is WAYYYYY overpriced.... $9 for a bottle of Dos Equis???\n\nhonestly, I understand the business a lot more than you do.\nIn order to stay in business as a hookah lounge, you need to provide much better service, switch to better quality tobacco, and cut your prices in half. then you will have more loyal returning clientele. I know you have SOME customers that return, but I blame that on their lack of knowledge and having not experienced what a GOOD hookah lounge has to offer.\n\nIf I could rate 0/5 starts, I would. I'll give you this- you have nice expensive TV's and your Furniture is rather comfortable....\n\nI have an idea, how about you hand over your business to me, let me fix it, and I'll pay you a percentage- it'll be more than what you're making now, AND you'll get to see how a business should be ran..."
4;I honestly loved it a lot it was really nice I loved the whole look of the place. The only thing that I did see that was bad was the hostess. As soon as we walked we had to say hi table for two but before she did that another waiter walked up to her and gave her a whole plate of food to hide under the table . I don't think people need to see that. But beside that I loved the place and the food is great and looks amazing
4;Desert Wireless saved the day!!   TWICE.  I frequently come to Vegas on vacay and somehow something always manages to happen to my phone...(Viva Las Vegas!) .....and always at the worst time.  This was the only place I could find closeby open at that day and time. (with a reasonable price).  They were so helpful and FAST.  Both times, they quickly fixed my phone.....no muss-no fuss.  The price was the best quoted of 4 places I called, and they didn't waste my time trying to sell me other products or find more things to charge me for.  They are very understanding on how stressful it can be to have a broken phone especially when you're not in your hometown.  PLUS they really know their stuff.  It's so refreshing to get help from TRULY tech-savvy and knowledgeable guys (not sales people).  I've referred my friends that come to town and they always leave happy.....distressed Vegas goers having no idea where to go when their phone drops in the pool, screen cracks, contacts are lost, etc. almost ruining their special event in Vegas...Look for Wookie and his guys to do their magic and all is well again.  THANK YOU DESERT WIRELESSSSSS!!!
2;"mehhh... its a post office. \n\nNow in the day and age where PPL interactions are less and less. I havn't really found a need to have any. \n\nEverything i've needed I got w/o speaking to anyone. (anti-social.. I mean.. this is the POST OFFICE after all.. no \""going postal on me\"")\n\nBut if your old fashion say.. (1990's..lol).. you can walk to the desk (after standing in line) and speak to anyone there. They are friendly and \""happy\"" to help.. WINK"
1;The restaurant was loud - difficult to hear and speak with your guests.  Service was not very good - had to ask multiple times for a beer.  Food was over salted.  Kale chips were atrocious.  But the decor was nice and would probably be a good place for a glass of wine.  We did not try the salads so we can't weigh in but our overall experience was disappointing.
1;Cons: Minus one star for the cloud of cigarette smoke that smacks you in the face as you walk in. Minus one star for NO 24 hour room service!! And minus one star for the lack of lighting in the bathroom. Those little tiny lights don't give off enough light to ensure my hair is in club-ready style. \n\nPros: Rooms are clean and reflect the newness of the hotel. Staff is super friendly and accommodating. \n\nOnly stayed here because it was close to Henderson where we were taking care of some business. A good locals hotel but will not be staying here again.
4;I have to mention...the customers who come here are chatty and slow.  A lot if them dont decision their financial needs quickly and need a lot of hand holding which slows down the line BUT the tellers are super nice amd patient. WE LOVE CESAR
3;This Goodwill is pretty big!\n\nThey have ton's a housewares here. In fact I found 2 amazing vintage pyrex pitchers here for a total of $5!  There's is plenty of stuff to paint in housewares too!\n\nThey have lots and lots of furniture at mostly fair prices! One day I saw a beautiful wardrobe for $50 in EXCELLENT shape! I also saw a beat up dresser that needed lots of love for $40. So pricing seems to be a bit off!\n\nThey have kids toys for good prices and usually in good shape!\n\nThe clothes..... though I haven't done lots of looking at clothes here when I do browse I only see blah things I would never buy. \n\nI have not had a bad experience with any staff here but I have never had a great one either.  They work but aren't very talkative!\n\nThat's why they lose a star the clothing and employees!
1;"Maybe we went on a bad day....\n\nYou know, there is a lot I can say about this place. I will keep it down to the important stuff.\n\nOf a table of six, three ordered omelettes with three ingredients each in them. All three omelettes had one of the ingredients missing. Only one omelette eater said anything and sent it back. Her omelette did not have the Jack cheese that she ordered. Ok, the waiter took the omelette back to the kitchen. Waiter then returns with the same omelette with a cold, hard slice of Jack on top of the omelette. You read me right. Instead of making a new omelette with cheese in it, some moron in the kitchen took the omelette, went to the refrigerator, grabbed a slice of Jack cheese, and just slapped it on top of the omelette. No melting. Just a cold slice of cheese slapped on top of an omelette. And then some idiot server thought that this was adequate and served it back to my friend. So, we all look at this omelette that has a slice of cold Jack cheese rocking back and forth over an omelette like a lever over a fulcrum with a look of incredible disbelief. So, with a moment of shock and hesitation, my friend asks, \""Uh, can I have the cheese melted?\"" Annoyed waiter disappears with omelette and returns with the omelette. It looked as though they just nuked the plate so that the cheese just melted on top of the omelette. (Apparently this is how cheese omelettes are made in Vegas because all omelettes I have seen in Vegas have cheese melted on top of them instead of within the egg so that the egg is held together with cheese). \n\nThings that make you go hmmm...."
4;This place hit the spot. \n\nStopped here before a movie and ate at the bar. We got just what we wanted: quick service and some good eats. \n\nI recommend the fried green beans with aioli  -- soooo good! Who knew I liked green beans?! And this trip I tried some sushi and got the spicy tuna roll. Although it was clearly not pieced together by an expert sushi chef, it was extremely fresh and delish (so who cares if it's not beautiful?!)
3;"Great place for tea! I was skeptical when it first opened next to several other successful coffee/tea shops, but I thought I'd give it a try! I was very pleasantly surprised with the great varieties of tea. The staff was very knowledgeable and eager to help me make a decision. They keep a little book about the different teas you can order, and I learned a lot by reading through it. That was pretty cool. They really want you to enjoy tea, not just spend your money, which is really nice.\n\nI liked the variety of places to sit as well. Good for groups, where you can sit on fun little seat things in a booth type area, or good to just grab a little solo table by yourself or with a date. The employees give you a little bell to ring if you need something, so otherwise you're left to yourself, which is kind of nice! I wouldn't say the atmosphere is \""cozy,\"" but it is pretty quiet!\n\nI've never been on an \""event\"" type of night, but I would love to stop in when they are having belly dancing!\n\nThe only thing I have to say is that when I have gone, it's been relatively dark. In my experience, it's not a great place to go and read a book since the lighting is dimmer."
1;"Madison offers a lot, but cannot offer everything...\n\nThis small deli looked promising in a Milwaukee Glorioso's type way; it was smallish, but had a full deli and plenty of Italian groceries. The staff seemed friendly and courteous, but lacked knowledge to answer questions about the cuisine and appropriate ingredients to apply. \n\nAnyway, I picked up a number of mid-higher range priced meats including prosciutto, capicola and Genoa salami. The prosciutto and capicola were riddled with so much pink fat (like black ice for meat) that it was difficult to chew and harder to swallow. My nine-year-old nearly choked. \n\nStop over for the more basic Italian necessities in the grocery section (pasta, coffee, candy and etc.), but avoid the meat section ... it just is not worth the hassle."
1;Service was great and drinks were spot on. The food was uninspired and bland. Food quality was suspect. The price was decent but you get what you pay for i guess. This is off my list, way better options. I can see maybe dropping in for lunch and grabbing a burger but that's it.
2;Not the best steak house from what I have seen, even between Capital Grills. The one in DC has better steaks.
4;Love this shop... They use my name every time I go in there, have helped me out on several occasions with small repairs when I have just walked in and when I took my bike in there for a tune-up they made it sparkle.  Bottom line, the whole team is incredibly helpful and a pleasure to do business with.
4;"Vegas, Vegas, Vegas!\n\nWent last year, stayed at Hooters with free rooms and good accommodations. We were looking for a good steak and egg breakfast place, locally and the operator at Hooters told us we HAVE to go to Ellis Island. We listened...\n\nIt was AMAZING! $5.99 for a good size piece of steak, eggs, potatoes and toast is too good to be true! I ordered a bloody mary, it was 4.50! Haha, this place is so cheap and awesome. \n\nOld school for sure!!! But you have to \""ask\"" for the special. Enjoy!"
4;"People that know me know that I am a baller on a budget.  Hotels are just some place to lay my head after a night on the town.  As long as my room is clean, and safe I have no real issues.  I do know a good hotel when I see it and this one is an overall positive experience of 4.5 stars but I rounded up to 5 because I would love to stay at this place again.  It's clean, modern, sleek but no place inside the hotel to grab food with the exception of Starbucks late night.  \n\nKeeping it to the point with a list:\n\n-- Love the smell.  No nasty cigarette odor here.\n-- For the quality of room, big, clean, full kitchen, with washer and  dryer.\n--  24 hr security to go to the elevators to get up to the rooms.\n-- Super fast check in.  In and out in less than a few minutes.\n-- Complimentary wifi (decent speed).  Sorry I have to clarify and thank Susan N for bringing to my attention that it is only free if you are a owner, Gold, or Diamond member.  If not, then it is $9.95 a day.\n-- Rooms are excellent.  Furniture is modern, colors are warm, layout is classy.  Down feather bed with smooth cotton sheeting.  Equipped with black out shutters.  That's right...  with a push of a button you can actually black out the whole place.  On top of that they have a projector where you can watch the game on the shutters around 90\"".  Awesome!\n-- Some very nice soaps, shampoo, and moisturizer is provided not the cheap bar of soap that breaks apart when you take a shower you get at some places. \n-- Free business center where you can use computers, and print things for free. There was a downside to this.  Read things I didn't care for.\n-- Location is off the Strip.  Like people have said it is connected to Planet Hollywood and Miracle Mile Shopping Mall.  \n-- Guests can use the gym at no charge.  \n\nThings I didn't care for:\n-- Valet is $20 a day\n-- No restaurant open 24 hours except Starbucks\n-- When I used their computer to print out my tickets someone hacked my email and started spamming people in my contact list.  \n\nIn the end, I would love to stay here again."
